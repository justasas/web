<i>-Let's go to the water!
- They're heading for the beach!</i>

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,314
<i>Down by the beach!</i>

4
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,607
<i>-Run!
-Look out!</i>

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>Run, Doc! No! Doc, no!</i>

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,986
<i>Don't stop moving!</i>

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,780
<i>They're down there!</i>

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>There they go! Okay.</i>

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,035
<i>Lay down! Lay down!
Lay down or I'll shoot you, goddamn it!</i>

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,578
<i>-Hurry up!
-Lay down!</i>

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,332
<i>That's right, shoot them!</i>

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>I give up, Mr. Glenn. Please!</i>

13
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>-Shut up, Henri!
-Please, don't hit me! Please!</i>

14
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,807
<i>Clean him up! Take him to the hole!
And call the press!</i>

15

<i>Dateline: San Francisco.</i>

16
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,522
<i>Alcatraz was the scene last night
of a dramatic escape attempt.</i>

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>Four desperate prisoners
were apprehended...</i>

18
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,985
<i>...on the rocky beach below the prison.</i>

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>The recently completed
Golden Gate Bridge serves as a backdrop.</i>

20
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,157
<i>So near, yet so far from freedom...</i>

21
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,912
<i>...the surviving escapees, Henri Young
and Rufus McCain are escorted back...</i>

22
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>...while their less fortunate cohorts
are destined for the morgue.</i>

23
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>The body of Doc Barker,
son of the infamous Ma Barker...</i>

24
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,341
<i>...lies bullet-riddled,
cooling on a steel gurney...</i>

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,677
<i>...attended by a triumphant guard.</i>

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>The jubilant correctional officers
who foiled the escape...</i>

27
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,519
<i>...congratulate each other
and reluctantly show their battle scars.</i>

28
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,982
<i>A proud Warden Humson,
supervisor of three penitentiaries...</i>

29
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,612
<i>...Folsom, San Quentin and Alcatraz,
and confidant of J. Edgar Hoover...</i>

30
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>...congratulates his troops.</i>

31
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,577
<i>Humson returns to his duties...</i>

32
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,455
<i>...as the inmates are sent
through metal detectors...</i>

33
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>...cells are searched,
extra guards are called up...</i>

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,546
<i>...and Alcatraz goes on full alert
to forestall any additional trouble.</i>

35
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,758
<i>As public interest reached a frenzy...</i>

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,719
<i>...Warden Humson
and Associate Warden Glenn...</i>

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,597
<i>...left the island in the bay
for a press conference...</i>

38
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,433
<i>...headed for the San Francisco City Hall...</i>

39
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:26,271
<i>...which was inundated with a plethora
of reporters from around the globe...</i>

40
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>...all gathered to hear the official reaction.</i>

41
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,569
<i>Associate Warden Milton Glenn...</i>

42
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,030
<i>...introduces Warden John Humson.</i>

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,159
Warden Humson will now make
a brief statement and...

44
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,955
...if you please, no questions at the end.
Thank you.

45
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,166
l just want to reassure
the American people that...

46
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,837
...Alcatraz is an escape-proof prison.

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,589
They have nothing to fear.

48
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,884
<i>The inmates, McCain and Young...</i>

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,221
<i>...will be brought up on escape charges.</i>

50
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>There will be time in solitary confinement.</i>

51
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,977
<i>Privileges will be taken away from them.</i>

52
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,814

will begin.

<i>...I was in my first year of law school

67
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,785
How long?

68
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:15,190
<i>Alcatraz was opened as
a federal penitentiary in the spring of 1934.</i>

69
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,360
<i>In the era of the gangster...</i>

70
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,989
<i>...it was opened more for
the publicity value than the incarceration.</i>

71
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,325
<i>Alcatraz was the most feared prison
in the world...</i>

72
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,119
<i>...and the most expensive.</i>

73
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,163
<i>There were only so many Al Capones
and Machine Gun Kellys...</i>

74
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,125
<i>...so the prison had empty cells.</i>

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,130
<i>To justify the costs, the government took
incorrigibles from other prisons...</i>

76
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,466
<i>...men that had committed smaller,
more petty crimes...</i>

77
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,969

''Hallowing be Thy name.''

80
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,940
<i>Prior to 1938, there had been
five escape attempts.</i>

81
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,775
<i>No one had made it.</i>

82
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,279
<i>The reputation of Alcatraz as being
unescapable was secure.</i>

83
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,656
<i>Six inmates had died.</i>

84
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,993
<i>The ones who didn't die
sometimes wished they had.</i>

85
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,509
<i>The federal guideline regarding
solitary confinement states...</i>

86
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,513
<i>...that the maximum stay for an inmate
shall not exceed 19 days.</i>

1936:

104
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,485
American League Yankees visiting
National League Giants.

105
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,365
The Yankees score 18 runs...

...a series record and every single man

You stink, boy.

116
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,016

00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,317
They were fucking killing you.

121
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,152
You did good.

122
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,823
<i>The only other survivor
of the escape attempt was Rufus McCain.</i>

123
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,994
<i>He had betrayed his fellow inmates
by tipping off the associate warden.</i>

124
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,539
<i>McCain was rewarded
and left in the general population.</i>

<i>Henri.</i>

128
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,304
Some men are broken...

00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,182
...by the laws that they break...

130
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,727
...unable to resist...

131

...that society has set down.

135
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,624
You're not one of them.

136
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,549
Henri, l have a job to do here at Alcatraz.

137
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,384
Do you know what that is?

138
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,261
To protect you...

139
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,305
...from yourself.

140
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,267
You were among the selected sinners...

141
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,437
...the state set apart
so that you could simmer in scum.

142
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,441
The good people of the United States
have decided...

143
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,944
...that you are better off here.

144
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,656
l had nothing to do with that decision.

145
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,287
But where l play a part in your life is
to make sure that you stay here.

146
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,749
That you rehabilitate yourself...

147
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,293
...become a model prisoner...

148
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,462
...a better human being.

149
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,590
That's my job, Henri.

150
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,801
You too have a job.

151
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,304
And trying to escape...

152
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:28,100
...is not one of the duties
of your job description. Understand?

153
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,643
ln life...

154
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,106
...for every action...

155
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,319
...there is a definite and distinct reaction.

156
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,114
Action...

157
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,786
...reaction.

158
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,081
-Yes, Mr. Glenn.
-Now, if you escape, action:

159
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,667
l lose my job.

160
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,503
Reaction: l have a family...

161
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,673
...that l will not be able to provide for!

162
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,301
l'm not done yet.

163
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,512
Now, knowing this information...

164
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,431
...can you tell me...

165
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,851
...why you would possibly
want to escape...

166
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,896
...and jeopardize my family?

167
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,780
l've done nothing to you but my job.

168
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,492
And instead of letting you learn...

169
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,205
...by breaking the rules,
l feel l need to show you how to...

170
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,623
...obey them.

171
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,416
Tolerance.

172
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,752
Tolerance for pain.

173
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,047
My tolerance of you.

174
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,425
But tolerance can be mistaken
for kindness.

175
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,304
And kindness can be mistaken
for weakness.

176
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,016
And we can't have weakness,
can we, Henri?

177
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,936
l understand. l will be good.

178
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,188
l'm not gonna try and run again.

179
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,523
No, you won't.

180
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,691
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

181
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,027
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

182
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,112
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

183
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,573
Action, reaction.

184
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:09,785
Good.

185
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,079
Good.

186
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,792
Good.

187
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,261
Clean him up, take him to the hole.

188
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,056
<i>Christmas, 1939,
I celebrated visiting with my brother.</i>

189
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,142
<i>Henri Young celebrated in Alcatraz.</i>

190
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,439
<i>''Let nothing you dismay</i>

191
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,735
<i>''Remember Christ our Savior

192

<i>''To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray</i>

193
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,662
<i>''Oh, tidings of comfort and joy''</i>

194
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,849
Stop it!

195
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,601
Get in there!

196
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,687
Please, no, no! Please, don't put me back!

197
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,647
Please, don't put me back!

198
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,441
Please, don't put me back!

199
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,486
l don't want to! l don't want to! No!

200
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,535
They sound great.

201
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,329
Merry Christmas.

202
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,877
''Standing 'round a flagpole
And he caught himself a head cold''

203
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,631
He sings it over and over.
l can't get him to shut up.

204
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,132
lt gets on your nerves.

205
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,302
<i>In January of 1941,
I had passed the bar exam.</i>

206
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,473
<i>Henri Young was in his third year
of rehabilitation.</i>

207
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,729
<i>Welcome to Alcatraz, gentlemen.</i>

208
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,648
<i>Step off the boat and onto the dock.</i>

209
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,903
<i>Eyes straight ahead at all times.</i>

210
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,907
<i>There was a boat
named after Warden Humson...</i>

211
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,826
<i>...which handled the traffic
to and from Alcatraz.</i>

212
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,831
<i>In the morning and afternoon, it shuttled
the children to San Francisco for classes.</i>

213
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,460
<i>It was also used to transport prisoners
to the island.</i>

214
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,421
<i>When possible, having children
and prisoners on the boat...</i>

215
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,549
<i>...at the same time was avoided.</i>

216
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,010
<i>Don't look at the children.</i>

217
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,305
l'll take the kids to the city.

218
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,890
We'll go shopping.

219
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,518
Honey, can l call you back?

220
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,228
The warden's here.

221
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:44,898
Good morning, Warden.

222
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,191
Good morning.

223
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,529
-When did you arrive on the island?
-About 20 minutes ago.

224
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,280
Good.

225
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,823
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

226
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,243
Mr. Glenn...

227
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,121
...l've been going over
the rotation figures...

228
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,040
...in the solitary-confinement cells.

229
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,084
ls there something wrong?

230
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,129
Well, l don't know.
l don't think this can be right.

231
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,547
What's that?

232
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,382
Here, 244.

233
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,887
According to this, he's been in there
since March of '38.

234
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,224
l don't believe there's been
an attitude change with regard to 244.

235
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,935
He's not like the other inmates.

236
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,687
That's over three years!

237
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,398
He masterminded
the escape attempt in '38.

238
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,442
There hasn't been one since.

239
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,321
<i>If you let those animals believe
that escape is possible...</i>

240
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,116
<i>...you might as well stick in
a revolving door.</i>

241
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,577
<i>I think he has learned his lesson.</i>

242
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,374
Come on, Henri. Let's go.

243
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,423
<i>Henri Young had been rehabilitated.</i>

244
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,761
<i>I was now a public defender
in San Francisco. We'd meet in three days.</i>

245
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,679
Eat, Young!

246
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,808
You know the rules!
You don't eat, you go to solitary!

247
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,354
Now, get with it!

248
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,608
<i>Two times two is four.</i>

249
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,818
<i>Two times three is six.</i>

250
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,154
<i>Two times four is eight.</i>

251
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,906
<i>Eight.</i>

252
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,908
<i>Two times five...</i>

253
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,034
<i>...ten.</i>

254
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,620
<i>Twelve times...</i>

255
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,955
<i>...eight...</i>

256
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,041
<i>...ninety-six.</i>

257
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,840
<i>Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe more--</i>

258
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,390
Henri, McCain, he put you in the hole.

259
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,141
Put you in the hole.

260
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,352
McCain's still here. Look!

261
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,313
<i>McCain put you in the hole!
Put you in the hole!</i>

262
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,942
<i>McCain, he put you in the hole.
Put you in the hole!</i>

263
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,816
Get them back!

264
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,819
Get them back against the wall now!

265
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,362
Do it now!

266
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,531
What happened?

267
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,241
l don't know.

268
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,529

No, this can't be right.

00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,174
lt's right.

276
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,509

Come on, boy!

You can do it! You've got four furlongs!

Don't be cursing this street!

287
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:28,140
Pick them up and lay them down!
Let those legs pump like pistons!

Yes! Come on! The spirit is willing!

Come on!

290

Pump it! Go!

291
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,026
Remember Jesse Owens

Maybe tomorrow, sonny boy!

Watch it, buster!

294
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,451
Sorry, Counselor!

295
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,453
You're all right?

296
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,497
Mary, l'm sorry.

297
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,375
l'm sorry. Mary, you okay?

298
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,710
-Stop that!
-Okay, l'm sorry!

299
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,256
lf Henkin saw us, he wouldn't think twice
about suspending us.

300
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,757
-All right.
-Fix your tie.

301
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:44,800
Why?

302
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,761
You need to look good
when you thank Henkin.

303
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,889
What do l want to thank Henkin for?
The man's a cretin.

304
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,184
-He's given you a case.
-Case of what? Scotch?

305
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,603
Yes, James, a case of Scotch.

306
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,523
An actual case where l stand
in front of a jury?

307
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,985
-Federal murder one, no less.
-Henri Young.

308
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:07,239
He's a convict who killed another convict
in front of 200 witnesses.

309
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,450
Was it self-defense?

310
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,743
With a spoon.

311
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,161
What with a spoon?

312
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,498
That was the murder weapon.
He used a spoon to kill the man.

313
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,001
Weren't any forks or knives available?

314
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,003
My first case l can't possibly win.

315
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:25,007
Do this one for the experience, for the next
time, when maybe your guy didn't do it.

316
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,425
You could learn a lot.

317
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,594
Go see your client
and make nice to Henkin.

318
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,888
-l'll see you tonight?
-Maybe.

319
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,393
Thank you for your confidence in me
in getting this case.

320
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,688
l don't have any confidence in you.
The guy is guilty.

321
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:43,108
A monkey could try this case
and not make it any worse.

322
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,068
-l see.
-Remember that.

323
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,987
-Thank you, sir.
-A monkey.

324
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,782
l guess l'm a monkey.

325
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:14,056
-James Stamphill to see Henri Young.
-l need you to sign the release.

326
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,853
-lt's a nice day.
-Yeah, great.

327
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,928
Where are you going?

328
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,763
To the cell, talk to my client.

329
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:56,265
What, are you nuts?

330
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,517
l want to speak to him face to face.

331
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:00,686
Well....

332
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,023
You've already signed the release.

333
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,947
lt's your life.

334
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:17,661
Hi.

335
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,914
So, then, Mr. Young, is it?

336
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,335
You're Mr. Young, is that correct?

337
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,339
Mr. Young, that is your name, isn't it?

338
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:30,549
Henri Young?

339
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:37,222
l'll just assume that's your name
until you tell me differently.

340
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,475
Mr. Young, l will be acting
as your defense attorney.

341
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,103
l'm James Stamphill
and anything you tell me...

342
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,815
...will be protected under the rules
of confidentiality...

343
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,068
...of the attorney-client relationship.
So feel completely free...

344
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:53,488
...to answer my questions
in an honest and forthright fashion.

345
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:56,867
Just for the record,
your name is Henri Young, right?

346
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,499
This isn't an admission of guilt.
lt's just your name.

347
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,753
You speak English?

348
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,217
Yeah, you do speak English.
lt says so right here in the file.

349
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,099
Mr. Young...

350
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,481
...l am your attorney but l can't provide you
with much of a defense if one of us is...

351
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,191
...catatonic.

352
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,276
You see...

353
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:35,656
...we both have to be able and willing
to answer when our name is called.

354
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,827
Can you hear?

355
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,638
Mr. Young?

356
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,141
You okay, Mr. Young?

357
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,978
<i>Henri Young was born in Kansas in 1913.</i>

358
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,982
<i>His parents died ten years later...</i>

359
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,317
<i>...leaving Henri to raise his younger sister.</i>

360
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:17,281
<i>At the age of 17, Henri went into
a local store to try to get a job.</i>

361
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,826
<i>He was refused work.</i>

362
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:26,123
<i>Out of desperation he reached
into the cash register and took $5.</i>

363
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,502
<i>The store also doubled
as the town's post office.</i>

364
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,883
<i>Henri was tried and convicted
of the federal crime of mail robbery.</i>

365
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,387
<i>Henri's sister was taken
to live in an orphanage.</i>

366
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,183
<i>He would never see her again.</i>

367
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,812
<i>Eleven years later,
Henri would kill Rufus McCain.</i>

368
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,341
Mr. Young...

369
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,718
...you killed a guy, so...

370
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,221
...you're not catatonic.

371
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,475
l know that you can talk.

372
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,936
l don't know...

373
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,397
...maybe you could write something.

374
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,528
You want to write something? Write here.

375
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,324
Something. Just....

376
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,452
Look, you want to give it a try?

377
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,204
You want to write?

378
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,085
Something...

379
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,461
...please.

380
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,757
Mr. Young, you're looking at me.

381
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,926
You hear me, don't you?

382
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:07,099
lf you won't answer my questions,
maybe we can start with something else.

383
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,977
What do you want?
There has to be something.

384
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,064
Can't be to sit there, because if you do,
they'll just stick you in the gas chamber.

385
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,774
Do you understand that?

386
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,080
Look...

387
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,293
...Mr. Young, l've read your file.

388
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,713
l am trying to help you.

389
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:41,466
That's all l'm trying to do.
l just want to help you.

390
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,552
Maybe there are...

391
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,638
...extenuating circumstances in your case.

392
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,476
Getting sentenced to Leavenworth
for stealing...

393
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,604
...$500, that's extenuating.

394
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:01,278
You have to understand, l'm on your side.

395
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,404
$5.

396
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,822
What, Mr. Young?

397
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,826
lt was $5, not $500.

398
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:12,831
l knew you had it in you. Now, come on.
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

399
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,251
You just talked. Don't do this again.

400
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,130
Come on, don't quit now.
Come on, you just talked!

401
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,299
Why did you kill McCain?

402
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:29,556
What?

403
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,351
-What are you saying?
-How....

404
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,936
How? How? How?

405
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,188
Are you saying ''how''?

406
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,272
How.

407
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:38,857
How?

408
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:40,526
How.

409
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,948
How. What are you, a fucking lndian?
Don't quit now. How what?

410
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:46,907
How is....

411
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,619
You want to know how somebody is?
l'll find out immediately.

412
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,037
How is....

413
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:53,455
Who?

414
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,706
DiMaggio.

415
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,667
How is DiMaggio?

416
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,211
ls he a prisoner over at Alcatraz?

417
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:00,879
How is...

418
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,422
...DiMaggio...

419
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,091
...doing this year?

420
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,095
DiMaggio, the baseball player?

421
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:09,596
Yeah.

422
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,686
How is Joe DiMaggio, the baseball player,
doing? That's what you're asking?

423
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,152
Mr. Young...

424
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,575
...l don't really follow baseball.

425
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,119
You know.

426
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:45,007
<i>Excuse me, Mr. McNeil,
I'm James Stamphill.</i>

427
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:48,135
-Counsel for Henri Young.
-Yes.

428
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,180
l was wondering if l could talk to you
about continuance?

429
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,222
No.

430
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,100
You don't understand.
He just sits there and won't speak.

431
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:59,146
Maybe he's practicing for the gas chamber.
Tell him to take deep breaths.

432
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,941
You won't even consider a joint motion
in the interest of justice?

433
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:06,361
-Are you old enough to be a lawyer?
-Yes, sir, l am.

434
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,822
No joint motion for a continuance.

435
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:12,034
No psychiatrist.
And trust me, pal, no plea bargain.

436
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,869
Your boy's gonna suck the pipe.

437
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:17,998
l don't know who you pissed off
to get this shit case and l don't care.

438
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,082
No breaks.

439
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,012
Mr. Young, DiMaggio is having
a great year.

440
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,766
Last year he was the American League
batting champ with a .352 average...

441
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:40,145
...which was just a bit off the year before
when he had a .381 average.

442
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,648
The Yankees, they too had a good year.

443
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,234
New York defeated Chicago 4-0...

444
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,737
...led by jolting Joe DiMaggio hitting 400.

445
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:51,740
400, that's pretty good, isn't it?

446
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,410
June 1 7, 1941 ...

447
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:59,498
...our friend DiMaggio hits safely
in 32 straight games.

448
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,335
Twelve more and he will tie
Wee Willie Keeler's all-time record...

449
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:06,713
...who set the mark in 1897
for the Baltimore Orioles.

450
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:11,510
Joe Louis was the victor in what some
consider the toughest win of his career.

451
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,561
Here we go.
Here's some entertainment news.

452
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:21,854
Betty Grable.

453
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,021
See?

454
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:27,484
Says here she's just--

455
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,736
How old are you?

456
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,196
What, Mr. Young?

457
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,740
How old are you?

458
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,702
l'm 24.

459
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:41,915
l think...

460
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,042
...l am too.

461
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,046
No, you're...

462
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,591
...you're 28.

463
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:07,733
Would you like me to keep reading to you?

464
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:20,162
This ought to make you
a little bit more comfortable.

465
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:39,640
The defense requests a new jury.
Having been eliminated from this process--

466
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,141
Three new members.

467
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,601
And that's it.

468
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,061
Next.

469
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,273
The defense requests a continuance
of 60 days...

470
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,192
...so l may confer with my client--

471
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,402
He doesn't need 60 days.

472
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,656
The facts in this case are so clear,
six minutes should do it.

473
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,033
My client has been almost catatonic.

474
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:01,036
-Yesterday was the first day--
-He wasn't so catatonic...

475
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,457
...that he couldn't walk over and slit
a guy's throat in front of 200 witnesses.

476
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,711
ls it your contention
that the defendant is insane?

477
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:12,339
ls that what you mean by ''catatonic''?

478
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,676
Approach the bench, Counselor.

479
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:20,305
ls this laying the groundwork...

480
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,100
...for a not-guilty by reason
of insanity plea?

481
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,271
l don't know yet. l haven't even spoken
to him about the case--

482
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,439
One week, Counselor.

483
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:32,985
Then you will either tell me
you are ready for the trial...

484
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:37,114
...or you will come in here with a request
for a competency hearing.

485
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,532
One week.

486
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,786
This court is in recess.

487
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,305
Mr. Young, you and me,
we've got to talk now.

488
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,849
Would you like a cigarette?

489
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,309
No, thanks.

490
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,436
That shit will kill you.

491
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:09,897
That's...

492
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:11,523
...kind of funny.

493
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,859
''That shit'll kill you.''

494
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:17,696
l'll die in that gas chamber anyway,
so that's kind of a joke.

495
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,324
What's this about Nazis? We at war?

496
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,534
No, not yet, Mr. Young.

497
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,203
-lt's brand new.
-What?

498
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,413
-Mr. Glenn told me.
-The associate warden?

499
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:30,042
He says it's brand new.
He said they're gonna try it out on me.

500
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,255
No.

501
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,884
You only have a week.

502
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:41,345
You've got to talk to me. Okay?

503
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:44,097
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

504
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,976
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

505
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,608
How could you not know about baseball?

506
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,238
You said, ''l don't follow baseball.''

507
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,281
-How could you not?
-Why'd you kill him?

508
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:04,952
Over and over, it must have been
maybe a year, l don't know.

509
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:07,037
All l did was hear them in my head.

510
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,499
What are you talking about?
Are you talking about McCain?

511
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:14,086
l'm talking about baseball.
The great American pastime.

512
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,548
l went over every game
l ever heard on the radio.

513
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:22,261
l went over every game l ever heard.
Just playing them over in my head.

514
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:26,056
You had all those games to go to...

515
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,225
...and you didn't even care.

516
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:30,394
l'm talking about Rufus McCain.

517
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,106
l'm talking about three fucking years
they had me in that bucket!

518
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,066
Three fucking years!

519
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:40,279
Without any fucking light!
You had all those games to listen to!

520
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,491
You didn't even know
what DiMaggio hit this year.

521
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,328
What kind of asshole are you?

522
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:51,415
Calm down, boy!

523
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:57,212
You know the average length of time
an inmate would be in solitary?

524
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,297
Nineteen days.

525
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,966
l understand, but he killed a man.

526
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:04,052
Henry did three years in total darkness.
ln a black hole.

527
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,764
That's tragic, but he took a life.
Your brother will tell you what l did.

528
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:10,726
-You won't get him off.
-He's the best lawyer l know.

529
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:14,855
He can tell me if we've got a chance
for some kind of insanity plea.

530
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,940
Your brother won't give a damn.

531
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,984
<i>Your client is a two-time loser.</i>

532
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:22,779
This case is much more
about you than him.

533
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:24,948
He has no future.

534
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:29,161
This is your first time in the spotlight.
lt's what you worked for.

535
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,580
This case is a lost cause...

536
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,750
...so you must handle it like a lost cause.

537
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,093
Maybe you're right,
but the guy's not exactly Al Capone.

538
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,095
No, he isn't.

539
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:51,475
All they had him on was
income tax evasion. Your boy...

540
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,269
...they got on murder one.

541
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:55,979
Hi.

542
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,231
How are you?

543
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:58,982
Hi, Henri.

544
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,359
Listen.

545
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,612
You're not mad at me
for blowing up at you yesterday?

546
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,239
Nobody talks back.

547
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:06,907
No, l'm not mad at you.

548
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,492
l'll get the hang of it.

549
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,035
l got a sense of humor.

550
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,704
We gonna have some good times
before this is through.

551
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:15,457
You know how to play cards?
Could you get some?

552
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,709
l set this up for you. Sit down.

553
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,671
How much light got into the cell
you spent three years in?

554
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,174
-Like when you offered me a cigarette.
-l want to get that straight.

555
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:25,676
That was pretty good, huh?

556
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,720
You gotta help me if l'm going
to defend you now.

557
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,389
Yeah, sure, sure.

558
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,225
Have a look here.

559
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:37,896
Did you kill this man here? Rufus McCain?

560
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,233
l must have. l'm here.

561
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,653
l don't remember it,
but everybody saw me, so, yeah.

562
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,989
-But you don't remember it?
-No. So what?

563
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,323
Did you want to?

564
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:51,493
Once there was this spider
that crawled over me.

565
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,287
lt was like having company.

566
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:56,331
l looked for him again, couldn't find him.
He had a way out.

567
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,709
McCain landed you in the bucket, right?

568
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,919
142 times 93. Ask me that one.

569
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:04,298
-How long after you came out--
-13,206.

570
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:08,135
13,000? You mean, days?
What are you talking about?

571
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,929
No, that's the answer. 142 times 93.

572
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:14,057
-Concentrate on what l'm saying!
-l know what you're saying.

573
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,352
-How long was it?
-l don't know! l don't remember!

574
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:21,273
Who's the new girl l've seen in the papers?
lngrid Berger?

575
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,692
She's a looker. You seen her movies?

576
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,277
l want you to think!

577
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,904
l don't want to think!

578
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:29,948
l spent three goddamn years in the dark...

579
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,326
...smelling my own shit and piss...

580
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:34,286
...doing nothing but thinking!

581
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,829
l hate thinking!

582
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,379
l'm sorry, Henri.

583
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,220
l'm sorry.

584
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,556
l'm just trying to help you.

585
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,351
You got a girl, right?

586
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,312
Take your jacket off.

587
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,564
-What?
-Let me smell it.

588
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,317
You were easier to understand catatonic.

589
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,693
What's she like?

590
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,654
-Who?
-Your girl. That's perfume.

591
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,364
Let me smell your jacket.

592
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:14,076
l'll make you a deal.

593
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,621
l'll give my jacket, my pants,
whatever you want. Sports, girls....

594
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,749
But you gotta tell me just one memory
about something l ask.

595
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,125
Deal?

596
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:23,710
Sure.

597
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,762
l've never been with a girl.

598
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,688
Let me try it on.

599
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:46,233
How long was it you went
without any daylight?

600
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:49,027
<i>Did they ever let you out for any exercise?</i>

601
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,780
-Merry Christmas.
-Please, don't hit me.

602
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:54,700
-Get the tear gas.
-How long l been in here?

603
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,786
-You're out of the hole.
-l made it! l did it!

604
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,496
lt's Christmas, 1940.

605
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,748
You've been down there two years.

606
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,251
Two years!

607
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:06,253
l did it.

608
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:09,089
Two fucking years.

609
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,050
l made it. l made it.

610
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,678
l'm not too crazy, am l?

611
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,264
l did it! lt's over!

612
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,349
Nothing's over, Henri.

613
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,977
Thirty minutes exercise, that's all you get.

614
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:23,979
No!

615
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,485
You don't want it, we take you back.

616
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,528
No!

617
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:32,988
l want it!

618
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:34,489
l want it.

619
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,285
l'll be good. l'll be good.

620
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,171
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:</i>

621
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,465
<i>The defendant, Henri Young...</i>

622
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:54,468
<i>...is accused of murder in the first degree.</i>

623
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:58,555
<i>It is your responsibility,
as a juror, to deal with truth.</i>

624
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,141
<i>Rufus McCain was murdered...</i>

625
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,936
<i>...by Henri Young.</i>

626
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:05,562
<i>Mr. Stamphill...</i>

627
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:07,314
<i>...public defender...</i>

628
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:11,360
<i>...will play upon your sympathies.
He'll use every trick in the book.</i>

629
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:12,486
<i>Why?</i>

630
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,239
<i>To avoid the gas chamber.</i>

631
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,283
<i>The United States of America
will demand...</i>

632
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,911
<i>...that you return a verdict of guilty...</i>

633
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,621
<i>...so that this...</i>

634
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,540
<i>...this animal...</i>

635
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:27,918
<i>...will receive the punishment
commanded by the Bible.</i>

636
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,837
<i>''An eye for an eye.''</i>

637
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,339
<i>A life for a life.</i>

638
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:35,425
<i>For if ever there was a man
guilty of murder...</i>

639
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,428
...it is Henri Young.

640
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,933
And if ever a man deserved
to die for that crime...

641
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,978
...it is the accused.

642
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:52,150
Thank you very much, Mr. McNeil.

643
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:58,824
Mr. Stamphill, are you prepared
to make your opening statement?

644
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:00,701
Your Honor...

645
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,161
...ladies and gentlemen of the jury:

646
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:08,542
When l was a kid, my heroes
weren't Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig...

647
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:11,253
...they were Clarence Darrow
and Émile Zola.

648
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:14,298
ln other words, l have waited
for this moment all my life.

649
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,509
To stand, like l am, in front of a jury
of 12 good people...

650
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:21,263
...to plead the case of an innocent man
who's been unjustly accused.

651
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,348
The only problem is he did it.

652
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,852
l know it, the prosecutor, Mr. McNeil,
knows it.

653
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,398
Henri doesn't know it 'cause he can't
remember it, but he won't deny he did it.

654
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,860
All those witnesses the prosecutor
will bring forth will tell you...

655
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,362
...Henri Young killed Rufus McCain.

656
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:41,909
Now that we all know that,
why don't we find the man guilty...

657
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,204
...and gas him because that's
what we all know is going to happen?

658
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:46,455
Right, Henri?

659
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,539
What?

660
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:53,337
There's only one problem that'll keep us
from wrapping this up in record time.

661
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:57,508
Henri Young did not act alone.
They haven't caught all the killers.

662
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:02,346
There was a co-conspirator. Because of
this co-conspirator, whom we shall name...

663
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:05,390
...Henri Young is innocent
of the crime of murder.

664
00:46:05,474 --> 00:46:06,517
What?

665
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:09,102
Objection, Your Honor! l must protest!

666
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,729
l figured you would.

667
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,481
This is absurd.

668
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:16,818
Before the counselor is allowed to waste
this court's time and this jury's time...

669
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:21,490
...l'd request that he supply some proof
or evidence of this co-conspirator.

670
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:25,953
Can you bring forward evidence
of the existence of a co-conspirator?

671
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:30,332
Not at this time, but it is my intention
to do so during the course of the trial.

672
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:34,253
He's not going to provide such proof
because no proof exists.

673
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,631
This man spent three years
in solitary confinement...

674
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,801
...during which time no one had
any influence over him...

675
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:43,512
...because no one had
any contact with him.

676
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,099
He came out of solitary.
He went directly to a shower.

677
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:51,562
Then he went directly to a haircut.
Then he went directly to the dining hall...

678
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:54,606
...where one convict had said
one sentence to him.

679
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,276
This does not a co-conspirator make.

680
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:00,362
l'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.

681
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,282
Unless you can justify
that line of defense...

682
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:06,118
...l will sustain the prosecution's objection.

683
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:10,330
The district attorney, with his own words,
has just made my case for me.

684
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:11,999
That'll be the day.

685
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,834
Your Honor...

686
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:17,671
...for three years,
three long, tortuous years...

687
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:21,717
...no one and nothing had any influence
whatsoever over Henri Young.

688
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,510
No one and nothing.

689
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,514
This was a man whose only crime was
to steal $5 from a local post office...

690
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,558
...to feed his starving sister.

691
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:33,353
He came to Alcatraz a petty criminal
who had never harmed...

692
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,315
...or attempted to harm
another human being in his life.

693
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:39,943
He came out of the dungeon a vicious,
barbaric, maniacal murderer.

694
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,821
A man who had been put
into a psychological coma.

695
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,407
Within an hour of coming out
of that hell hole...

696
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:48,827
...he did what would've been unthinkable
to him three years before.

697
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:50,162
Unthinkable!

698
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,665
His only thought was murder!
His only instinct was murder.

699
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:55,542
His first act was murder!

700
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:59,338
He himself was a murder weapon,
but the hand that held that weapon...

701
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:02,966
...and plunged it into the throat of McCain
belonged to someone else.

702
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:05,344
l point to Associate Warden, Mr. Glenn...

703
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:09,556
...Warden Humson and the institution
known as Alcatraz and say, ''l accuse! ''

704
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:12,768
-Objection!
-l accuse them individually and collectively.

705
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:16,146
l accuse Alcatraz of the torture
of Henri Young!

706
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:19,358
-l accuse Alcatraz of McCain's murder!
-Come to order!

707
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:22,152
Silence! This court will come to order!

708
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:28,158
Henri Young is not going to be
the only defendant here!

709
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:30,035
Alcatraz is on trial!

710
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:33,038
<i>I will address your objection
tomorrow morning!</i>

711
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,876
<i>Henri Young, on trial for his life, is seen
leaving the San Francisco courthouse...</i>

712
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,214
<i>...followed by his young and now very
popular public defender, James Stamphill.</i>

713
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:46,426
<i>Stamphill has accused the infamous Rock
of torture, using the tag line...</i>

714
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,512
<i>...''crimes against humanity.''</i>

715
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,890
<i>He has turned the once quiet trial
of a convict killing...</i>

716
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,934
<i>...into a media circus.</i>

717
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:56,562
ln most cases, they do get better.

718
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:00,315
ln the case of Henri Young...

719
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:03,318
...this happens not to be true.

720
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,820
Young is a...

721
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:06,363
...noisemaker.

722
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:09,700
Some prisoners have a problem
when they're in...

723
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,202
...solitary.

724
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,914
All we do is try to discourage misconduct.

725
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:20,752
<i>This is the first verbal attack
on the jewel of the prison system.</i>

726
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:24,840
<i>This bastion that houses evil
opened in 1934.</i>

727
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,467
<i>It brought gangsters like Capone...</i>

728
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:32,347
<i>...Machine Gun Kelly and Henri Young
close to the magical city by the bay...</i>

729
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:36,310
<i>...less than one half-mile
from the world-famous Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

730
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:39,354
<i>We went to the streets
to find out public opinion.</i>

731
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,482
You can't put a place on trial.
lt's a prison for prisoners.

732
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:46,236
Now the murderers are accusing
the wardens of this and that.

733
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,905
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

734
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,073
Humson seems like a good guy.

735
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,451
lf Alcatraz wasn't here l wouldn't live here.

736
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,287
-You think it's too close?
-l think it's perfect.

737
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,456
He's innocent until proven guilty.

738
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:00,792
He'll get a fair trial, but, nonetheless,
he's a murderer.

739
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:03,504
<i>This grizzly evidence bears mute witness...</i>

740
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:06,757
<i>...to the brutal crime
perpetrated by Henri Young.</i>

741
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,800
<i>Note the spoon.</i>

742
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,345
<i>Can a prison be put on trial?</i>

743
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,389
<i>Judge Clawson's ruling tomorrow
may clear the way...</i>

744
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,558
<i>...to put Alcatraz on trial.</i>

745
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:20,646
''The warden can be relied upon
to carry out the instructions...

746
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,482
''...of the Bureau, that no brutality...

747
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,568
''...or inhumanity shall be practiced.

748
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:30,113
''Sustained food and medical attention
shall be given.''

749
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,534
We have wholeheartedly followed
those instructions.

750
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:34,868
Thank you.

751
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:37,371
<i>So many opinions being expressed.</i>

752
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,832
<i>We attempted to get a statement
from the recent Harvard graduate...</i>

753
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,335
<i>...assigned to defend Henri Young.</i>

754
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:46,964
Why don't we keep the trial
in the courtroom? Thank you.

755
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:51,718
l would like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

756
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,513
Mr. Stamphill, you are hereby
put on notice...

757
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,683
...that this court has no interest
in newspaper headlines...

758
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,893
...and will not be swayed by them.

759
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:05,524
l further admonish that counsel's attempts
to try this case in the press...

760
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:09,361
...and not before this court,
will put him in the utmost peril.

761
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,490
ls that clear, Mr. Stamphill?

762
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,117
Yes, Your Honor.

763
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,493
Good.

764
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,079
Bailiff, approach the bench.

765
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,083
Before l hand down my ruling
on Mr. McNeil's objection...

766
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:27,212
...l'd like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

767
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:31,550
While l cannot give legal advice
and sit on the bench at the same time...

768
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:35,429
...l will express grave concern
with the defense's strategy.

769
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,516
Counselor, l strongly recommend
you walk a straight line...

770
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,393
...in terms of your defense.

771
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:46,023
Anything you state in this courtroom
will be evaluated not only by the jury...

772
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:50,444
...but very closely scrutinized by myself.
ls that understood, Mr. Stamphill?

773
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:52,112
Yes, Your Honor.

774
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:53,697
Very well.

775
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,409
Prosecution's objection is overruled.

776
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,913
You may pursue your line of defense...

777
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,415
...concerning the penitentiary at Alcatraz...

778
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:07,044
...and l will rule on any objections
on a point-by-point basis.

779
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:08,462
Exception.

780
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:09,671
Noted.

781
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,299
Mr. McNeil, you may call
your first witness.

782
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,968
Prosecution calls Terrence Swenson.

783
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,763
Terrence Swenson.

784
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,858
Witness shall remain standing
until sworn in.

785
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:32,945
Put your hand on the Bible.

786
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,279
Cut it out.

787
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:37,324
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth...

788
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,284
...so help you God?

789
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:40,786
So help me God.

790
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,287
You may be seated.

791
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:47,459
Mr. Swenson, as a guard at Alcatraz,
did you know Henri Young?

792
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:48,794
Yes, sir.

793
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:51,171
Could you point him out for us?

794
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:54,424
That's him right over there, sir.

795
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,593
Thank you, Mr. Whitney.

796
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,136
Thank you.

797
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:01,515
Now, on the morning of June 1 1, 1941,
where were you?

798
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,560
l was on duty in the dining hall.

799
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,436
Everything was normal.

800
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,772
And l saw the defendant--

801
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:09,940
Henri Young.

802
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,400
That's correct.

803
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:13,986
l saw him standing over Rufus McCain.

804
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:16,280
He lifted up his chin and....

805
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:18,991
-Excuse me, l'm nervous.
-lt's all right.

806
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,577
And he plunged a metal object...

807
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:24,621
...which l later learned was a spoon...

808
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:26,415
...into McCain's throat.

809
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,001
He then ripped it open.

810
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,838
Did the defendant ever appear
to be ranting...

811
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:33,881
...or raving?

812
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:35,132
No, sir.

813
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,801
Mr. McKeon, was he frothing
at the mouth?

814
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:39,094
No, sir.

815
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,140
Did he in any way give the impression
of one who was insane?

816
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:46,560
Objection. This man is not
a qualified psychiatrist.

817
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:47,728
Sustained.

818
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:51,899
So, it appeared to you that it was a cool,
calculated and deliberate act?

819
00:53:52,274 --> 00:53:54,026
-Objection!
-Overruled.

820
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,570
The witness may answer the question.

821
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:59,823
Yes, sir. Young did it,
just as cool as a cucumber.

822
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:01,200
Thank you.

823
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:02,868
No further questions.

824
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:06,246
This court will reconvene
after the holiday...

825
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,956
...9:00 a.m., July 5.

826
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:09,208
All rise.

827
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,668
You should have played cards with me.

828
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:13,462
Alcatraz.

829
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:16,924
lt was built by the military
during the Civil War.

830
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:21,470
ln May of '33, the War Department
abandoned the island.

831
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:26,725
lt was leveled, all except for the lower
floor which is now used for storage.

832
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,145
Note to myself:
Get access to the lower level...

833
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,524
...because that's where the dungeons have
gotta be located.

834
00:54:33,649 --> 00:54:36,276
The only guard on record to be fired...

835
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:40,030
...or dismissed during Henri's solitary time
was Derek Simpson.

836
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,032
Locate Simpson.

837
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:45,702
The prison opened in June of '34
under Warden Humson.

838
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:49,540
He insisted on a high level
of guards to prisoners.

839
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,583
Glenn was the first appointee.

840
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,461
Mr. Henkin.

841
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:57,256
Two things: First of all, you work for me.

842
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:58,924
Let me finish!

843
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,554
You work for me, which means
when l call you, you drop everything.

844
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,390
Return my call or you will cease
to work for me.

845
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:08,976
l don't care if you're with Rita Hayworth!

846
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,435
Understand?

847
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,187
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

848
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,609
What the hell are you doing with this trial?

849
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:18,944
Defending my client.

850
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:21,572
Then why don't you defend him
for Christ's sake?

851
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,908
Try to knock down the charges
as a crime of passion or figure out...

852
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,452
...how you'll cross-examine
the witnesses...

853
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:32,165
...instead of this ''psychological coma'' crap
that doesn't mean anything in court!

854
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:34,543
l think it does. As long as it's my case--

855
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:39,089
Fair enough. l tried to talk reasonably
to you, but you're not going for it, so...

856
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,801
...you're not handling this case anymore.
lt's done.

857
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,303
Mr. Henkin...

858
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,974
...they're printing my opening statement
in 250 newspapers across the country.

859
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:52,477
lf you want me off the case because
you're afraid of taking on Alcatraz...

860
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,146
...that's your choice.

861
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,774
But l'll just go to Jerry Hoolihan
and tell my side of the story.

862
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,945
lf you want to play hardball, sir,
l'll play hardball too.

863
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,620
l'm trying to be your friend.

864
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:12,414
You know who the warden of Alcatraz is?

865
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,835
He's the most highly respected warden
in the US dealing with hardened criminals.

866
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:20,506
lf you try to make Humson
look like a Nazi...

867
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:23,217
...they will eat you for breakfast.

868
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:35,646
You'll die if l can't get corroboration
about what goes on over there.

869
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,732
l need names! Names of men
who'll come and testify.

870
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:42,277
What made you think
these men will come and testify?

871
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:45,072
Maybe you got some friends
you don't know about.

872
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:49,201
-You want to play cards?
-l'll make them testify with a court order!

873
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:52,371
What about when they're back
on the Rock with Mr. Glenn?

874
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:54,373
They'll kill them, that's what.

875
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:57,501
This is our only chance.
We're talking about your life.

876
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:01,547
For a smart guy, you're awfully slow.
l'm already dead. l told you that.

877
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:04,049
You can't change Alcatraz.

878
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:05,634
lt just is.

879
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:07,094
So why fight it?

880
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:11,265
You stand in court preaching. l don't
even know what you're talking about.

881
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,642
Justice. l'm talking about justice.

882
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,854
l killed him, they saw it,
they're going to kill me.

883
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,772
Nothing you say will change that.

884
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,358
So l don't see what you're
so excited about.

885
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,487
This trial doesn't interest you at all?
You don't care about it a bit?

886
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:29,616
You look like you're having
a good time, so....

887
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,910
No, l don't care.

888
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:36,373
Main thing is, l got a friend my age
to talk to until they gas me.

889
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:41,628
l'm not your friend, l'm your attorney.
l'm trying to save your life. Guard!

890
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,339
You know, l have a sister, but...

891
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,885
...l ain't seen her since they put me in jail.

892
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:50,137
l got nothing. l got nobody.

893
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:53,015
l don't need a lawyer. l need a friend.

894
00:57:53,682 --> 00:57:58,228
You're doing all this to prove something
to a guy named Darryl, not for me.

895
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,981
You want to do something for me?

896
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,442
Let's play cards.

897
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:08,739
Go ahead and play cards.
l got a case to try.

898
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,283
Hold it, Jim. Where are you going?

899
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,493
Where are you going?

900
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:26,173
<i>I'm Henri Young's attorney.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.</i>

901
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,135
<i>I'm going to call prisoners to the stand
to testify about life on Alcatraz.</i>

902
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,970
<i>Where are the dungeons?</i>

903
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,306
<i>What is solitary time
in those dungeons like?</i>

904
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:36,558
<i>I want the jury to know and understand.</i>

905
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,645
<i>You tell them to get caught
robbing a bank. They'll find out.</i>

906
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,105
l'm done talking.

907
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,788
Mr. Murphy...

908
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:02,376
...if we can get decent treatment for you,
it makes it possible for everyone.

909
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:07,047
lf we ignore cruelty in one place,
it makes it more acceptable everywhere.

910
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,258
l ain't gonna do shit for you.

911
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,678
You can't get me no good time
knocked off.

912
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:14,805
You can't get me no privileges.

913
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:18,809
You can't even get me seconds at dessert.
lf l testify for anybody...

914
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:22,145
...l testify for the DA.
He's got some juice here.

915
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:30,028
<i>Mr. Baker, could you tell me anything
about Henri Young?</i>

916
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:31,905
Don't know Henri Young.

917
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,534
Could you tell us anything
about Mr. Glenn?

918
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,872
Warden Glenn has always been
good to me.

919
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,210
Have you ever been in the dungeons?

920
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:48,130
l don't know nothing about no dungeons.

921
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,215
That's all, ma'am.

922
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:52,092
l gotta go now.

923
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:57,472
Fuck you.

924
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,059
Did Mr. Glenn tell you
not to cooperate with me?

925
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,769
Fuck you.

926
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,230
Where are the dungeons located?

927
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:07,816
Don't take my fucking picture!

928
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:15,032
You know l can get
a writ of habeas corpus testificandum...

929
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:17,701
...and force you to come
and testify in court?

930
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:19,077
Fuck you!

931
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:22,748
Thank you very much for your time.

932
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:24,416
Don't mention it.

933
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:28,045
And you, sweetheart....

934
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,255
l'd like to fuck you.

935
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,525
<i>I hope your day has been fruitful.</i>

936
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:54,655
l don't see your photographer.
ls he still taking pictures?

937
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,365
He's trying to.

938
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,451
We're not receiving a great deal
of cooperation.

939
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:03,205
lt almost seems as though someone told
the prisoners not to talk to us.

940
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,873
There's no conspiracy.

941
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:06,667
No one talked to them.

942
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,920
Maybe it's because they are
dangerous people who belong here...

943
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,047
...with no interest in you or your case.

944
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,259
-l'd like to see the dungeons.
-l'm sorry? Dungeons?

945
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,220
The old citadel, the sub-level of the prison.

946
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,180
That's mostly storage...

947
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,140
...a few solitary cells.

948
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:23,100
No dungeons.

949
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:26,395
l would like to see
the solitary-confinement cells.

950
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:29,106
l would love to show those cells to you,
but l can't.

951
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:33,694
lt's an insurance risk to visitors during a
riot. lf you're there, we can't protect you.

952
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:35,529
Thank you for your concern.

953
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:38,282
l could show you the exercise yard.

954
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:41,785
You have papers.

955
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:45,122
l have papers, so you can cut
the good-guy act.

956
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:49,168
l do consider myself
as one of the good guys...

957
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:51,503
...and perhaps more than you...

958
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,839
...l know what the bad guys are like.

959
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:56,008
l'd like to read them. Please.

960
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:58,468
Thank you.

961
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:01,805
That's a court order...

962
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:05,434
<i>...instructing you to permit us access
to the solitary-confinement cells.</i>

963
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:08,604
<i>And to allow the photographer
to take pictures of the same...</i>

964
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:11,732
<i>...to be used as exhibits in the trial
of The People vs. Young.</i>

965
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:14,067
<i>You are also instructed
to hand over to us...</i>

966
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:17,696
<i>...the complete medical
and disciplinary files as to therein.</i>

967
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,698
<i>If you refuse to do so...</i>

968
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:22,868
<i>...you'll have to appear in court
and show just cause.</i>

969
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:32,169
Why don't you take Miss McCasslin
out for some air?

970
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:34,046
l was told not to leave you alone.

971
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:38,342
l don't care. You may be used to
these conditions but obviously she's not.

972
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:43,722
We've been searched. Take her outside,
or we'll discuss this with Mr. Glenn.

973
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,182
All right.

974
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,725
No more photos.

975
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:49,102
You all right?

976
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:50,604
Thanks.

977
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:52,439
l just need some air.

978
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:16,797
My God!

979
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,488
My name's James Stamphill.
l'm Henri Young's attorney.

980
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:44,116
l can force them to let you out
so you can testify...

981
01:03:44,241 --> 01:03:46,201
<i>...in San Francisco in a court of law.</i>

982
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:50,330
<i>You just have to give me your name.
I promise I will do what I said for you.</i>

983
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,598
James, she's okay. Just needed some air.

984
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:12,519
Can we go now?

985
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,104
Feeling any better?

986
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,149
l guess l'll make it.

987
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:23,197
-Did you get anything?
-l got three names.

988
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:25,866
Let's go.

989
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:30,245
<i>Where did Stamphill get
the three names on this list?</i>

990
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,209
l don't know.

991
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:39,755
Can you trust these cons? They're smart
enough to look after their own interests.

992
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:41,006
They told Glenn...

993
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:45,385
<i>...James said he'd get them out of solitary
if they would testify for the defense...</i>

994
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:47,471
<i>-...and lie on the stand!
- That's a lie.</i>

995
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:51,934
<i>-He wanted to find one convict willing--
-Jesus, this is goddamn bribery.</i>

996
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:55,938
<i>It's prejudicing a witness.
You could get disbarred. It's gone too far.</i>

997
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,357
<i>Fire him. I don't care how you do it.</i>

998
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,859
Why do you have to make it be like this?

999
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,779
Henri Young's my client.
lt's my job to defend him !

1000
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:04,821
Not anymore.

1001
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:05,906
What?

1002
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,951
He's been notified that Henkin
wants you off the case.

1003
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:10,786
Henri will never go for it.

1004
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:13,747
-He did. He's been assigned a new lawyer.
-Who?

1005
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:16,333
Me.

1006
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:19,127
Me.

1007
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:23,173
Henkin assigned me to the case.
l could take it or be fired. l had no choice.

1008
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,133
You stabbed me in the back?

1009
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:28,136
l'm not stabbing you!
l'm trying to save your job and mine!

1010
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:32,099
What about Henri's life?
lsn't that more important than profit?

1011
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:34,977
l don't have a brother who's a partner
in a big law firm.

1012
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:39,106
There aren't any other jobs
waiting out there for a woman attorney.

1013
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:41,900
The only option l had was to do
what he told me to do.

1014
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,485
What could l have done?

1015
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:44,987
l'll see you.

1016
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:08,510
What we need to do is establish exactly....

1017
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:11,680
We have a lot of work to get to today,
if you don't mind.

1018
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:12,848
Stop that.

1019
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:15,767
Jesus Christ, all l was doing was looking.

1020
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:17,811
l want to set you straight--

1021
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:20,689
You set me straight
the minute you walked in.

1022
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,442
-Mr. Young--
-Please, call me Henri. Please.

1023
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:27,696
Mr. Young, l am not here to satisfy
any sexual fantasies that you may have.

1024
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:31,909
You're not?

1025
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:34,620
No, l'm your attorney.

1026
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:36,622
They're gonna kill me anyway.

1027
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:41,251
You won't do me any good as an attorney.
You may as well be good for something.

1028
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:44,880
-Mr. Young, l can't--
-Please, call me Henri, can't you?

1029
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:48,425
l just want to hear a lady call me Henri.

1030
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,927
Can't you, please?

1031
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:51,720
Just once.

1032
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:53,597
Please.

1033
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:57,601
Henri, listen, we have so--

1034
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:00,187
Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it.

1035
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:04,650
l'm gonna touch you just a little bit.

1036
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:05,901
Just a little.

1037
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:07,486
Are you crazy?

1038
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:10,447
Yeah, sure. lt won't hurt you
to let me touch you.

1039
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:13,742
Don't make me call the guard.
We're running late on....

1040
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:15,536
Stop that.

1041
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:18,247
Stop.

1042
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:20,249
Stop that! Stop that!

1043
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:22,751
l'm not touching you. l'm touching me.

1044
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,420
Guard!

1045
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,009
You have a problem?

1046
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,556
Did he do anything?

1047
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:39,518
No.

1048
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,395
Let me know if he does.

1049
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,313
No, l'd like to leave now.

1050
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:03,250
-He wants to see you in there.
-What?

1051
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:07,462
He wants to see you in there.

1052
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:39,870
So, why'd you want to meet here?
Neutral territory?

1053
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:45,876
Want to be my lawyer again?

1054
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:50,214
What happened to the other one?

1055
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:52,382
l don't know if l want her.

1056
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:54,593
Since l had her, l mean.

1057
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:57,888
She was good, though.

1058
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,892
She was everything l wanted
my first experience to be.

1059
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,561
l was just talking and she came over.

1060
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:07,856
-She started touching me--
-That's great. That's great.

1061
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:14,363
Jim, l'm just playing a joke on you.

1062
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:19,868
l know she was your girlfriend.

1063
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:23,330
l remember from the smell of the perfume
on your jacket.

1064
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,295
So, Lawyer...

1065
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,841
...you want to come back?

1066
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,260
l resigned.

1067
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,056
l guess that means
l'm in private practice now.

1068
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:44,142
l could've had her though.

1069
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:46,603
Of course...

1070
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:49,398
...she don't play cards.

1071
01:09:57,072 --> 01:09:59,074
<i>After I got arrested, they...</i>

1072
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:00,993
<i>...took my sister away.</i>

1073
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:02,870
<i>They...</i>

1074
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:06,081
<i>...put her in a home or orphanage and...</i>

1075
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:08,542
<i>...I don't know....</i>

1076
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,921
<i>I don't know what happened to her.
Never saw her again.</i>

1077
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,174
<i>My parents died when I was 7.</i>

1078
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:19,761
<i>It was just me and my brother, and he
didn't know anything about raising a child.</i>

1079
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,598
<i>He sent me off to boarding school.</i>

1080
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:25,017
<i>I did get to come home on holidays.</i>

1081
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,312
He put me through law school...

1082
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:31,607
...then got me the job
at the public defender's office.

1083
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,777
He wanted me to do well.

1084
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:41,200
We had a plan until you came along
and messed everything up.

1085
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,828
l wish l had been able to take care
of my little sister.

1086
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:46,830
l mean...

1087
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:48,790
...family's family, right?

1088
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:52,586
Henri, l'm sorry you're here.

1089
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,049
This here's paradise
compared to my last home.

1090
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:02,513
How about the case?
Do you want to talk about it a bit now?

1091
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,431
You never give up, do you?

1092
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:10,062
How about the Redskins?

1093
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:13,315
How do you think they'll do
against the Yankees this year?

1094
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:16,527
Redskins are a football team.

1095
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:18,654
Yankees are a baseball team.

1096
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:22,741
Personally, l think the Redskins
will kick the shit out of them.

1097
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,037
Henri, l'm trying.

1098
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:29,289
l know.

1099
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,543
This is going to be
a private conversation, Byron.

1100
01:11:33,168 --> 01:11:35,337
lt never took place, all right?

1101
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:38,340
-ls that all right, Thurgood?
-l suggested it.

1102
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:42,886
That brother of yours is making
quite a little name for himself.

1103
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:44,972
We even heard his name in Washington.

1104
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:47,307
My brother has resigned from the case.

1105
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:50,227
Well, he was hired back again last night.

1106
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:52,646
What do you mean he was hired back?

1107
01:11:56,775 --> 01:12:00,028
Your work here has been stellar.
l'd hate to see anything--

1108
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:01,864
What exactly are you saying?

1109
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:04,825
This administration is not going to allow...

1110
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:07,995
...public attention to be diverted
from all the good it's done...

1111
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:11,039
...by some kind of a witch hunt
in the Justice Department.

1112
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:13,584
l'm just telling you what the score is.

1113
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,961
lt's up to you to take care of him.

1114
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,258
Why would J. Edgar Hoover care
about what happens to Henri?

1115
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:24,761
Grow up. He doesn't care
about what happens to Henri.

1116
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,305
He cares about...

1117
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,141
...Alcatraz, the Justice Department...

1118
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,852
...Humson, the Administration.

1119
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:34,563
He can't have some kid from the P.D.'s--

1120
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,732
l'm not a public defender anymore.

1121
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,734
You know the point.

1122
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:43,197
The point is l'm trying to do what's right.
l'm talking about justice here.

1123
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:46,575
You're disgusted about what happened
on Alcatraz. So am l.

1124
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:50,245
But if you tear the whole system down...

1125
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,664
...what does that say about America?

1126
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:54,333
We're wrong.

1127
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:57,085
We can't be wrong.

1128
01:12:57,836 --> 01:13:02,257
The world is fighting right now
to preserve our system, our way of life.

1129
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:04,801
You can't attack it blindly.

1130
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:08,430
We're talking about one man here.
lt's not that big of a deal.

1131
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,934
-You're under surveillance.
-What?

1132
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:16,396
Everyone is watching you.
Tell me how you plan to continue.

1133
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:21,944
You have to realize, no one will talk.
Everyone has been gotten to.

1134
01:13:23,654 --> 01:13:25,030
l have somebody.

1135
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:26,740
Who?

1136
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,285
l can't tell you.

1137
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,163
So, now you don't trust me?

1138
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:35,332
You're my brother. l love you.

1139
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:37,417
l need your help.

1140
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,052
l can't do it. l'm sorry...

1141
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,720
...but l can't.

1142
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:51,515
l can't.

1143
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:06,613
James, as a consolation...

1144
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:10,033
...please don't put Humson on the stand.

1145
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:12,744
Why?

1146
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:16,123
Humson was handpicked by Hoover.

1147
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:20,085
lt would save a lot of embarrassment
if you were to avoid Humson.

1148
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:24,381
l'll think about it.

1149
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,217
Thank you.

1150
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:32,181
l'm sorry, Byron.

1151
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:48,989
Yeah?

1152
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,909
<i>Mr. Stamphill?</i>

1153
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,702
<i>This is James Stamphill.</i>

1154
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,914
<i>This is Derek Simpson.
Remember we talked before?</i>

1155
01:14:56,955 --> 01:15:00,626
<i>Right. Of course, I remember.
Have you made your decision?</i>

1156
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,590
<i>I've been thinking about what we were
talking about and I'd like to be a witness.</i>

1157
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:08,258
<i>Wonderful.</i>

1158
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:11,470
<i>You do understand you must testify
in court under oath...</i>

1159
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,056
<i>...about the brutality you witnessed
at Alcatraz.</i>

1160
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:15,307
<i>I know that.</i>

1161
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,935
<i>Particularly in reference to Henri Young.</i>

1162
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:20,646
<i>I know some things.</i>

1163
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,690
<i>Do you hold any sort of grudge...</i>

1164
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:26,276
<i>...against Warden Humson
or Associate Warden Glenn?</i>

1165
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,361
<i>No.</i>

1166
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:30,781
<i>I'll come over and we can speak in person.</i>

1167
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,908
<i>Yes. I'm in Chinatown.</i>

1168
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:37,246
<i>It's an alley called Scotland Court.
The number there is 964.</i>

1169
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:51,260
Mr. Simpson, are you in here?

1170
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,474
Mr. Simpson, are you all right?

1171
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,446
You all right?

1172
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,950
Do you still want to be a witness?

1173
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,839
Who's she?

1174
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:31,300
She's a court reporter.

1175
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:33,177
What happened to your face?

1176
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:36,180
My face had a little accident this morning.

1177
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,473
We need to get one more deposition...

1178
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:39,433
No.

1179
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:42,978
...regarding the beatings you received.
Your eye, your leg....

1180
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,774
Remember when you told me
you'd never been with a woman before?

1181
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:50,527
Henri, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Henri.

1182
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,112
Nice to meet you.

1183
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:55,908
You got about four minutes before
the next guard arrives, so you gotta hurry.

1184
01:16:56,033 --> 01:17:00,078
l can't leave the room. l'm just going
to be over here. l'll turn my back.

1185
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,372
We can get acquainted.

1186
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:11,423
Come on, honey, we don't have all night.

1187
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:13,717
Thanks, Jim.

1188
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,761
You're a good friend.

1189
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:18,514
Oh, boy.

1190
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:28,565
Thanks. Hi, Charlie.

1191
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,360
What's the story?

1192
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:34,446
The attorney and a reporter inside
with the prisoner.

1193
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:37,824
-ls he shackled?
-Yeah. Otherwise, it's pretty quiet.

1194
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:43,872
Sweetie...

1195
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:48,585
...you have to get it up first. That's like
sticking an oyster into a slot machine.

1196
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:50,087
Give me that.

1197
01:17:57,135 --> 01:17:58,595
-l can't.
-You can.

1198
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:00,472
Yeah, you can.

1199
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:02,516
l can't, sorry. l'm sorry.

1200
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:05,185
-Except for the $5 you owe me.
-For what?

1201
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:08,939
What, you didn't listen?
Louis knocks Nova out in the sixth round.

1202
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:10,691
That bum.

1203
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,693
Give me the money.

1204
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,278
-l can't.
-Yeah, you can.

1205
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,029
l can't. l can't.

1206
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:17,865
-You can.
-l can't!

1207
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,373
<i>Adíos, Charlie.</i>

1208
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:32,045
You know what?

1209
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:37,259
lt's gonna cost extra, you know.

1210
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:40,012
Just do what you have to do.

1211
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:15,422
l can't.

1212
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:18,884
l'm sorry.

1213
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:24,765
l can't.

1214
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:37,194
Hey, we only had a few minutes.

1215
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:40,656
You got another guy in the room.
That's okay.

1216
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,960
Shh, baby.

1217
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:02,010
Your Honor, the defense calls
Associate Warden, Mr. Milton Glenn.

1218
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:21,321
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

1219
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:23,532
-So help me God.
-You may be seated.

1220
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:38,839
As associate warden, you are responsible
for the day-to-day running of the prison?

1221
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,132
You could say that.

1222
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:42,843
Then you must be familiar
with the dungeons.

1223
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:44,970
l'm sure you've heard of them.

1224
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,848
Some prisoners refer
to the lower levels as dungeons.

1225
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:51,143
They refer to bread and water
as piss and punk.

1226
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:55,314
The dictionary definition of a dungeon is:
''A close, dark prison...

1227
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:57,900
''...or vault, commonly underground.''

1228
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:02,529
The walls of those cells are 6 feet by 9,
and the roof 5 to 6 feet tall.

1229
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:05,240
-Would you call that close?
-ln my opinion, no.

1230
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:08,410
-Are there any light fixtures?
-No, but there aren't any books.

1231
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:09,494
Your Honor...

1232
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:13,790
...the defense offers these photographs
as defense exhibits B, C, D, E and F.

1233
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:17,127
How much light is in these cells
with no window and the door closed?

1234
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:20,339
-Not much.
-How long was Henri held in such a cell?

1235
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,007
l don't know exactly.

1236
01:21:22,132 --> 01:21:25,385
Three years and two months!
l have the records, if you'd like to see.

1237
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:28,138
-That sounds right.
-Three years and two months.

1238
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:32,100
ln that time, how often was Henri Young
allowed outside for exercise?

1239
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:36,688
Mr. Stamphill, l do not believe that
the exercise time of an inmate is relevant.

1240
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,357
l do. Answer the question.

1241
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,275
-Objection!
-Objection overruled!

1242
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,152
Henri Young tried to escape.

1243
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:45,697
When a criminal escapes from prison,
he doesn't go job-hunting.

1244
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:49,368
He robs somebody or kills somebody.
We do all we can to discourage escape.

1245
01:21:49,493 --> 01:21:53,413
ln three years and two months, how often
was Henri allowed outside for exercise?

1246
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:56,625
-Men sentenced to Alcatraz--
-Answer the question!

1247
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:00,045
How often was he allowed
outside for exercise?

1248
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:03,382
-Objection! He's badgering the witness.
-Objection overruled.

1249
01:22:03,507 --> 01:22:05,926
Mr. Glenn, you will answer that question.

1250
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:08,971
Young man, l do not recall.

1251
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,973
You don't know?

1252
01:22:11,098 --> 01:22:15,143
Surely a half hour a year isn't
too difficult to recall, now, is it?

1253
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:18,522
-There is no place in my court for sarcasm.
-Sorry.

1254
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:21,108
l have here a list with 32 names on it.

1255
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:25,237
These are men who were prisoners
at Alcatraz during your tenure. Correct?

1256
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:27,573
l can't remember the name
of every prisoner.

1257
01:22:27,698 --> 01:22:31,660
l have committal papers with your
signature as well as the late Dr. Kiley's.

1258
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:33,704
This is defense exhibit G.

1259
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:38,876
All these men were taken off Alcatraz in
straitjackets and put in mental institutions.

1260
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,544
-ls that correct?
-Objection!

1261
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,129
The question is immaterial.

1262
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:46,925
lmmaterial? Your Honor, l'm saying in lay
terms that Alcatraz drives people insane.

1263
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:52,014
lt has already done so in 32 instances.
lf this is not true, the witness can say so.

1264
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:54,266
lf it is true, it is most material...

1265
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:57,311
...and the jury ought to be privy
to that knowledge.

1266
01:22:57,477 --> 01:22:58,937
Objection overruled.

1267
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:00,022
Thank you.

1268
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:01,106
Now...

1269
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:05,611
...is it not true that these men were taken
off Alcatraz in straightjackets...

1270
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:10,199
...and placed in mental institutions
and you and Dr. Kiley signed the papers?

1271
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:11,033
True.

1272
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:13,827
ls it not also true that of these 32 men...

1273
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:17,497
...28 of them had never before set foot
inside a mental institution?

1274
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:20,125
-l don't know.
-Would you like to see the records?

1275
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,044
l'll take your word for it.

1276
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:25,005
Here are men who came to Alcatraz
legally sane...

1277
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:29,051
...were subjected to the conditions
of Alcatraz, then deemed to be insane.

1278
01:23:29,134 --> 01:23:30,219
ls that correct?

1279
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:33,055
Yes, but you can't say
that one causes the other.

1280
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:36,892
lnsanity's not a virus, is it?
lt's not something we're all going to catch.

1281
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:39,645
Objection, the witness is not
a psychiatrist!

1282
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,230
Objection sustained.

1283
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:42,731
Mr. Stamphill...

1284
01:23:42,814 --> 01:23:46,026
...confine your questions to areas
of Mr. Glenn's expertise.

1285
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:49,738
Very well, Mr. Glenn's expertise!
Have you ever beaten a prisoner?

1286
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:51,240
No, that's illegal.

1287
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,116
-Not even when provoked?
-No!

1288
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,537
You've never hit, kicked,
used a blackjack or a razor?

1289
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:59,206
You've never punched a prisoner
in your entire career?

1290
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:01,291
-Objection, Your Honor!
-Sustained.

1291
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,460
Confine yourself to one question at a time.

1292
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:08,048
ls it not true you ordered two guards to
throw Henri down a steel flight of stairs?

1293
01:24:08,131 --> 01:24:10,467
That you smashed his face
with a blackjack?

1294
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:14,429
That you took a straight razor, sliced open
his ankle, hobbling him for life?

1295
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:15,973
Answer the question!

1296
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:16,807
Objection!

1297
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:20,769
-He testified he didn't beat any prisoners.
-He's testified to a lot of things.

1298
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:24,106
Are you aware that, in a federal court
system, perjury is a crime?

1299
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,400
-You could go to jail!
-Young is on trial!

1300
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:30,445
Mind you, young man, that Henri Young
is the one on trial here, not me!

1301
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:33,615
l am a public servant!
l am not the bad guy!

1302
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:37,661
l will not be treated the same way as this,
this lying, murdering...

1303
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:39,162
...two-time loser!

1304
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:40,998
Silence, Mr. Glenn!

1305
01:24:41,164 --> 01:24:45,210
Mr. Stamphill, you are perilously close
to contempt of this court!

1306
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:49,131
You will proceed with caution!
ls that understood?

1307
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,260
Temper, temper.

1308
01:24:56,513 --> 01:24:58,807
Would you care to withdraw
any testimony?

1309
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:02,477
You wouldn't want somebody to testify
to the contrary, would you?

1310
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,606
No. l would not withdraw any testimony...

1311
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:08,358
...no matter what Henri Young
has told you.

1312
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:11,820
l'm not talking about Henri Young.
Who would believe him?

1313
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:16,074
Mr. Simpson, did you ever beat
this man, Henri Young?

1314
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:18,118
Objection! This has no bearing.

1315
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:21,663
No bearing? Beatings have a bearing
on a man's state of mind.

1316
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:24,124
So does three years of darkness.

1317
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:28,295
Do we need to be psychologists to know
that? You know that. l know you do.

1318
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:29,630
Objection overruled.

1319
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,298
Thank you, Your Honor.

1320
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:34,927
<i>Did you ever beat Henri Young
with a blackjack?</i>

1321
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:35,969
<i>Yes.</i>

1322
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:39,014
<i>Did you ever throw Henri Young
down a steel flight of stairs?</i>

1323
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:39,890
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

1324
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,017
<i>-You were ordered to do this?
-Yes, sir.</i>

1325
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:43,685
<i>Tell us the name of the man...</i>

1326
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:46,688
...who was your superior who ordered you
to do these things.

1327
01:25:46,772 --> 01:25:47,856
Mr. Glenn.

1328
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:50,651
You never went to Warden Humson
about these matters?

1329
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:51,568
No, sir.

1330
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:55,864
Thank you very much. l won't ask where
you got your bruises. l already know.

1331
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:59,493
The prosecution would like to mark
for identification...

1332
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:02,204
...the employment records
of Mr. Derek Simpson.

1333
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,789
Do you recall...

1334
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:07,084
...being suspended on November 4, 1936...

1335
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,920
...and again on July 6, 1937?

1336
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:11,880
Yeah.

1337
01:26:12,005 --> 01:26:13,173
Speak up.

1338
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:15,008
Yes.

1339
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:20,472
ls it not a fact you were fired from your job
as a guard because you are a drunk?

1340
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,516
-Objection!
-That's not true!

1341
01:26:22,599 --> 01:26:23,392
Objection!

1342
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:24,977
-Overruled.
-Mr. Glenn...

1343
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,187
...wouldn't tolerate this in a prison.

1344
01:26:27,271 --> 01:26:29,898
lsn't it true, having cost you your job...

1345
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:33,110
...you would say anything
to get even with Mr. Glenn?

1346
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:36,905
<i>The jury will disregard
Mr. Simpson's testimony.</i>

1347
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,910
Good afternoon, Mr. Stamphill,
is everything all right?

1348
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:55,090
-Son of a bitch!
-What happened?

1349
01:26:55,174 --> 01:26:56,925
You know exactly! You set me up!

1350
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,218
What are you talking about?

1351
01:26:58,302 --> 01:27:00,304
You took Simpson's picture
off of my desk!

1352
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:03,557
They never would've known
to tear him down if you hadn't told them !

1353
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,726
Are you going to hit me now?

1354
01:27:05,976 --> 01:27:07,060
Go ahead.

1355
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:10,314
lt's about time you grew up
and were a man.

1356
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:16,695
You're my brother.

1357
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:18,989
You had me beaten up.

1358
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:21,450
That was not supposed to happen.

1359
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:24,453
Only Simpson. You walked in,
it was bad timing.

1360
01:27:24,578 --> 01:27:25,787
Bad timing?

1361
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:30,751
Humson will testify.

1362
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:33,629
Why, James?
Humson doesn't know anything!

1363
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:38,550
He runs three prisons. He has to know
something. Unless he's never there.

1364
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,473
Son of a bitch.

1365
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:50,646
He was never there.

1366
01:27:51,188 --> 01:27:52,272
Never there.

1367
01:27:52,356 --> 01:27:53,857
You never saw him?

1368
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:57,277
You'd hear about him visiting,
but l never saw him.

1369
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,990
Your own brother did that to you?
Your brother did that to you?

1370
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:04,243
Jesus, rich people are weird.

1371
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:10,332
You hear DiMaggio broke Keeler's record?
Forty-five straight games.

1372
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,210
Wouldn't it be great if he never stopped?

1373
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:15,254
Dock records would show his visits.

1374
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:19,007
Every trip is recorded. l had to sign in
myself that one time l went.

1375
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:20,926
-What?
-We're friends, huh?

1376
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:22,177
Yeah, sure.

1377
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:24,137
ls it over? l mean, you know?

1378
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:25,347
ls that all?

1379
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:28,684
Nothing more you're going to do
with the trial?

1380
01:28:29,059 --> 01:28:30,519
Thought you didn't care.

1381
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:31,937
No, l don't care.

1382
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:36,149
lt's just that as long as you got shit
to throw at them, we can keep talking.

1383
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:38,151
But when it's over, it's over.

1384
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:41,029
l'm not here to entertain you
until the executioner comes.

1385
01:28:41,113 --> 01:28:43,031
This trial isn't a game.

1386
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:51,123
lf l was on the outside, if there was...

1387
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:55,794
...a good fairy and she waved a wand
and l was on the outside...

1388
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:58,463
...you and me, would we be friends then?

1389
01:28:59,006 --> 01:28:59,965
Yes.

1390
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,676
No, no, no, we wouldn't.

1391
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:06,346
You wouldn't have nothing to do with me.
You know it.

1392
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:09,224
What l can't figure out is why. l mean...

1393
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:13,645
...we both ain't got nobody else
and we're the same age, sort of.

1394
01:29:14,605 --> 01:29:17,065
lf l'd have lived in your house...

1395
01:29:17,274 --> 01:29:20,485
...and they'd have switched us
when we was babies...

1396
01:29:21,445 --> 01:29:23,906
...l could have been just like you.

1397
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,074
lf they stuck you in the hole...

1398
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:29,912
...you could be sitting here...

1399
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:33,207
...like me, asking why we couldn't
be friends on the outside.

1400
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:35,292
You ever steal five bucks?

1401
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:39,880
Once.

1402
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:42,424
When l was a kid, from my...

1403
01:29:42,925 --> 01:29:44,635
...brother's wallet.

1404
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:46,845
What happened?

1405
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:51,600
He told me not to do it again.

1406
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:58,023
Why'd they put me in that hole
for three years?

1407
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:01,610
l could have been just like you.

1408
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:06,657
l'd just like to ask them, you know.

1409
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:22,923
<i>Raise your right hand.</i>

1410
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:27,803
<i>Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?</i>

1411
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:29,555
<i>So help me God.</i>

1412
01:30:29,972 --> 01:30:31,557
You may be seated.

1413
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:40,816
Warden Humson, in a book you wrote,
you refer to the convicts as your children.

1414
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:45,362
You liken your job to that of a parent,
providing for their physical needs...

1415
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,447
...and molding their character.

1416
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:49,324
Yes, l wrote that.

1417
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:52,035
l have a record of a prisoner
named Johnson...

1418
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,788
...who did a total of 500 days
in the lower cells.

1419
01:30:54,872 --> 01:30:56,498
The hole, the dungeon.

1420
01:30:57,291 --> 01:31:01,712
This was over a ten-year period for such
offenses as not finishing all his food...

1421
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:06,091
...having an extra pair of socks in his cell,
keeping an untidy cell...

1422
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:10,762
...smuggling food from the dining room,
crumbs, in fact, for a pet lizard.

1423
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:13,265
ls this what you mean
''molding character''?

1424
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:15,100
No, no, no.

1425
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:17,102
You're twisting things here.

1426
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:22,024
The isolation cells were simply a tool
of a temporary nature...

1427
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:25,944
...for extreme cases
within the general population.

1428
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:31,658
Moreover, you make it sound like
the prisoner did 1,500 days at one stretch...

1429
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:33,493
...for one infraction.

1430
01:31:34,578 --> 01:31:36,038
That's not true.

1431
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:39,082
Prisoners were held...

1432
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:41,210
...for 19 days at a time.

1433
01:31:42,336 --> 01:31:44,004
-That's all.
-That's all.

1434
01:31:45,088 --> 01:31:49,134
Perhaps you can tell me why Henri Young
did over 1,000 days in the dungeon?

1435
01:31:49,343 --> 01:31:51,720
Not 19 days, but 1,000 days...

1436
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:55,807
...in total darkness with only 30 minutes
of daylight a year.

1437
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:57,643
He tried to escape.

1438
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:02,439
You can't compare his offense with that
of a man who smuggled food to a lizard.

1439
01:32:02,606 --> 01:32:05,943
Was this the first time a sentence
of three years had been imposed?

1440
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:07,402
lt wasn't a sentence.

1441
01:32:07,486 --> 01:32:10,239
lt was an administrative decision
to place him there...

1442
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:12,783
...for an undetermined amount of time.

1443
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:17,246
Why not a time limit? Doesn't that seem
a little bit inhumane? No time limit.

1444
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:18,872
Put simply, no.

1445
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:23,043
While we strive to prevent crime...

1446
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:26,088
...what should we do with a man
who has committed it?

1447
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:29,967
We aim to make him his better self.

1448
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:32,302
His better self.

1449
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:35,931
l'm sure that Henri Young thanks you
for his better self.

1450
01:32:36,139 --> 01:32:40,269
lt's a fact you simply put Henri Young
in that dungeon and forgot all about him.

1451
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:42,271
Washed your hands of him.

1452
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:45,816
Henri wanted me to ask you, ''Why?''
Why would you do that, sir? Why?

1453
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:47,359
That's not true.

1454
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:48,694
Objection.

1455
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:51,613
l withdraw the question.
l apologize to the jury--

1456
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:53,949
lt's not necessary that you apologize.

1457
01:32:54,825 --> 01:32:57,703
Actually, Your Honor, it is.
l made a mistake.

1458
01:32:58,161 --> 01:33:02,124
The warden couldn't simply have washed
his hands of Henri Young...

1459
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:05,252
...because he had absolutely no idea
he was there.

1460
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:06,795
lsn't that true?

1461
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:10,757
You're never there. You permit Glenn
to run that prison any way he sees fit.

1462
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:14,761
l am there as much as l need to be.
l run three penal institutions.

1463
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:18,473
lt's impossible to know every detail
of every inmate.

1464
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:23,729
l have the Port Authority records that you
signed every time you went to Alcatraz.

1465
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:28,358
You went seven times in '38,
five in '39, ten in '40...

1466
01:33:28,692 --> 01:33:30,694
...and only twice so far this year.

1467
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:33,030
Twenty-four day trips in over 3-1 /2 years...

1468
01:33:33,155 --> 01:33:36,533
...while Henri Young was in that dungeon
over 1,000 days.

1469
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,869
Twenty-four out of 1,000 days.

1470
01:33:39,203 --> 01:33:41,538
That's how much you needed to be there?

1471
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:46,043
You knew nothing about a man who was
left to die in a dungeon for 3-1 /2 years.

1472
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:47,294
Absolutely nothing!

1473
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:50,756
ln fact, you have never even met
Henri Young, have you?

1474
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:55,511
Right now, in fact, is the first time
you have ever seen this man! Look at him !

1475
01:33:55,969 --> 01:33:58,472
That's him there! That's Henri Young!
Right there!

1476
01:33:58,597 --> 01:34:00,349
-He tried to escape.
-Yes, he did.

1477
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:04,561
But the fact, the cold, brutal fact is
that this man...

1478
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:07,356
...who had never,
never before in his entire life...

1479
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:10,150
...harmed or attempted to harm
another human being...

1480
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:11,818
...was now a murderer!

1481
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:13,445
That is a fact!

1482
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:15,697
-Yes, but he tried to escape.
-lt's a fact--

1483
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:20,786
You can't let them get away with this.
lf we let them, where would we be?

1484
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:25,123
-Should we let murderers roam free?
-Henri Young was not a murderer!

1485
01:34:25,499 --> 01:34:28,919
Henri Young was not a murderer
until Alcatraz got a hold of him !

1486
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:33,465
The prison runs under your guidelines,
so you created the murderer, didn't you?

1487
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:34,883
Didn't you?

1488
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:38,303
He tried to escape.

1489
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:43,016
That's the thing, you see.

1490
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:51,942
Do you have any further questions
for this witness?

1491
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:56,738
-No, Your Honor.
-The witness may step down.

1492
01:34:57,614 --> 01:34:59,241
But he tried to escape.

1493
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:04,538
<i>I'd been trained all my life for that day.
Control the witness, go for the kill.</i>

1494
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:06,832
<i>Win, victory.</i>

1495
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:10,127
<i>School prepared me well.</i>

1496
01:35:10,294 --> 01:35:12,504
<i>My brother, he had prepared me well.</i>

1497
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:15,841
<i>Years later, he and I would reconcile.</i>

1498
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:18,760
<i>Family's family, you know.</i>

1499
01:35:20,304 --> 01:35:22,139
<i>Mary congratulated me...</i>

1500
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:24,725
<i>...but we'd already begun to drift apart.</i>

1501
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:29,605
<i>When you only try to win,
you sometimes lose sight of the goal...</i>

1502
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,941
<i>...which should have always
remained Henri.</i>

1503
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:47,539
<i>The most you'll get is
second-degree murder.</i>

1504
01:35:47,831 --> 01:35:49,374
<i>Maybe manslaughter, ten years.</i>

1505
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:52,085
<i>If you get a recommendation
for clemency, you'll walk.</i>

1506
01:35:52,169 --> 01:35:55,464
-You have your whole life in front of you.
-Monday morning...

1507
01:35:55,797 --> 01:35:59,384
...go up to the judge and tell him
there's been a change of plan.

1508
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:01,887
l want you to change my plea to guilty.

1509
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:04,973
ls that a joke?

1510
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:06,558
Not to me, it's not.

1511
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:08,393
l'm not doing it.

1512
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:12,022
What have l been doing here?
Why have l been wasting my time?

1513
01:36:12,814 --> 01:36:14,691
l never thought we'd win.

1514
01:36:15,317 --> 01:36:17,277
l thought you wanted to fight.

1515
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:18,654
l just...

1516
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:20,656
...wanted a friend.

1517
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:22,407
l am your friend.

1518
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:25,202
No, you're not. lt's always about you.

1519
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:28,830
lt's never about me.
You don't understand.

1520
01:36:29,164 --> 01:36:32,334
l already lost and you just keep talking...

1521
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,420
...and talking and you never listen.

1522
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:39,842
You don't know what you're talking about.
You just don't know what it's like.

1523
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,218
What what's like?

1524
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:42,511
Alcatraz!

1525
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,474
Where do you think they'll send me
for those ten years you're talking about?

1526
01:36:47,558 --> 01:36:49,601
They'll send me back to Alcatraz!

1527
01:36:49,852 --> 01:36:52,104
When it's over, you'll be alive!

1528
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:53,272
l'm Henri!

1529
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:56,525
l'm the one that's got to do the time,
not you!

1530
01:36:56,984 --> 01:36:59,319
And l can't do it! l can't do it!

1531
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:01,530
l can't, all right?

1532
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,033
lt's not worth it.

1533
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:06,827
lt's not worth it.

1534
01:37:07,578 --> 01:37:09,663
Nothing's worth going back there.

1535
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:17,004
<i>Sixty-seven thousand fans
at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland...</i>

1536
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:21,967
<i>...watching to see if Joe DiMaggio can keep
his 56-game hitting streak alive.</i>

1537
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:26,180
<i>Jim Bank is on the mound,
count one and one, runner on first base.</i>

1538
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:29,474
<i>Here's the pitch. DiMaggio swings.</i>

1539
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:40,736
<i>It's a double play! DiMaggio's 56-game
hitting streak is stopped!</i>

1540
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:49,161
Mrs. Rosetta Dial?

1541
01:38:04,968 --> 01:38:06,470
Why are we in here?

1542
01:38:06,637 --> 01:38:09,681
Maybe there are some things
worth fighting for.

1543
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:17,689
Henri?

1544
01:38:18,649 --> 01:38:20,108
Do l know you?

1545
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:25,113
l'm Rosetta, Henri.

1546
01:38:26,657 --> 01:38:28,200
l'm your sister.

1547
01:38:38,502 --> 01:38:40,212
My baby's name is Henri.

1548
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:48,804
Mr. Stamphill says--

1549
01:38:49,012 --> 01:38:50,222
l was...

1550
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:54,226
...beginning to think...

1551
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,730
...that you wasn't real. That l...

1552
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:01,733
...made you up in my mind.

1553
01:39:05,028 --> 01:39:06,655
l want you to come--

1554
01:39:08,532 --> 01:39:10,993
l want you to tell Jim that l appreciate...

1555
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:13,579
...him bringing you down here
and knowing...

1556
01:39:13,787 --> 01:39:15,664
...that you turned out okay.

1557
01:39:16,623 --> 01:39:20,544
That means a lot. l want you to tell him,
come Monday morning...

1558
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:24,673
...he's going to plead me guilty
just like l said.

1559
01:39:28,552 --> 01:39:30,179
l wish l wasn't...

1560
01:39:30,554 --> 01:39:32,681
...so scared of them, Rosetta.

1561
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:37,477
l wish to God l wasn't.

1562
01:39:55,662 --> 01:39:57,581
You take care of yourself now.

1563
01:42:01,205 --> 01:42:03,207
<i>You may call your next witness.</i>

1564
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:05,501
Just a second.

1565
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:07,961
l'm your friend.

1566
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,756
On the outside, l'd be lucky
to consider you my friend.

1567
01:42:10,881 --> 01:42:12,591
So l'm not going to kill you.

1568
01:42:12,716 --> 01:42:16,303
-Are you going to call a witness today?
-Yes, Your Honor.

1569
01:42:17,554 --> 01:42:21,350
lf you want to change your plea,
you go do it. l'm not going to do it.

1570
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:24,269
-l want you to plead me guilty.
-l don't think you are.

1571
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:25,854
-Doesn't matter.
-Does to me.

1572
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:28,857
Counselor, l am very close to finding you
in contempt of--

1573
01:42:28,941 --> 01:42:31,193
The defense calls Mr. Henri Young.

1574
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:32,402
No!

1575
01:42:32,736 --> 01:42:34,196
He just lost the case.

1576
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:36,240
You go up and change your plea.

1577
01:42:36,448 --> 01:42:38,909
l repeat, l'm not going to do it for you.

1578
01:42:40,744 --> 01:42:41,745
Counselor--

1579
01:42:42,412 --> 01:42:43,747
He's coming.

1580
01:42:45,457 --> 01:42:46,750
Go ahead, tell them.

1581
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:57,386
Tell them, not me.

1582
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:03,976
Better ask the right questions.

1583
01:43:04,101 --> 01:43:06,562
-l'll ask what l want.
-l'll answer what l want.

1584
01:43:06,687 --> 01:43:08,063
-Fine.
-Fine.

1585
01:43:12,484 --> 01:43:14,736
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.

1586
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:20,993
Stand up.

1587
01:43:21,451 --> 01:43:23,203
Put your hand on the Bible.

1588
01:43:26,957 --> 01:43:31,086
Do you swear to tell the truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1589
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:32,421
So help me God.

1590
01:43:32,504 --> 01:43:33,797
State your name.

1591
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:35,382
Henri Young.

1592
01:43:35,632 --> 01:43:36,800
Be seated.

1593
01:43:37,634 --> 01:43:38,760
Your Honor--

1594
01:43:38,844 --> 01:43:40,596
Wait until l've asked a question!

1595
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:43,140
-l haven't asked you yet.
-He's trying to trick me.

1596
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:46,852
Please instruct the witness to remain silent
until l ask a question...

1597
01:43:46,977 --> 01:43:49,104
...and only answer the question l ask.

1598
01:43:49,188 --> 01:43:50,314
He's your witness.

1599
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:51,899
He won't listen.

1600
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:53,567
He's trying to trick me!

1601
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:54,943
Silence, Mr. Young.

1602
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:59,448
Here's the way it works.
Mr. Stamphill will ask you a question...

1603
01:43:59,656 --> 01:44:01,450
...and you answer that question.

1604
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:05,996
However, Mr. Stamphill cannot coerce you
into testifying against yourself.

1605
01:44:06,205 --> 01:44:07,748
You do understand that?

1606
01:44:07,873 --> 01:44:09,416
Yeah, l just want to--

1607
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:13,921
Did we have a conversation in which
you said you wish to change your plea--

1608
01:44:15,214 --> 01:44:18,842
You will wait until l have finished
instructing the witness.

1609
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,261
lt's okay. l wanted him to ask that.

1610
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:23,055
lt is not okay.

1611
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:28,435
And l do not need you to tell me
what is or is not okay.

1612
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,939
ln this courtroom,
l am the one who decides...

1613
01:44:32,022 --> 01:44:34,191
...what is or is not okay.

1614
01:44:35,275 --> 01:44:35,984
Okay?

1615
01:44:37,194 --> 01:44:37,819
Yes.

1616
01:44:38,028 --> 01:44:39,488
Thank you very much.

1617
01:44:42,032 --> 01:44:43,992
Counselors, approach the bench.

1618
01:44:48,205 --> 01:44:51,166
Do you mind telling me
what the hell is going on here?

1619
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,167
l'm trying--

1620
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,504
Your own defendant is looking to me
to protect him from you.

1621
01:44:55,629 --> 01:44:56,922
So what's going on?

1622
01:44:57,047 --> 01:44:59,466
l know it seems very strange but--

1623
01:44:59,716 --> 01:45:03,512
ln my opinion, you're an idiot to put him
on the stand for any reason.

1624
01:45:03,595 --> 01:45:06,014
You're asking him to testify
against himself.

1625
01:45:06,431 --> 01:45:10,269
lt doesn't seem to make sense,
but the prosecution isn't objecting so--

1626
01:45:10,394 --> 01:45:12,020
No, l'm not. Let him continue.

1627
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:13,397
Shut up.

1628
01:45:14,898 --> 01:45:18,235
Enough damage has been done.
l can't make it any worse.

1629
01:45:18,443 --> 01:45:19,653
Yes, you can.

1630
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:23,740
All right. But you're on a very short leash.

1631
01:45:24,783 --> 01:45:26,410
A very short leash.

1632
01:45:26,743 --> 01:45:29,705
l will throw you in jail
for contempt myself.

1633
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:31,582
Now...

1634
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:34,418
...let's get this goddamn show on the road.

1635
01:45:38,046 --> 01:45:39,756
l think you're doing a great job.

1636
01:45:42,092 --> 01:45:44,428
Mr. Young, stop playing with that!

1637
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:51,852
Now, do you or do you not wish
to continue testifying, Mr. Young?

1638
01:45:52,644 --> 01:45:55,105
lt's okay. He asked me the right question.

1639
01:45:55,939 --> 01:45:57,941
Counselor, you may proceed.

1640
01:46:01,153 --> 01:46:04,781
Mr. Young, did you and l not have
a conversation last Friday...

1641
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:08,118
...in which you told me you wished
to change your plea to guilty?

1642
01:46:08,493 --> 01:46:10,078
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1643
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:14,249
l want to change my plea.
That's what l said.

1644
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:18,170
l'm going to ask you the single
most important question l can ask you.

1645
01:46:18,295 --> 01:46:20,088
lt's what this whole trial's about.

1646
01:46:20,631 --> 01:46:23,467
Are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

1647
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:26,178
l want to change my plea to guilty.
l said that.

1648
01:46:26,303 --> 01:46:29,431
l didn't ask what you wanted to do.
l asked if you are guilty.

1649
01:46:29,556 --> 01:46:30,349
Objection!

1650
01:46:30,474 --> 01:46:32,184
He's badgering the witness.

1651
01:46:32,309 --> 01:46:35,103
-He's my witness, for Christ's sake!
-l'm not your nothing!

1652
01:46:35,187 --> 01:46:38,232
lf the accused wants to enter
a plea of guilty--

1653
01:46:38,649 --> 01:46:42,486
Silence! Mr. Stamphill,
you are skating on very thin ice here.

1654
01:46:43,487 --> 01:46:46,615
Maybe, Your Honor,
but l'd like to get to the other side.

1655
01:46:48,492 --> 01:46:50,619
Very well. You may proceed...

1656
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:52,788
...at your own peril.

1657
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:53,789
Thank you.

1658
01:46:57,501 --> 01:46:59,795
Let me take this one step at a time.

1659
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:05,509
We had a conversation in which
l told you l felt...

1660
01:47:05,634 --> 01:47:07,594
...with the way the trial was going...

1661
01:47:07,678 --> 01:47:12,099
...the most you'd have to face, more than
likely, would be another ten years or less.

1662
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:14,810
-l don't care--
-Ten years, that's what l said.

1663
01:47:14,893 --> 01:47:16,353
Yeah, yeah, but--

1664
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:18,313
Did you say to me...

1665
01:47:18,522 --> 01:47:21,692
...you were the guy who had to do
the time, not me?

1666
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:25,070
That they'd stick you back in Alcatraz
for those ten years, right?

1667
01:47:25,195 --> 01:47:28,198
That's what l told you.
Why are you doing this to me?

1668
01:47:28,407 --> 01:47:32,202
Because if you change your plea to guilty,
they will execute you.

1669
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:34,538
-You will die!
-So fucking what?

1670
01:47:34,872 --> 01:47:36,999
l'd rather die than go back there!

1671
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:51,013
What'd you say?

1672
01:47:51,221 --> 01:47:52,181
l said...

1673
01:47:53,891 --> 01:47:57,311
...l'd rather die than go back there!
Can't you understand that?

1674
01:47:58,395 --> 01:47:59,521
Why, Henri?

1675
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,398
Why do you want to die?

1676
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:03,233
Because....

1677
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:06,361
Because l'm...

1678
01:48:08,405 --> 01:48:09,740
...scared of them.

1679
01:48:10,616 --> 01:48:13,035
l'm scared to go back there. l'm scared.

1680
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:15,746
l'm scared. l'm scared.

1681
01:48:15,954 --> 01:48:19,166
-Objection! He's finished--
-l haven't finished anything!

1682
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:21,418
Henri, look at me.

1683
01:48:21,793 --> 01:48:23,879
Henri, look at me. Look at me.

1684
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:27,925
You were right. You were right,
l was wrong. l'm sorry.

1685
01:48:28,133 --> 01:48:31,136
l'm just talking to you right now.
Not the judge or the jury.

1686
01:48:31,261 --> 01:48:34,389
lf you want to die, we'll back you up.
But l swear to God...

1687
01:48:34,473 --> 01:48:37,893
...l'll fight these bastards
so they'll never do this to anyone again.

1688
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:40,020
You're not going to die for nothing!

1689
01:48:40,145 --> 01:48:41,605
The choice is yours.

1690
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,566
What do you want to do?

1691
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,241
l want to stop being afraid.

1692
01:49:00,624 --> 01:49:01,625
All right.

1693
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:38,120
Henri Young...

1694
01:49:40,664 --> 01:49:43,542
...are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

1695
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:06,148
l was the weapon...

1696
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:09,568
...but l ain't no killer.

1697
01:50:12,237 --> 01:50:13,864
They're the murderers.

1698
01:50:25,209 --> 01:50:27,753
Bailiff, you may remove the prisoner.

1699
01:50:29,671 --> 01:50:32,049
Escort the prisoner to the holding room.

1700
01:50:59,451 --> 01:51:03,705
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you have received your instructions.</i>

1701
01:51:03,956 --> 01:51:07,876
<i>You may find the defendant guilty
of involuntary manslaughter...</i>

1702
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:11,338
<i>...which carries with it a maximum penalty
of three years...</i>

1703
01:51:11,713 --> 01:51:14,341
<i>...in which case the defendant
will be remanded...</i>

1704
01:51:14,424 --> 01:51:17,052
<i>...to the custody of the warden of Alcatraz.</i>

1705
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:22,099
<i>Or you may find the defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree.</i>

1706
01:51:23,267 --> 01:51:25,727
<i>Without a recommendation for mercy...</i>

1707
01:51:25,811 --> 01:51:28,897
<i>...that verdict will carry with it
a sentence of death.</i>

1708
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:20,449
This court is now in session.

1709
01:52:21,491 --> 01:52:24,620
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
how do you find?

1710
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:27,164
The defendant will rise.

1711
01:52:29,499 --> 01:52:32,503
We, the jury,
find the defendant, Henri Young...

1712
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:35,172
...not guilty of first-degree murder...

1713
01:52:35,506 --> 01:52:38,050
...and guilty only
of involuntary manslaughter.

1714
01:52:38,175 --> 01:52:39,635
Order! Order!

1715
01:52:40,177 --> 01:52:43,472
We would like permission to address
the court, if possible.

1716
01:52:44,181 --> 01:52:45,349
Very well.

1717
01:52:45,557 --> 01:52:49,811
We have this day signed a petition
which l would like to read to the court.

1718
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:55,150
''We would like the following to be read
into the record of this proceeding.

1719
01:52:55,234 --> 01:52:58,487
''Though we know it will have
no legal or binding effect...

1720
01:52:59,363 --> 01:53:02,199
''...we'd hope that it will have
a moral effect.

1721
01:53:03,534 --> 01:53:07,788
''We, the members of the jury,
recommend the immediate investigation...

1722
01:53:07,871 --> 01:53:10,249
''...by the proper federal authorities...

1723
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:13,502
''...of the federal penitentiary
known as Alcatraz.

1724
01:53:14,253 --> 01:53:17,005
''We find this institution, its wardens...

1725
01:53:17,548 --> 01:53:20,968
''...and associate warden,
guilty of crimes against humanity.''

1726
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:23,887
Thank you.

1727
01:53:24,096 --> 01:53:25,639
The jury is dismissed.

1728
01:53:25,764 --> 01:53:27,724
This trial is concluded.

1729
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:30,811
All rise. The defendant is remanded
to the custody of Alcatraz.

1730
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:35,440
<i>News from San Francisco.
The Young trial concludes.</i>

1731
01:53:35,774 --> 01:53:38,402
<i>The Rock will be investigated
as Young is vindicated...</i>

1732
01:53:38,527 --> 01:53:41,071
<i>...by a verdict of involuntary manslaughter.</i>

1733
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:44,116
<i>As I walked out of the courtroom
that day...</i>

1734
01:53:44,449 --> 01:53:48,412
<i>...I did not fully realize how much
Henri and I had actually accomplished.</i>

1735
01:53:48,579 --> 01:53:50,414
<i>It all just happened so fast.</i>

1736
01:53:51,748 --> 01:53:53,876
l'll to be up to see you as often as l can.

1737
01:53:54,001 --> 01:53:56,920
Then you can bring that Blanche back
for a second shot.

1738
01:53:57,129 --> 01:53:58,881
l'll see what l can do.

1739
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:00,382
No place like home.

1740
01:54:00,465 --> 01:54:01,925
Henri, it's not over.

1741
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:06,263
l'm going to appeal to have you moved
to another prison.

1742
01:54:06,471 --> 01:54:09,474
l'm going to file motions to have
your original case reopened.

1743
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,060
Henri and Jim, together again, huh?

1744
01:54:12,269 --> 01:54:14,646
That's right. Henri and Jim,
together again.

1745
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:17,316
Henri and Jim, together again.

1746
01:54:18,275 --> 01:54:19,735
l won, didn't l?

1747
01:54:19,902 --> 01:54:22,154
l mean, l really did something.

1748
01:54:22,529 --> 01:54:23,530
l won!

1749
01:54:24,448 --> 01:54:26,241
That's right, you won.

1750
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:31,121
How many games was
DiMaggio's hitting streak?

1751
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:32,664
Fifty-four?

1752
01:54:32,915 --> 01:54:34,416
No, l got you.

1753
01:54:34,625 --> 01:54:36,376
lt was 56, wasn't it?

1754
01:54:40,339 --> 01:54:41,798
l'll see you soon!

1755
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:44,843
Take care of yourself.

1756
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:03,862
<i>The definition of victory is:</i>

1757
01:55:04,488 --> 01:55:06,949
<i>''Success in any contest or struggle.</i>

1758
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,452
<i>''An engagement ending in triumph.''</i>

1759
01:55:20,712 --> 01:55:24,258
<i>That was to be the last time
I was to see Henri Young alive.</i>

1760
01:55:25,133 --> 01:55:29,179
<i>Before the court date was set for
an appeal, his body was found in a cell.</i>

1761
01:55:30,055 --> 01:55:33,308
<i>He laid beneath a single word
he had scrawled with a rock:</i>

1762
01:55:34,685 --> 01:55:35,811
<i>''Victory.''</i>

1763
01:55:37,312 --> 01:55:40,190
<i>Henri Young had taught me
the meaning of the word.</i>

1764
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:54,788
<i>He was the only man that I have known
who gave more than he asked.</i>

1765
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,332
<i>All that he ever wanted was a friend.</i>

1766
01:55:57,916 --> 01:56:01,712
<i>I will always remember him
as one of the best friends I have ever had.</i>

1767
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:06,133
<i>Unlike many men that live much longer...</i>

1768
01:56:06,717 --> 01:56:08,844
<i>...Henri Young did not die in vain.</i>

1769
01:56:10,429 --> 01:56:12,556
<i>In the end, he was not afraid.</i>

1770
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:15,893
<i>He lived and he died in triumph.</i>

1771
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:20,731
<i>If only we could all do that.</i>

1772
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:31,700
Welcome home.

1773
01:56:33,577 --> 01:56:35,037
l've missed you.

1774
01:56:44,046 --> 01:56:45,589
You can beat me...

1775
01:56:46,048 --> 01:56:49,718
...you can put me back in that hole,
whatever you want to do.

1776
01:56:51,053 --> 01:56:52,763
lt doesn't matter to me.

1777
01:56:54,765 --> 01:56:55,724
Action:

1778
01:56:56,808 --> 01:56:57,935
l won.

1779
01:56:59,228 --> 01:57:00,479
Reaction:

1780
01:57:01,355 --> 01:57:03,690
You can't ever take that away from me.

1781
01:57:19,248 --> 01:57:21,041
Take him to the hole!

1782
01:57:42,646 --> 01:57:46,483
<i>Charles Dickens once said
that solitary confinement was inhumane.</i>

1783
01:57:47,109 --> 01:57:50,112
<i>Seven months later,
the Supreme Court agreed.</i>

1784
01:57:50,654 --> 01:57:54,950
<i>And as a result of the facts brought out
in the trial of The People vs. Young...</i>

1785
01:57:55,033 --> 01:57:57,953
<i>...the dungeons of Alcatraz
were closed forever.</i>

1786
01:57:58,370 --> 01:58:01,999
<i>Associate Warden Glenn was brought up
on charges of mistreatment.</i>

1787
01:58:02,374 --> 01:58:06,170
<i>He was found guilty. He would never work
in the penal system again.</i>

1788
01:58:07,087 --> 01:58:09,047
<i>I remained in private practice.</i>

1789
01:58:10,048 --> 01:58:11,884
<i>I also became a baseball fan.</i>

1790
01:58:13,844 --> 01:58:15,345
<i>You did it, Henri.</i>
