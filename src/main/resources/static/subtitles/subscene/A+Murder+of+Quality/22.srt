1
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,619
People ought to be
ashamed of themselves.

2
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:01,121
Kicking up
all that racket

3
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:02,622
at this time of night.

4
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
What is it?

5
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,646
Is it a fire?

6
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:31,901
Well, why can't th
ey knock quietly?

7
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:35,188
Oh, blast it.
We never...

8
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,740
it's about
3 doors down.

9
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,745
That's where
diana baring is staying.

10
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,113
I say,

11
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:46,115
there's a policeman
coming over i think.

12
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,116
Where?

13
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,618
Well, just coming
around the corner.

14
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:49,619
What?

15
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,120
Well, that's funny
. i could've sworn.

16
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:52,121
No, you're right.
Look. There he is.

17
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,123
Coming down the side
of the road.

18
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,127
I say!

19
00:02:58,162 --> 00:02:59,629
That's
druce knocking.

20
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,631
Looks as though
he's tight again.

21
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,633
Here. Here.
Where's my shoes?

22
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,518
I better get down.

23
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,353
Aye. I'm on my way.

24
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,894
What, at this
time of night?

25
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,899
My wife edna!

26
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:24,404
...with diana baring.

27
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:25,905
She's a...

28
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:28,408
Yeah, wait for me.
I'm coming.

29
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,909
I can't stop now.

30
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,411
I gotta go see what's
the matter with druce.

31
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:32,412
Ohh.

32
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,631
Say, what's the matter,
mr. Druce? Anything wrong?

33
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,632
My wife.

34
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,134
Will you please
take this man away?

35
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,136
Come along now, druce,
there's a good fellow.

36
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,087
No. Stop it.

37
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:43,590
There.

38
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,091
Open this door,
will you?!

39
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,092
Open this door!

40
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:47,093
Hold on.
One second.

41
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:47,977
Open the door.

42
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:48,978
Come on.

43
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,481
Let go. Now,
wait a minute now.

44
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:52,982
I can't wait to see
what's going to happen.

45
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:53,983
Open the door, please!

46
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,985
Open the door
for the love of god!

47
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,238
Open the door,
for god's sake.

48
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,449
One of you run
down to the station

49
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,951
and ask the inspector
to come along.

50
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,235
Tell him it's serious.

51
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,206
Is this woman
a lodger of yours?

52
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,492
No, but miss baring is.

53
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,045
And she had mrs. Druce
to supper with her tonight.

54
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,547
As a matter of fact,
it was about...

55
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,049
well, you see,
mr. Constable,

56
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,551
both these ladies are...

57
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,052
i mean, were...

58
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,554
you see, we're all
members of the company

59
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,556
that's playing at the theatre
royale this week.

60
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:08,558
And as i was leaving
the theatre,

61
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:10,059
you see i'm
the stage manager,

62
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,844
and mr. Druce here,
he's the general manager.

63
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:13,930
Well, you see, when i left
the theatre tonight,

64
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,431
i was invited
to join them.

65
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,933
Wait. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

66
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,434
One at a time, please.

67
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:19,936
They killed
you, edna.

68
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,937
They killed you.

69
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:21,938
Tell me, darling.

70
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,941
Who, darling?
Did she do it?

71
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:32,448
You always
hated edna.

72
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,451
Thought yourself
too good for us...

73
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:39,956
with your high and
mighty ladylike ways.

74
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,457
Now, pull yourself
together.

75
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,962
Ohh! Leave me alone.

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,766
Is there any
brandy in the house?

77
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,772
You'll find some brandy
in the flask on the table.

78
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,274
I was just giving
some to edna when...

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,276
when...

80
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,779
i can't think.

81
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,781
I can't remember.

82
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,789
Well, there's none
there. It's empty.

83
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:14,791
I'll run back
and fetch some.

84
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:17,293
Perhaps you'd like
a cup of tea, dear.

85
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,295
It'll warm you up.

86
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,797
T.
I'll go and make i

87
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,218
i'll give you
a hand, dear.

88
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,642
Shall i light
this gas, dear?

89
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:33,643
Please, dear.

90
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,144
It's still hot.

91
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,647
It only wants
a drop more in it.

92
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,149
Light the stove,
will you, dear?

93
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,152
I, uh...

94
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,153
Uh!

95
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:47,156
I suppose mrs. Druce
really is dead,

96
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:50,159
you know, uh...

97
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,662
you know, diana
never did get on well

98
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,163
with poor edna druce,

99
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,665
and i know for a fact

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,667
that they hadn't
been on speaking terms

101
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,168
for the last 7 weeks.

102
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:02,171
Miss diana said
nothing to me about it.

103
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:05,675
Well, it's a fact. You
can take it from me.

104
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,685
I don't believe
she could have done it,

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,188
though there's no denying
she is headstrong.

106
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,189
I should say so.

107
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,191
Why, she gave
in her notice

108
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,192
the other day
over edna.

109
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,194
Who, miss diana?

110
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,697
Yes, but, uh...

111
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:30,199
jinx didn't want
to lose her,

112
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,201
so edna would've
been glad enough

113
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,202
to see her go.

114
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,705
Then suddenly...

115
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,708
suddenly, last night,
she changed,

116
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,210
asked if they
could make it up.

117
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,712
Diana was puzzled

118
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,714
but asked her
home to supper.

119
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,716
Now, i can't
help feeling now

120
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,217
that she had
some reason

121
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,219
for getting
diana here alone.

122
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,722
Of course,
perhaps it's been...

123
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,223
hot stuff like she is,

124
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,725
she thought
one of her men

125
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,226
was getting too keen
on diana baring

126
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,229
and wanted her
out of the way.

127
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:02,732
What kind of tea
did you use, dear?

128
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,735
Oh, my dear, i've tried
so many kinds,

129
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,737
i don't really remember
which this is.

130
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:09,739
I'll get the door, right?

131
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:10,740
Would you mind...

132
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:13,242
open the door, yes,
if you don't mind.

133
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,250
Here. I say,
i've just made tea.

134
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:22,251
That's all right, ma.

135
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,754
We'll get some down
at the station.

136
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,820
Third act
beginners, please.

137
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,322
Your call,
miss baring.

138
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,840
That's
miss baring's understudy.

139
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,842
There you are, see?
Going on now.

140
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,344
You are
answering the door?

141
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,213
Answer the door?
Of course.

142
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,598
You know that.

143
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,600
Well, i don't know
where we shall go.

144
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,101
Oh, tom. Tom.

145
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,603
Just a minute.

146
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,605
The inspector would like
to have a word with you.

147
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,607
This is mr. Tom druid,
inspector.

148
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:08,608
How do you do, sir?

149
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:10,109
It's about the
murder, mr. Drake.

150
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,611
Now, there are
one or two points

151
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:12,612
we're clearing up.

152
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,614
I suppose you didn'’
’t happen to see

153
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,115
mrs. Druce
and miss baring

154
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,117
leave the theatre
together last night.

155
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
Yes, i did.

156
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,126
As a matter of fact,

157
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,129
i remarked to fane, our
leading man, about it.

158
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,631
He saw them,
as well, you know.

159
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,132
Why? Is it very unusual?

160
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,134
Unusual? I should say so.

161
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,636
Unusual?

162
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,137
It's an absolute miracle.

163
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,640
As i was saying to my wife,

164
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:43,142
i said, "annie, we met... "

165
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,645
hold on, old boy. My cue.

166
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,749
Say, which of
the 2 women is this?

167
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,250
Mrs. Druid?

168
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,753
Oh. Ha ha ha.

169
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:11,754
Now, i'm afraid

170
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,706
you're unlucky this time,
inspector.

171
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,709
This is handel fane,
100% he-woman.

172
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,712
Mr. Fane's
our leading man.

173
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,713
I assure you,
inspector,

174
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,214
i'm not
the other woman

175
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,215
in the case.

176
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,216
I know that, mr. Fane,

177
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,718
but i understand you saw

178
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,219
the 2 women together
last night.

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,722
Yes, just before
i left the theatre,

180
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,724
then i went straight
to my rooms.

181
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,725
Alone?

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,728
Yes. Well, ion stewart
came with me.

183
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,230
He came and he wanted to
borrow some cigarettes.

184
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,233
He'd lost his case
or something,

185
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,235
and then i went
straight to bed.

186
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,237
Say, excuse me, i'm on

187
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,739
Reginald, darling,

188
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,208
has that cat gone yet?

189
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,212
Ooh, it's you,
cousin yettie.

190
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:57,216
Don't you dare to try
to run away from me.

191
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,719
Come here when
i speak to you.

192
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:02,722
No, no, you don't.

193
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:05,224
That's the bathroom.

194
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,226
Come here,

195
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:11,230
or are you afraid
of a poor, weak woman?

196
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,732
He promised
to meet, dear.

197
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,522
N?
Say, who's that ma

198
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,023
oh, that's
our heavy lead.

199
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:23,526
lon stewart.
Very sound actor.

200
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:26,028
Is he married?

201
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:27,413
How did he get on
with the prisoner?

202
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,914
Excuse me, inspector.

203
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,426
Say, how
did he get on

204
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:41,927
with the prisoner
miss baring?

205
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,929
So-so, you know?

206
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,432
Was he popular
with the ladies?

207
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,434
You talking
about the jerk?

208
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:51,437
He's a bit too popular
if you ask me.

209
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:52,938
Please, if you could
call her a lady.

210
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,440
Shh. Now,
doucie, remember,

211
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,441
she's only just dead.

212
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:56,942
Oh, all right,
all right.

213
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,944
I've never heard yet
that telling the truth

214
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,447
was a disgrace.
Only been one year

215
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:02,948
about edna
and stewart anyhow.

216
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,950
And the way i take it,

217
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,452
mr. Stewart
and mrs. Druce...

218
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,953
excuse me. My line.

219
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,457
Oh! Don't bother
to show me through.

220
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,459
I know my way.

221
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:16,462
This is not the first
time, reginald.

222
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:17,463
Everything's
going splendid.

223
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,465
Well, perhaps
i ought not to say

224
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,966
edna and stewart
like that.

225
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,968
But, ted, you know
what edna was like,

226
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,471
anyone she liked
had to be wrote in.

227
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:27,473
I can't wait
any longer.

228
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,641
Quick! In here!

229
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,928
Excuse me
a minute, inspector.

230
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,930
Shan't be long.
There's a quick change.

231
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,432
How do you do?

232
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,933
No, i'm sorry.
He's not here.

233
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,435
What have
they done with her?

234
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,436
Who, miss baring?

235
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,938
Why, she's down at
the station, i expect.

236
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:44,440
Did she say anything,
do you know?

237
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:45,941
Is there anything
i can do?

238
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:47,943
Markham, you don't
really think

239
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:49,445
she's done it, do you?

240
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,946
Why have
they arrested her?

241
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,948
Saw it with me own eyes.

242
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,951
She was with the poker
in her hand

243
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:57,953
just by her side anyway.
Blood. Covered with blood.

244
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:58,954
Oh. Don't.

245
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:00,456
Why, what's
the matter with you?

246
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,458
Blood always makes
me feel sick,

247
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,460
even the mention
of it.

248
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,462
Well, that's all right.
Here's your helmet.

249
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:07,463
Ready?

250
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:08,464
Yeah.

251
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,475
Yeah.
Hurry up, markham.

252
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,477
There you are.

253
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:22,978
Ok?

254
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:23,979
Yeah.

255
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,985
Yeah. Why not?

256
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,565
Members of the jury,

257
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,769
diana baring is indicted
and stands charge

258
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,272
with the willful murder
of edna druce.

259
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,273
For this indictment,

260
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,242
she has pleaded
not guilty.

261
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,243
It is your duty
to inquire

262
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,280
whether she
is guilty or not.

263
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,083
I need not remind you

264
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,586
that in the eyes
of the law,

265
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:24,373
men and women are equal.

266
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:27,876
The crime of murder
in england, at least,

267
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:31,380
is judged dispassionately.

268
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:36,385
Neither beauty
nor youth nor provocation

269
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,387
can mitigate...

270
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:40,889
she gave me
the strangest look.

271
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:43,392
Half-surprised...

272
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:45,394
and half-angry.

273
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,396
And she said,

274
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:49,898
how dare you!

275
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,401
And i don't
remember anymore.

276
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,405
I just don't remember.

277
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,544
Whatever i did...

278
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,048
must have happened when
i was not conscious of myself.

279
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,552
That's all i can say.

280
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:14,340
Our defense is
a complete denial

281
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,342
of all responsibility.

282
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:17,843
E
you've been able to observ

283
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,845
the behavior of the prisoner
in the dock...

284
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,847
and in the witness box.

285
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,351
My learned friend has
referred to her behavior

286
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:27,353
as hardened.

287
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,355
Gentlemen and ladies
of the jury,

288
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,857
is there anything so hardy

289
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:34,860
as the behavior
of sheer innocence?

290
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,864
If you're convince
d that the story

291
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,866
of the defense
represents the facts

292
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,867
of the case,

293
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,870
it is your duty to
discharge the accused.

294
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,872
I shall like
to remind you

295
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,875
that truth is often
stranger than fiction.

296
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,377
If, on the other hand,

297
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:53,379
you are convinced
that the evidence

298
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:56,382
is indeed fiction,
then i must tell you

299
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,384
in the words
of the counsel

300
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,885
of the prosecution

301
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,388
that neither
youth nor beauty

302
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:05,891
nor provocation
can be held to mitigate

303
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:08,777
the crime of murder.

304
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:13,232
Go and consider the
facts for yourselves.

305
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,084
Well, uh, ladies
and gentlemen,

306
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,086
We can't talk standing

307
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,839
would you ladies like
to sit together?

308
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:38,340
Anyway...

309
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,278
Why, i say,
may we look?

310
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,781
Yes. I don't
see why not.

311
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,784
That is, if the ladies
haven't any objection.

312
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,670
No. Not at all.

313
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,508
Now, i think
the best thing to do...

314
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:13,509
if you agree...

315
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:16,512
is to allow me to go over
the broad facts of the case.

316
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,514
Because after all,
i think it's pretty clear

317
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,517
and i really don't think
it'll be necessary

318
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:22,518
for us to examine

319
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:25,020
all the evidence again
in detail.

320
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,022
Now, in the first place,

321
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,024
the prosecution.

322
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,028
They say that the girl
and the dead woman

323
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,031
were on bad terms.

324
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,534
They make it up.

325
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:41,537
Edna druce comes to supper,

326
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:43,539
they both have
a drop too much

327
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,542
and begin quarreling
about some man.

328
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:49,044
For instance, you heard
how the landlady said

329
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,046
that she heard
raised voices.

330
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,548
And the girl
admits as much

331
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,049
but won't give
the name of the man.

332
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,052
Now that
in itself is fishy.

333
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:00,055
The girl gets hold
of the poker,

334
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,057
loses her temper,

335
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:05,060
and there's the end
of edna druce.

336
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:09,565
The prosecution argues
that it has proofs.

337
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,068
Practically
caught red-handed.

338
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:15,571
Girl's dress
all over blood,

339
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,573
the poker at her feet,

340
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,074
brandy flask empty,

341
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,577
and the girl half-silly.

342
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,079
And in addition to that,

343
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:27,449
no other person was known
to have entered the house.

344
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,785
R.
I think that's pretty clea

345
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,171
i think you ought to
mention that the girl

346
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,039
comes of a good family.

347
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,041
Yes, but it's
those so-called

348
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,043
well-bred people

349
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,045
who are able
to remain so brazen

350
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,047
in the face of
a thing like this.

351
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:43,432
Well,
look at the way

352
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,766
she behaved
in the box.

353
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:45,767
Half a minute, ladies.

354
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,769
Let's get on.

355
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,772
Now, take the defense.

356
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:53,275
They don't deny she did it

357
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,777
but argue
that their case is

358
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:57,779
that the thing
happened when...

359
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,782
she was in a fit
or something.

360
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,784
Surely it
is clear to you

361
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,287
that in the evidence
for the defense

362
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:07,289
the doctor put
forward a theory

363
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,291
that it was due
to the independent

364
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,793
activity of the
suppressed experience.

365
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:14,796
In other words,
disassociation,

366
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,798
which in this
particular form

367
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,800
is called a fugue.
So that a person

368
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,969
displaying the
strangest behavior

369
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:22,971
for a considerable
period of time

370
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:24,339
would be quite
unaware of this

371
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:27,175
when he or she
regained normality.

372
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,679
Well, i think the best thing
for us all to do

373
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,180
is to write down
our opinions

374
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:33,432
on a piece of paper,

375
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,735
and then we can see
how we stand.

376
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,239
Whichever
in the minority...

377
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,744
can then give
their individual reasons

378
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,748
and the thing can be
worked out that way.

379
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,365
That makes 7 guilty...

380
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,868
and 3 not guilty.

381
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:28,370
There are 2 not in.

382
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,740
I take it you
haven't come

383
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,709
to any decision
at all.

384
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,712
I think the whole
business is hateful.

385
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:38,213
There's too much
responsibility

386
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:39,715
put on our shoulders.

387
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,217
Either we've got
to let her go free...

388
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,219
that's not fair
to the rest of the world

389
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:46,722
if she's guilty...
or we got to hang her

390
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:47,723
and that's barbarous.

391
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,725
But if we
recommend her to mercy.

392
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,227
Mercy? Is that what
you call it?

393
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:54,229
20 years
cut out of life.

394
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:57,232
The best years
and to spend them in hell.

395
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,735
Have you ever been
inside a prison?

396
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,236
It takes
a civilized community

397
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,739
to think out
a punishment like that.

398
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:05,741
I think
you exaggerate.

399
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:06,742
It's no use
confusing

400
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,744
the issue
like this.

401
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:09,745
People who do wrong

402
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,748
have got to be
punished somehow.

403
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:15,250
You can't run the
world on sentiment.

404
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:17,252
No, but that's what
we've tried to do.

405
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:19,755
Save the unfit.
Get more children

406
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,758
and make glorious wars
to be rid of.

407
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:25,761
The whole world's
a reeking pit of sentiment.

408
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,265
Your verdict,
mr. Shackleton.

409
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,640
Guilty, i suppose.

410
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,061
Who's the other one?

411
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,069
You, mr. Matthews?

412
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,072
Is there anything
special troubling you

413
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,575
so that you can't
make a decision?

414
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,959
Uh... no.

415
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:02,381
What is it prevents you
from making a decision?

416
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,884
Well, nothing really.

417
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,386
Uh, well, uh...

418
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,388
have you made up
your mind at all

419
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:10,889
what it's going to be?

420
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:12,391
Uh... no.

421
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,893
You heard the case
for the prosecution.

422
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,395
That's pretty clear,
isn't it?

423
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,896
Uh, yes.

424
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:20,899
And you know what the
defense is, don't you?

425
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,901
Yes, but i, uh...

426
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:25,904
don't quite understand
what the lady meant

427
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,406
when, uh...

428
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,908
when she said no.

429
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:32,411
When, uh...
when she spoke.

430
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,362
My dear man,

431
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:37,365
mrs. Ward was only
trying to tell you

432
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,366
that the defense was

433
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,368
that murder
was committed

434
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:44,372
in a fit of daytime
sleep walking.

435
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,376
Yes. But, uh...

436
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:51,880
the murder took
place at nighttime.

437
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,383
Can you write?

438
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:56,384
Huh? Yes.

439
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:57,886
Well, will you
please write down

440
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:58,887
on a piece of paper

441
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:01,389
whether you think the
prisoner guilty or not?

442
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,636
Now that leaves
only 3 for not guilty.

443
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:35,140
I'll give you my reaso
ns for not guilty.

444
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,143
The evidence for the
defense by the doctor

445
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,645
is to my mind
conclusive.

446
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,647
Anyone who's followed
the modern trend

447
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,149
of pscyhological
investigations

448
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:46,151
must be aware
that any person

449
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,653
suffering from severe
mental strain,

450
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,655
such as the prisoner
may have been

451
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,158
following on so many
rehearsals and things,

452
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,160
may bring about
a sudden condition

453
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:58,663
in which the patient
is no longer either

454
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,666
conscious of or responsible
for their actions.

455
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,668
We've already
had evidence

456
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:04,669
that the
prisoner's mind

457
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,538
is a delicately
balanced one

458
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:10,675
and quite liable through
some hidden flaw

459
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,094
in that mind
to become deprived

460
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:15,096
of all consciousness

461
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:17,098
and readily enter
into a state

462
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,601
wherein the body
is still functioning,

463
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,438
though no longer under
the control of the will.

464
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,440
And it is
on these grounds,

465
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,442
that i feel
that diana baring

466
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,111
must have been the
victim of circumstance.

467
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:33,114
I have no doubt that
mrs. Ward is right.

468
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:34,115
That being the case,

469
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,117
it is quite
liable to recur,

470
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,119
possibly with
the same results.

471
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:41,122
Well, that's a point
i hadn't considered.

472
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:43,542
Well, it's really
important.

473
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,544
Because with
this poor gal,

474
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,547
you have to consider not
only this one tragedy

475
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,549
but others
that may follow it.

476
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:52,050
There may
be other crimes

477
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:53,552
lying latent in her.

478
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:57,055
You mean, there's a sort
of dual personality in her.

479
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,058
One of these persons
is violent and cruel

480
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,060
and the other,
just an ordinary woman.

481
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,061
Of course.

482
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:06,064
If we set this bad
personality free,

483
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,065
we must be prepared

484
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,068
to show her
the responsibility.

485
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,570
Yes.

486
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,573
If we let her go and
anything should happen...

487
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,075
the blood would be
on our hands.

488
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,579
Do you wish to alter
your verdict, mrs. Ward?

489
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,377
, now, mr. Daniels...
after all you've heard

490
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:38,380
does your opinion still
remain the same?

491
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:43,885
Well, you know, i find it
very difficult to believe

492
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,888
that a girl of that sort
should do such a thing.

493
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:51,393
After all, she looks perfectly
riveting, you know.

494
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,397
Well, you know
what i mean?

495
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:58,650
A sort of girl one
would like for a daughter.

496
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,453
I presume, sir,
that an ugly woman

497
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,622
would stand very little
chance at your hand.

498
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:05,123
The thing you've
got to decide,

499
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,625
mr. Daniels,
has nothing to do

500
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,627
with the qualities
of the young lady

501
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:09,828
as they appeal
to you.

502
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,830
Yes, of course.
I know that.

503
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,333
But, that's all, well,
you know what i mean.

504
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,335
It's... it's pretty
awful and all

505
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,837
that sort of thing.

506
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:21,339
, besides the thing you're thinking of

507
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,842
t?
What's your verdic

508
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,345
well...

509
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,849
well...

510
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,350
oh...

511
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,352
guilty, i suppose.

512
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:44,162
Well, now we're
practically complete.

513
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,948
There's just sir john.

514
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,336
Well, don't dismiss me as
easily at that, mr. Foreman.

515
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,338
G.
Yes? We mustn't be lon

516
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,340
time is money, you know?

517
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:59,344
Time in this case,
may i remind you, is life.

518
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:02,347
If i'm delaying you all,
i apologize.

519
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,350
I admit that i am not...

520
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,352
a man of business.

521
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,721
I'm a poor actor.

522
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:13,608
Oh, come now,
dear sir john.

523
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,610
I repeat...

524
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:19,114
the poorest
of poor players.

525
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,117
And my time on the stage
will be shortened

526
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:25,120
had i not for years
trained myself to...

527
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,123
how shall i put it...

528
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:31,126
to apply
the technique of life...

529
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,629
to the problems
of my art.

530
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:36,131
But today,
ladies and gentlemen,

531
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,133
that process is reversed.

532
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:42,137
I find myself applying
the technique of my art

533
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:45,140
to a problem
of real life.

534
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,596
And my art
is not satisfied.

535
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,735
In the first place,

536
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,237
i am fairly convinced
that diana baring

537
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:00,238
was telling the truth

538
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:02,240
when she said
she remembered nothing.

539
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,244
In fact,
i have been impressed

540
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,447
by her behavior
all through the trial.

541
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,949
But my dear sir!

542
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,334
Oh, i say, sir john.

543
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,253
Oh, please don't
think i'm taking

544
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:18,757
the same line as our
friend mr. Daniels here.

545
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,759
He made a very
gallant attempt,

546
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:24,763
but i assure you my reasoning
goes a little deeper.

547
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,264
I am convinced further

548
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,266
that she was again
telling the truth

549
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:29,768
when she said she had
drunk no brandy.

550
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:31,719
Buy you've forgotten
the evidence

551
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:32,720
of the police sargant.

552
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,722
He said she
smelled of drink

553
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:36,724
and appeared dazed
on arrest.

554
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,226
How do you know

555
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:39,727
that was not the wine
she had at dinner?

556
00:29:39,762 --> 00:29:41,229
What about
the evidence

557
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:42,730
of markham,
the stage manager?

558
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:44,732
He found the empty
brandy flask

559
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,618
right on the spot.
Yes, but...

560
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,537
what about the evidence
of the actor, stewart?

561
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:50,538
He said the women

562
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:53,041
had been enemies
for some time.

563
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:55,043
Ah, he was the one
who said

564
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,045
prisoner was rough
to mrs. Druce

565
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,546
on the stage once.

566
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:02,050
All pointing to her violent
nature, sir john.

567
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:03,918
Yes, but that
was not altogether

568
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:05,420
borne out by fame.

569
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,921
You know, the, um...

570
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:09,174
well, the female
impersonator man.

571
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:10,975
But his evidence was
of little use.

572
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,977
He was so obviously in
love with the prisoner.

573
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,565
In any case, everything
was perfectly clear

574
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,817
when the body
was discovered.

575
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:22,020
Why, the woman
was actually caught

576
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,771
in the room
red-handed.

577
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:25,607
And found with a poker
by her side.

578
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,108
And her dress
all over blood.

579
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,860
And quarrelling
over a man.

580
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,446
That's right.

581
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,281
Any answer to that,
sir john?

582
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,284
Think of her personality.

583
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,670
She's not the kind
of girl to get drunk.

584
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:40,505
Brandy in the flask,
was there?

585
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,789
She doesn't deny it.

586
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:43,291
That's right.

587
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:45,043
Any answer
to that, sir john?

588
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:48,379
Not at the moment.

589
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:49,881
Then there is the question,

590
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,267
was there anyone entered
the house that night?

591
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:53,635
Landlady says not.

592
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,802
Girl says not.

593
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:55,970
They were alone.

594
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:57,222
That's right.

595
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,023
Any answer
to that, sir john?

596
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,477
Not at the moment.

597
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,979
But have we taken it
too much for granted

598
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,365
that no one else
could've done the murder?

599
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,233
They were alone.

600
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:09,617
Says they quarelled.

601
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:10,652
Admits it.

602
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:11,486
That's right.

603
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,988
Any answer
to that, sir john?

604
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,492
She does not admit it.

605
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:20,495
She says she
doesn't remember.

606
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,881
Is that
a guilty woman's answer?

607
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,083
Red-handed.

608
00:31:25,118 --> 00:31:27,585
And her dress
all over blood.

609
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,587
Make an exhibition
of yourself.

610
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,506
Waste of
time, waste of money.

611
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,507
Quarelling.

612
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,008
Hands all over blood.

613
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,010
Any answer?
Any answer?

614
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:38,396
Any answer
to that, sir john?

615
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,758
Well, now that we've all
agreed on our verdict,

616
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,760
i can inform the judge
that we're ready.

617
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,193
Stand up.

618
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,199
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

619
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,701
have you agreed
upon your verdict?

620
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:28,206
And do you find the prisoner
guilty or not guilty?

621
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,208
Guilty.

622
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:33,711
Diana baring,
have you anything to say?

623
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:35,713
My sentence of death

624
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,715
should now
be passed upon you

625
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,217
according to law.

626
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:41,219
It's absurd,
i tell you.

627
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:44,222
It's absolutely absurd.

628
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,725
? Oh, yes,
oh, yes, oh, yes?

629
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,228
Praise silence,
all of you,

630
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,730
on the pain
of imprisonment

631
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,732
while sentence of death

632
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,235
is passed upon the prisoner
at the bar.

633
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:39,110
So the conference

634
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,112
adjourned
until tomorrow.

635
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,614
The baring murder trial

636
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,116
came to
a conclusion today

637
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,118
with a verdict
of guilty,

638
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:51,122
and sentence of death
was passed on diana baring.

639
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,624
And that
is all the news.

640
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,127
But here is an s. o.s.,

641
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,129
which has just been
brought into the studio.

642
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,131
We've been asked by th
e commissioner of police

643
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,632
to broadcast
the following...

644
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,633
will anyone...

645
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,136
brandy cocktail
you ordered, sir.

646
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,138
Right.

647
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,141
Ring up mr. Bennett,
will you?

648
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,642
And ask him to bring
around details

649
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,644
details of the particulars
for the last 3 nights.

650
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,645
For the last 3 nights.

651
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,648
Also, plan on looking
at the flask.

652
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:18,649
Very good, sir john.

653
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,151
Kindly
communicate at once

654
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,654
with news cup in jar to
telephone victoria 7000

655
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,157
or with
any police station.

656
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,162
This is
the national program.

657
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,165
Our concert tonight
is an orchestral one,

658
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:38,169
given by the radio
symphony orchestra.

659
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:40,671
They start by playing
the overture

660
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,559
totristan und isolde
by wagner.

661
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,480
Funny that s. o.s.

662
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,482
Coming on top of that other.

663
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,985
Save her soul.

664
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,487
Save her.

665
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,990
If i'd stood up longer,

666
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:00,992
i might have worn them down.

667
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,496
Why couldn't they see
the girl as i did...

668
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,999
the rest of the fellows
on the jury.

669
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,003
But anyone standing
in the dark

670
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:14,005
on a charge like that...

671
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,007
probably looks different
from the same person

672
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,009
somewhere else.

673
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:22,013
Ah, amusing the way
she stood up to everybody.

674
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:25,516
There's no doubt
that did her a lot of harm.

675
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,521
Yet, it was that
manner of hers that...

676
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,523
very attractive i thought.

677
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,028
And i wonder what
her feelings are now.

678
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,542
Who drank that brandy?!

679
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:55,546
Why didn't i force
that point home to them?

680
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:58,049
Easy to figure these
things out afterwards.

681
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,553
The girl said
she didn't drink it.

682
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:07,558
Yet she admits she might
have killed edna druce.

683
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,560
That's queer.

684
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,562
Why admit a big
thing like that

685
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,564
and yet be sure she
didn't do a small thing

686
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,067
such as drink
a drop of brandy?

687
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,071
All that came
to light to me today.

688
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,075
I'm sure i was right
when i raised that.

689
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,077
Quite frankly,
more certain now.

690
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:29,080
How do we know that someone else
didn't drink the brandy?

691
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,581
Perhaps there
was someone else,

692
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,083
that's the whole thing.

693
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:33,451
Whoever drank that brandy!

694
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:37,755
Mr. Bennett has come up
to see you, sir john.

695
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,192
Sir bennett.

696
00:37:58,227 --> 00:38:00,194
Glad you're back,
sir john.

697
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:02,196
Been reading
about it all.

698
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:03,698
Plenty of publicity.

699
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,199
Been awful
for you, though.

700
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,201
You having
met days before.

701
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,704
Well, she wanted
to become a star,

702
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,706
a year ago that was.

703
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,709
I suppose you can say
in a sense that she has.

704
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,711
A star in a murder...

705
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:18,212
bennett, please.

706
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,215
Look here.

707
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,718
Get hold of my understudy.

708
00:38:23,753 --> 00:38:25,219
Tell him he has
to go on again tonight.

709
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,723
Pray god that i give him
a better role.

710
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:29,724
Oh, and, um...

711
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,726
get on the telephone
straight away

712
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,729
to my lawyer,
mr. Vice senior.

713
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,231
Oh, i can give it to you.

714
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:38,733
Temple bar.

715
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:40,735
5-9-9-3.

716
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,737
Yes.

717
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,752
I want you, as well,

718
00:38:57,787 --> 00:39:00,755
to get hold of
as many as you can

719
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,756
of the members
of that company.

720
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,257
You know,
the touring company

721
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,759
at the time
of the murder.

722
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:06,761
In particular,
the, um...

723
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,764
funny little man,
the stage manager.

724
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,766
I forget his name.

725
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:15,770
I'll see him at the
office in the morning.

726
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,272
Temple bar,
5, double 9, 3.

727
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,274
But i thought
the trial

728
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:21,776
was over, sir john.

729
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,778
No, my dear, bennett,

730
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:25,279
the trial is not over,

731
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,781
by a hell of a long way.

732
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,784
Well... is it conscience,
sir john?

733
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:33,287
Conscience.
A lying man's conscience.

734
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:35,790
Oh, they're...
they're engaged, sir.

735
00:39:35,825 --> 00:39:38,292
Ok. I'll try later.
Don't wait.

736
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,299
I am.

737
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,803
No, don't wait. Go.

738
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,270
Diana baring...

739
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:08,773
why did i send her away?

740
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,275
Told her it'd
be good for her

741
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,277
to gain experience
in the providence.

742
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,779
Good for her.

743
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,783
And now she's come back.

744
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,941
Uh...

745
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:35,442
i think, uh...

746
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:36,944
boiling it
all down, dear,

747
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:37,945
i think perhaps
we better, uh...

748
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:39,947
accept sir john's
offer after all,

749
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:40,948
don't you?

750
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:46,453
Oh, yes.
Either that one

751
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,456
e. Or one of the other
2. It's all the same to m

752
00:41:51,994 --> 00:41:53,961
That would be
sir john himself.

753
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:55,462
I don't think.

754
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:59,466
Oh, well.

755
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:02,469
Seems she won't let us
stay on here any longer.

756
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:03,971
That means lucy
will have to go back

757
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:06,473
to her aunt's...
oh, i mean, uh...

758
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:09,977
sophie will have to go
back to her aunt lucy.

759
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:11,979
I don't want to go
back to aunt lucy.

760
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:13,981
I want to go on tour
with you.

761
00:42:14,016 --> 00:42:15,983
I can't let you go
back to sir john's.

762
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:17,484
Here's a letter.

763
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,987
I really thought you were
kidding me, i really did.

764
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:20,988
What is this?

765
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,993
Ooh. It's from
sir john himself.

766
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:26,994
He'd be happy

767
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:29,997
if we could be in
his office at 12:00.

768
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:31,498
Do you think
we could get there

769
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:32,499
in time today?

770
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,001
If we try.

771
00:42:34,036 --> 00:42:35,502
I'll turn
the kettle off.

772
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:40,558
This just needs
a little benzine.

773
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:42,426
Dear, i don't think...

774
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,014
petrol will get
the shine out of this suit.

775
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:49,149
I'll say! There'
s a job for you!

776
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:50,401
Look sharper.

777
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:52,069
I think it must be
an ankie.

778
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:53,520
Yeah. I think so somewhere.

779
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:55,022
Ted?
Yes, dear?

780
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:56,273
What have you done
with me nail polish?

781
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,575
I haven't seen it.

782
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,827
Here.

783
00:42:59,862 --> 00:43:03,030
Hope this... hope this smell
of petrol goes off.

784
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:05,532
Oh, well, you can blame
it onto the car.

785
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:08,535
I think we shall
just about do it.

786
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:10,537
Actually, my dear,
it won't be.

787
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:12,039
Oh, that's
all right, missus.

788
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:13,540
I promise
you your bill

789
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:14,541
shall be paid
the first.

790
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:15,542
I'm not referring
to bills.

791
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:17,044
It's druce i'm after

792
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:18,045
2-6 to the first 10.

793
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:19,546
All right. We'll see.

794
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,893
How do you do,
mr. Markham?

795
00:43:32,928 --> 00:43:34,194
Nice.
Thanks, sir john.

796
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:42,202
Ohh. How do you do,
sir john?

797
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:43,203
Won't you sit down?

798
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,705
Thank you.

799
00:43:56,216 --> 00:44:00,888
You know, it seems
to me, mr. Markham,

800
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:05,342
that we as artists
have a double function.

801
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,845
We use life
to create art

802
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,732
and we use art to,
how shall i put it...

803
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,184
to criticize life.

804
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,185
You agree?

805
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,687
Oh, certain,
mr. John.

806
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:18,188
Uhh!

807
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,692
Yes. I knew you would.

808
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:23,694
Now, mr. Markham,

809
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,195
between artists...

810
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,196
ahem.

811
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,699
Do we always fulfill
our double function?

812
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,701
Are we not
so much occupied

813
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,703
in using life
to create art

814
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:34,705
that we forget
our other function?

815
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,709
I foresee
your objection.

816
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:39,710
You're going to say,

817
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,712
what opportunities does
the round

818
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,213
of daily life offer?

819
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:44,715
I wonder if...

820
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,216
if you ever saw

821
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,719
a problem play
i once did.

822
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,721
Pistols for two.

823
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:51,722
Oh, yes.

824
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:52,723
You did.
Yes.

825
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,726
What the critics describe
as a high-brow shocker.

826
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:57,227
Now...

827
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:01,231
when a high-brow shocker
occurs in real life,

828
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,735
does the public
call in the actor?

829
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,736
No.

830
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,237
Uh...

831
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:09,239
mr. Markham,
i read your thoughts.

832
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,246
You know, you're
saying to yourself,

833
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,249
this man is, um,
talking to his hat.

834
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:20,250
Oh, no.

835
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:22,252
Oh, of course you are.

836
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,254
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be the practical man

837
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,256
i take you for.

838
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,758
You're also wondering
to yourself,

839
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,260
why on earth
i've brought you here.

840
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:31,762
Well...

841
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:35,265
that brings me at last...

842
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,267
to my object.

843
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:38,769
Now...

844
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:40,771
yesterday and
the day before,

845
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,775
i was on the jury
at the baring trial.

846
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,278
You impressed me both as
an artist and as a man.

847
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,279
Ooh.

848
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:52,282
By the way you gave
your evidence.

849
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,284
Now, i want from you,

850
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,170
if i'm not being
too indiscrete...

851
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:57,087
oh, no.

852
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:59,590
The inner history
of that case.

853
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,596
Oh, what is
it that, uh...

854
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,599
see, now, of course, um...

855
00:46:08,634 --> 00:46:10,100
bennett talked over with you

856
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:13,103
the question
of that engagement?

857
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,104
No, sir.

858
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,606
You see, we'd rather, uh...

859
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:18,108
rather hoped that you'd
be free to take on

860
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,110
the stage management
when i send off

861
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:23,113
this tour at christmas
ofthe green eye.

862
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:24,615
Whew.

863
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,617
I also thought of working
out some arrangement

864
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:27,618
of a yearly basis,

865
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:29,620
but we could easily
talk that over later

866
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:31,121
with bennett, can't we?

867
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:33,624
Oh. Thank you very
much indeed, sir john.

868
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,209
I, uh...

869
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,212
well, i am free
at the moment.

870
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:40,214
And i've had
a lot of experience

871
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,216
that i'm sure
will come in very handy.

872
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,218
Then that's
settled, huh?

873
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:46,220
Uh, yes.

874
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,222
What? What is it,
mr. Markham?

875
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,225
Well, it's my wife,
sir john.

876
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,228
You see, we've always
been joint,

877
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,730
as you may say and, uh...

878
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,233
well, would it be
asking too much, sir john,

879
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,236
if a part, i mean,
any part that you...

880
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,239
ohh. I see.
Mrs. Markham acts.

881
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:06,740
Acts, sir john?

882
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:08,242
Heh. Well, uh...

883
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,245
perhaps it's not for me
to say, but...

884
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,746
but my doucie...

885
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,249
well, you may say i'm
prejudiced, sir john,

886
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,751
but i've been stage manager
now for 10 years,

887
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,254
and it is a fact that
a wife, even a good one,

888
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,256
is not always the right thing
to have in a company,

889
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,258
if you understand
what i'm getting at,

890
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,260
but my doucie, my wife,

891
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:29,263
she's... well, professionally,
she's been my right hand.

892
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:32,266
And there's no one she can't
play 24 hours' notice.

893
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:33,267
All ladies.

894
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,770
From a gladys cooper
to a molly lloyd part.

895
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:39,273
Has she ever...
she has her...

896
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:40,274
oh, but...

897
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:41,775
no, no, no.
Go on. Do.

898
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,278
I was going to say she has
her off days, of course.

899
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:45,779
Well, who hasn't?

900
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:47,281
Yes. I mean,
only last summer

901
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:49,783
i had to speak to her
seriously about it.

902
00:47:49,818 --> 00:47:52,786
She had a quick
change-over from a barmaid

903
00:47:52,821 --> 00:47:54,788
to a salvation army lass.

904
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:57,291
And it told on her,
there's no doubt about it,

905
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,792
it told on her.

906
00:47:58,827 --> 00:48:00,794
After about a week,
i said to her straight out,

907
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,296
now look here, my dear,

908
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:03,797
this can't go on.

909
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:05,799
If you can't
pull yourself together,

910
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,302
we shall have
to go into shakespeare.

911
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,305
Well, she didn't say much.

912
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,307
Not one that was reasonable.

913
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:15,309
But she thought it over.

914
00:48:15,344 --> 00:48:17,311
And for the rest
of that tour

915
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:19,313
i'll give you
my word, sir john,

916
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:20,814
she was tallulah.

917
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:22,983
Pure tallulah.

918
00:48:23,018 --> 00:48:24,484
Where is mrs. Markham now?

919
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,486
She's downstairs
waiting in the...

920
00:48:26,521 --> 00:48:27,988
oh. One minute then.

921
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:30,490
Let's send
for her to come up.

922
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,996
What, is that you, bennett?

923
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,998
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. No.

924
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,500
Wait.

925
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,505
Hello, bennett, mrs. Markham
is somewhere downstairs.

926
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,008
Would you have her
sent up, please?

927
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,511
Yes. Yes, of course.
Up to my room.

928
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,517
Now, mr. Markham...

929
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,519
about this trial...

930
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:03,523
i confess to feeling
very uneasy about it.

931
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,525
You see, i played
a part in the thing,

932
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,527
the part of a juryman.

933
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,530
And it was not until
the curtain was rung down

934
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,033
on the death sentence,
that i said to myself...

935
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:18,538
this is not a play,
this is life.

936
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,540
Life can be less kind

937
00:49:20,575 --> 00:49:22,542
than your dramatists,
mr. Markham.

938
00:49:22,577 --> 00:49:25,829
Life permits a beautiful
and unfortunate girl

939
00:49:25,864 --> 00:49:28,832
to go to the gallows.
Unless...

940
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:33,337
art for once can bring
its technique to bear.

941
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:35,305
Good lord,
do you mean to say

942
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,306
you think she's...

943
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,808
innocent,
my dear markham, yes.

944
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,767
It was assumed
she was guilty

945
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:48,268
because she couldn'’
’t deny it.

946
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:49,770
Yes, but i saw the...

947
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:50,771
what did you see?

948
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:52,773
Diana baring sitting
beside the dead body.

949
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:54,274
She was dazed you say.

950
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:56,276
What was
the cause? Drink?

951
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:58,779
She hardly ever
touched anything.

952
00:49:58,814 --> 00:50:01,281
And who did? Think
it over, mr. Markham.

953
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:03,283
Then there was the pain
in her head.

954
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:05,285
Was she examined
by a doctor?

955
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:08,789
Might he not have found
traces of a blow

956
00:50:08,824 --> 00:50:10,791
if he'd examined her?

957
00:50:10,826 --> 00:50:11,792
But no, he didn't.

958
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:13,293
He assumed
like everyone else

959
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:14,294
that she was guilty

960
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:15,796
because she
didn't deny it.

961
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:18,298
And there was no
private investigation,

962
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,300
no inquiry,

963
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,186
think it over,
mr. Markham.

964
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:29,559
You know,

965
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,561
i feel the most
terrible responsibility.

966
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,563
I was one
of the 12 people

967
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,066
who decided the fate
of this poor girl.

968
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:38,068
I'd found myself
caught up

969
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:39,569
with the machine that...

970
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,072
That makes
these things...

971
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,577
ah, mrs. Markham,
so good of you to come

972
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,079
with your husband
this morning.

973
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:50,330
Oh, i was
quite glad,

974
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:52,332
glad as a breath
of fresh air.

975
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:56,837
Ohh. What a charming
place you have up here,

976
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:58,338
sir john.

977
00:50:58,373 --> 00:50:59,840
And piccadilly,

978
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,842
with all
the shops so near.

979
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,351
You'll, um...

980
00:51:11,386 --> 00:51:12,853
you'll stay
to lunch, of course.

981
00:51:12,888 --> 00:51:13,854
Ohh!

982
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:14,855
You know,
i must confess,

983
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:16,857
i find it difficult
sometimes to wait

984
00:51:16,892 --> 00:51:18,859
to a reasonable hour
for my luncheon.

985
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:19,860
Yes, i must say,

986
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,361
i feel
the same way myself.

987
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:22,362
It's very rare

988
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:23,747
that i can do
without my little

989
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,031
tidbits
in the morning...

990
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,001
Oh, javier, a cocktail
at once, please,

991
00:51:28,036 --> 00:51:29,002
and serve lunch.

992
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,003
hey.

993
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,005
He's engaged us
to see him.

994
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,757
Joint.
No.

995
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:37,043
Yes. I find mr. Markham
is free to join me.

996
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:39,429
So... please.

997
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:41,348
So i thought
he could, um...

998
00:51:41,383 --> 00:51:43,350
oh, we can settle
all that later,

999
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:44,851
can't we? Yes, please.

1000
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,355
Thank you.

1001
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,857
Oh, thank you.

1002
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,362
Oh, one more, please.

1003
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,712
In the meantime, success
to our researches.

1004
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,134
Your husband and i have
been discussing

1005
00:52:17,169 --> 00:52:18,635
the baring case.

1006
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,137
And we feel that
if the murder

1007
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:22,639
were approached
from another angle,

1008
00:52:22,674 --> 00:52:27,144
it... oh, sorry.
We shall be able

1009
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:29,146
to arrive
at a different result.

1010
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,148
What?

1011
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:33,650
What? And get diana
off you mean?

1012
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:37,354
But she can't
get away from that poker.

1013
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,170
If you don't share
our convictions

1014
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:56,173
that miss baring
is not guilty...

1015
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,176
Well...

1016
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,178
well, i mean to say
diana baring

1017
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:02,679
was such
a nice girl.

1018
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:04,681
I never thought
for one moment

1019
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:07,184
she could've done
a thing like that.

1020
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:08,685
Didn't
i always say, ted,

1021
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,187
that anybody
who knew her

1022
00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:12,189
never could've thought
it for one moment?

1023
00:53:12,224 --> 00:53:14,691
Oh, sir john, have you
found anything out?

1024
00:53:14,726 --> 00:53:16,693
Are you going to take it
up yourself?

1025
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:18,695
Oh, we would be so glad

1026
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,197
to help,
wouldn't we, ted?

1027
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:24,818
Shall we now?

1028
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:31,825
I really don't kno
w where to begin

1029
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:33,827
this thing,
do you, markham?

1030
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:37,831
Well, uh...
well, yes, sir john.

1031
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:39,833
Oh, i see. Uh...

1032
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:40,834
oops.

1033
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,336
Yes. I wish i knew
where to begin.

1034
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:44,838
Here.

1035
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:58,351
Yes, can i help
you there?

1036
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:02,355
Sir john didn't know
where to begin, ted.

1037
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,356
Huh?

1038
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:06,159
No, no. Let's
hear it, mrs. Markham.

1039
00:54:06,194 --> 00:54:08,161
See, i'm completely
in the dark.

1040
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:10,163
If your husband
could show the way,

1041
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,165
i shall be more
than grateful.

1042
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,670
Go on.
What is it, markham?

1043
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:18,171
Well, sir john...

1044
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:20,173
i should say
the best place

1045
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,675
would be the back
of the town

1046
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,677
where the murder
was committed.

1047
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,683
Yes. Do you think
you could spare me

1048
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:31,434
a day or two
of your time?

1049
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,770
Why, yes, of course
we could, sir.

1050
00:54:33,805 --> 00:54:35,272
See, if i might suggest

1051
00:54:35,307 --> 00:54:37,274
that we could
go over the ground

1052
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,775
and you could show me
one or two places

1053
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,277
connected
with the murder.

1054
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:42,279
But, you mean, it
might have been

1055
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:43,780
someone else
altogether,

1056
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:44,781
what killed
edna druce?

1057
00:54:44,816 --> 00:54:46,283
Well, i don't know.

1058
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:48,285
It might've been
somebody from outside.

1059
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,287
How do you make
that out?

1060
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:51,788
Well, i don't know.

1061
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:53,790
Miss mitcham
didn't do it.

1062
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:56,293
And miss diana didn't.

1063
00:54:56,328 --> 00:54:58,295
So it must've been
somebody from outside.

1064
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,797
If it was,
they'd have to get in.

1065
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:02,799
And they'd have
to get out again.

1066
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,301
Heh. That's clever

1067
00:55:04,336 --> 00:55:07,304
well, all
i can say is...

1068
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:08,805
the first thing
we got to do

1069
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,808
is to find out
who saw somebody,

1070
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:14,311
apart from druce,
anywhere near there

1071
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:15,812
at half-past one
that morning.

1072
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:18,315
Well, ted, for start,
there's that chap

1073
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,816
we thought was
the policeman

1074
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:21,318
coming around
the corner.

1075
00:55:21,353 --> 00:55:22,819
Oh, that was nothing.

1076
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:23,820
Just a minute.

1077
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:25,822
I shall like
to hear something

1078
00:55:25,857 --> 00:55:27,324
about this policeman.

1079
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,826
Well, you see,
sir john,

1080
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:32,329
it was like this...

1081
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:34,331
only after
the murder,

1082
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:36,333
when the knocking
woke us up,

1083
00:55:36,368 --> 00:55:38,335
i was over
by the window

1084
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,336
slipping on
my negligee,

1085
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:41,338
and i popped my head
out of the window

1086
00:55:41,373 --> 00:55:43,340
to see who it was making
all that noise.

1087
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,841
And i saw the policeman

1088
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:46,343
coming around
the corner.

1089
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:47,844
So i said to ted,

1090
00:55:47,879 --> 00:55:49,846
i said,
hey, it's the police.

1091
00:55:49,881 --> 00:55:52,349
And then i took
my eyes off him

1092
00:55:52,384 --> 00:55:54,351
to tell ted here...

1093
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:56,853
and when i looked again,

1094
00:55:56,888 --> 00:55:59,356
there was
no one in sight.

1095
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:00,857
And then ted said,

1096
00:56:00,892 --> 00:56:02,359
yes, you're right.
Here he comes.

1097
00:56:02,394 --> 00:56:04,861
And when
i looked again,

1098
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:07,364
it was a different
policeman altogether.

1099
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,368
What had become
of the first one?

1100
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:12,869
I have no idea, sir.

1101
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:15,705
He must have turned
the corner and come back.

1102
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,708
Is that the corner
down there?

1103
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:20,210
Yes, that's it, sir.

1104
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,213
N? You're sure it wasn't the same ma

1105
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:24,714
well, it couldn't
have been.

1106
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:27,717
We only took our eyes off
of him about 2 seconds.

1107
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,219
Oh, blast.

1108
00:56:29,254 --> 00:56:32,722
Uh... is there anymore
here do you think, sir?

1109
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:34,090
I shouldn't
think so.

1110
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:49,939
My god, that's druce.

1111
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,941
He must be crazy.

1112
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,444
Yeah, we better get down.

1113
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,032
You are
not going in my house.

1114
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:09,042
Take him away, please.

1115
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:11,377
He's done this before.

1116
00:57:11,412 --> 00:57:12,879
Please, promise to stop it.

1117
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:14,380
Yes, that's
all right.

1118
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:15,381
Now come along,
druce.

1119
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:16,382
My wife's...

1120
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:17,383
yes, i know.

1121
00:57:17,418 --> 00:57:18,885
But you're muc
h better at home.

1122
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:22,889
Come on.
Come on now.

1123
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:33,900
Oh, this is terrible

1124
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,902
for me this business is.

1125
00:57:35,937 --> 00:57:38,905
I shall have to move.
I'm sure i shall.

1126
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,406
Yes. Well, uh...

1127
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:41,908
mrs. Mitcham,

1128
00:57:41,943 --> 00:57:42,909
we'd like
to show

1129
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:43,910
this gentleman
around.

1130
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,912
That is, if you
don't mind.

1131
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:47,914
May i?

1132
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:50,416
Oh. Yes, sir.
Of course.

1133
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,919
Yes. Certainly.
Will you come in?

1134
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,068
Well, sir john,

1135
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,070
that's where
they found the body.

1136
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,573
Right in front
of the hearth there.

1137
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:16,576
And, uh...

1138
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:19,078
miss baring was sitting
just about there.

1139
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:22,582
Oh, by the way, did you ever
get your poker back, miss...

1140
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:24,584
oh, i can't bear
to talk about it,

1141
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:26,586
especially with
poor miss baring

1142
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:28,087
being where she is.

1143
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:32,091
Why, you might as well
convict cleopatra.

1144
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,099
You think anybody
could've got in

1145
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:42,101
from the back
of the house?

1146
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,108
You see just beyond
the backyard

1147
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,110
y,
there's an alleywa

1148
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:52,612
and just
beyond there

1149
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:53,613
e.
There's the theatr

1150
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,615
and look, sir,
the dressing rooms

1151
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,116
are off the back.

1152
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,120
Yes, it would
take quite an athlete

1153
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:02,121
to get in that way.

1154
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,623
I don't see how

1155
00:59:03,658 --> 00:59:05,625
anyone could
get in here

1156
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,626
with this
aspedstria

1157
00:59:06,661 --> 00:59:07,627
filling up
the window.

1158
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:09,128
Anyway, without
upsetting it,

1159
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:10,630
and look
at the size of it.

1160
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,633
Yes. It's a fine plant.

1161
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,635
Unless, of course,
it was somebody

1162
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,136
who knew the room.

1163
00:59:17,171 --> 00:59:19,639
But miss baring did not
have any visitors,

1164
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,641
only mrs. Markham
every now and again,

1165
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:24,143
and mr. Fane and
mr. Stewart to tea

1166
00:59:24,178 --> 00:59:25,645
and mister...
what's his name...

1167
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,147
the little man with
the squeaky voice.

1168
00:59:28,182 --> 00:59:29,649
Oh, tom druid.

1169
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:31,150
Yes. Yes, that's him.

1170
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,663
Squeaky voice,
that reminds me.

1171
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,165
In your evidence,
miss mitcham,

1172
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,168
you said you had heard
angry women's voices.

1173
00:59:49,203 --> 00:59:50,670
Yes, sir, i did.

1174
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,672
Would you swear to that?

1175
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:55,675
E. Oh, yes, sir. You can'
t mistake a woman's voic

1176
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:07,186
you know, i had
known a contralto...

1177
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:09,689
oh, yes, but this
was high, quite high.

1178
01:00:09,724 --> 01:00:11,691
miss mitcham.
Miss mitcham.

1179
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,694
Oh, my god, miss mitcham.
Where are you?

1180
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:16,696
The kitchen chimney's
on fire, miss mitcham!

1181
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,197
That's alice.

1182
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,699
One moment, miss mitcham.

1183
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,702
Excuse me, sir.
I can't stop just now.

1184
01:00:22,737 --> 01:00:23,703
That alice
of mine has set

1185
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,204
the kitchen chimney
on fire.

1186
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,706
Didn't you hear
her calling?

1187
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:28,207
No, no, no.
That was me.

1188
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,709
Or did i...

1189
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,711
you know, markham,
i never know.

1190
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,715
I'm ashamed to say,

1191
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,717
i played a trick
on you, miss mitcham.

1192
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:40,219
Now, the high voice
you heard that night

1193
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:46,225
may not have been a woman's.
You've just admitted it.

1194
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,728
No. I have not
admitted anything.

1195
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,731
And i don't hold to
playing such tricks.

1196
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,733
And i'd like
to ask you, sir,

1197
01:00:53,768 --> 01:00:55,234
what you mean by it.

1198
01:00:57,271 --> 01:00:58,738
And you, too,
mr. Markham.

1199
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,740
Standing there,
grinning.

1200
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,243
You realize that
your evidence as it stands

1201
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,746
may hang miss baring?

1202
01:01:06,781 --> 01:01:07,747
Ohh!

1203
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:09,248
Now, i'm not blaming you.

1204
01:01:09,283 --> 01:01:10,750
Not blaming you,
miss mitcham.

1205
01:01:10,785 --> 01:01:12,752
But you swore
that you heard

1206
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,253
women's voices calling.

1207
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,255
And i have
to prove to them

1208
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,257
that it might have
been a man's voice,

1209
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:20,259
especially a high-pitched
man's voice...

1210
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,261
just like mr. Druid's.

1211
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:25,264
Ohh! I'd do anything
for miss baring.

1212
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:27,266
Oh, can't something
be done now?

1213
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:29,769
Yes, yes. Now you're
going to help us further.

1214
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:32,271
First of all,
could you show us

1215
01:01:32,306 --> 01:01:33,773
some more of the house?

1216
01:01:33,808 --> 01:01:35,274
Miss baring's bedroom,
for example?

1217
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,776
Yes. Certainly, sir.

1218
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,277
This way, please.

1219
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,700
I don't think you'll
find much in here, sir.

1220
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,535
There's a few
of her things

1221
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,036
over there
on the windowsill.

1222
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,038
I didn't like
to send them

1223
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:51,040
to where she is now.

1224
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,042
Oh, i think
she'd like them.

1225
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:54,043
Well, let me
have them

1226
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:55,545
and i'll send
them on.

1227
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,305
Why, it's
one of you, sir.

1228
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:21,821
Uh... lot more places
to go to, sir john.

1229
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,335
Thank you.

1230
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,337
Thank you
very much indeed.

1231
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,338
Thank you.

1232
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,840
Thank you
very much.

1233
01:02:41,876 --> 01:02:43,342
Yes. Lot more
places, sir john.

1234
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:44,844
There's
the stage door

1235
01:02:44,879 --> 01:02:46,345
and then we'll go roun
d to stewart's lodgings

1236
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,847
and then
we might go along

1237
01:02:47,882 --> 01:02:48,848
to the police
station,

1238
01:02:48,883 --> 01:02:49,849
have a chat
with the inspector.

1239
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,851
He knows me.
And then, um...

1240
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:54,353
well, then we can go
across the red lion,

1241
01:02:54,388 --> 01:02:55,855
g have a sandwich while we're talkin

1242
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,356
to joe
the proprieter.

1243
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:58,858
And then... ooh,

1244
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,359
and then
there's stevens,

1245
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:02,361
if the policeman's
still on his beat.

1246
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:05,865
Yes, i think that'
s about all we can do.

1247
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,366
Oh, yes, we'll fin
d out something

1248
01:03:07,401 --> 01:03:08,868
if it takes us
all night.

1249
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:10,369
I thought perhaps, um...

1250
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,371
a little dinner...

1251
01:03:12,406 --> 01:03:14,373
oh. Oh, that's all
right, sir john.

1252
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,876
Don't you worry
about doucie and me.

1253
01:03:16,911 --> 01:03:17,877
We've had to go
without before,

1254
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:18,878
didn't we, dear?

1255
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,379
Oh, i should say.

1256
01:03:20,414 --> 01:03:22,882
Well, shall we begin,
sir john? This way.

1257
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:40,516
Evening, mate.

1258
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:41,517
I've come to see
if any of my people

1259
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,519
left anything behind.

1260
01:03:43,554 --> 01:03:44,520
No, nothing,

1261
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:45,521
except that there
broken basin

1262
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:46,989
in number 4
dressing room.

1263
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:47,940
That was some

1264
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:49,442
of your chaps
after they left.

1265
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:51,444
They never paid
for it neither.

1266
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:52,945
Whose room was that?

1267
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,947
Uh, fane's and stewart's
, i believe, sir.

1268
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,950
No, none of our people
broke that, mate.

1269
01:03:57,985 --> 01:03:59,952
Oh, there is
something for you.

1270
01:03:59,987 --> 01:04:02,421
This cigarette case left
behind in number 4.

1271
01:04:02,456 --> 01:04:03,923
You'll know
who it belong to.

1272
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,424
Oh, righto. When
i find out who it is,

1273
01:04:05,459 --> 01:04:06,926
i'll forward it.

1274
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:08,878
Can we see
that dressing room?

1275
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:11,848
Uh, i'd like to see
that broken basin.

1276
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:13,716
I'll take you long

1277
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,911
where does that window
look out to?

1278
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:44,413
The private houses
round the corner.

1279
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:47,216
I wish i knew
who broke that basin.

1280
01:04:53,673 --> 01:04:56,008
Lot more places to
go to, sir john.

1281
01:05:15,027 --> 01:05:16,529
Thank you, mate.

1282
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:18,030
Good day.

1283
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:19,949
Did you find anything?

1284
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:20,950
No, nothing much.

1285
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,452
Oh, honestly.

1286
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,802
Well, here we are,
sir john.

1287
01:05:39,837 --> 01:05:42,805
And, uh, i hope
you sleep well.

1288
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,806
I expect you'll find

1289
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,309
she's left something
cold out for you.

1290
01:05:46,344 --> 01:05:48,811
I'll be along
first thing in the morning.

1291
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,817
I'm awfully sorry but...
get to bed myself.

1292
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,822
I must say, this street
gives me the creeps.

1293
01:05:59,857 --> 01:06:01,324
Well, good night, sir john.

1294
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,825
Come along, dear.

1295
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,335
I say, markham.

1296
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,842
Markham...

1297
01:06:19,877 --> 01:06:22,345
you don't think
that i'd better

1298
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,098
eat at the red lion
after all, do you?

1299
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,851
Well, that's, uh...

1300
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:30,853
just as you like,
of course, sir john,

1301
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:31,854
but, uh...

1302
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,856
i thought you
wanted to sleep

1303
01:06:33,891 --> 01:06:34,857
se
at the policeman's hou

1304
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:36,359
so as to be able
to find out something.

1305
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:38,861
I mean, that's why
i made the arrangements.

1306
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:40,363
I mean...

1307
01:06:40,398 --> 01:06:41,864
considering
we haven't found out

1308
01:06:41,899 --> 01:06:44,367
very much today,
i think that...

1309
01:06:44,402 --> 01:06:46,869
it'd be better
if you did, sir.

1310
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:48,371
Perhaps
you're right.

1311
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,373
Good night,
mrs. Markham.

1312
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,375
Oh, good night,
sir john.

1313
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,876
Excuse me, sir.

1314
01:07:36,335 --> 01:07:39,088
Be quiet.
You, too, children.

1315
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:40,589
Take it.

1316
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,591
Ohh.

1317
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,094
We mustn't play
on the bed.

1318
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,096
Sir, shall i pull
over the table?

1319
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,982
Leave them things be!

1320
01:07:50,017 --> 01:07:51,317
Oh, please,
don't trouble.

1321
01:07:51,352 --> 01:07:53,319
Just put the plate
on somewhere.

1322
01:07:53,354 --> 01:07:54,320
I'll, uh...

1323
01:07:54,355 --> 01:07:56,822
i'll see to it.
I'll dress first.

1324
01:07:56,857 --> 01:07:58,324
Oh, don't say that, sir.

1325
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:00,326
I know what
you gents like.

1326
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:03,829
"A nice cup of tea and
a kipper before i get up.

1327
01:08:03,864 --> 01:08:05,331
And i'm a new man. "

1328
01:08:05,366 --> 01:08:07,833
That's what my last
lodger used to say.

1329
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,172
Stop playing
on that bed!

1330
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:14,673
Damn children.

1331
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,675
They follow me about.

1332
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,677
Ma this and ma that.

1333
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,181
On my word, i don't
have a moment's peace

1334
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:23,933
morning or night.

1335
01:08:23,968 --> 01:08:26,469
What do you
two be doing?

1336
01:08:26,504 --> 01:08:27,303
That's quite
all right, really.

1337
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:28,687
He's got my bootsy

1338
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,022
well, i never did.

1339
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:32,391
Wait till i
get you downstairs.

1340
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:38,230
Take this kitten down

1341
01:08:38,265 --> 01:08:40,232
and don't you
bring it up here again.

1342
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:41,233
Now, please,

1343
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:43,736
if you could put
this plate on the table

1344
01:08:43,771 --> 01:08:45,738
and bring up some
hot water at once,

1345
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:46,739
i'll get up.

1346
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:47,740
Just as you
like, sir, but...

1347
01:08:50,242 --> 01:08:53,129
Now, go downstairs and
get the water on. Go on.

1348
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,381
Now, why can't
you leave him be?

1349
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:56,882
Time and time again,

1350
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:58,884
i've told them not to mess
with the lodger's luggage.

1351
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,220
I'll have your father take
you to the police station

1352
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,222
if you can't stop touching.

1353
01:09:03,257 --> 01:09:05,224
They do keep on touching.

1354
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:07,226
Some lodgers
don't like it.

1355
01:09:07,261 --> 01:09:10,229
Princeton, i had a couple
a little while back

1356
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:13,232
and one of them give them
a good clip for doing that.

1357
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:14,233
You know
the baring case?

1358
01:09:14,268 --> 01:09:15,484
Well,
they was in it.

1359
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:16,819
As a matter of fact,

1360
01:09:16,854 --> 01:09:19,321
it was my husband
what found the body.

1361
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:22,825
He was part
of the baring case.

1362
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,328
ohh.
Well, i never.

1363
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:29,331
Ha ha! She's taken
a fancy to you.

1364
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,834
There ain't many
she takes to.

1365
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:33,335
You're not
coming around now,

1366
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,336
i suppose.

1367
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,838
Yes, oh, yes.

1368
01:09:35,873 --> 01:09:37,840
You were saying...

1369
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,842
about hopping
on the luggage...

1370
01:09:39,877 --> 01:09:41,126
oh, yes. Well,

1371
01:09:41,161 --> 01:09:42,127
arthur
was messing about

1372
01:09:42,162 --> 01:09:43,629
with one
of them's luggage

1373
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:45,130
when he come across
what he thought

1374
01:09:45,165 --> 01:09:47,132
was his father's
helmet and uniform.

1375
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,634
Afterwards,
i went up.

1376
01:09:48,669 --> 01:09:49,635
Mr. Fane, it was.

1377
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,136
And i said i don't
like the idea

1378
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:52,638
of having this
in my home.

1379
01:09:52,673 --> 01:09:55,140
Just because he had
a uniform in the bag

1380
01:09:55,175 --> 01:09:56,141
he only thought

1381
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:57,643
it was his father'
s outfit.

1382
01:09:57,678 --> 01:09:59,645
I felt a bit of a fool
when i finished

1383
01:10:00,145 --> 01:10:01,647
because he simply
turned around

1384
01:10:01,682 --> 01:10:03,148
and he said
i didn't know

1385
01:10:03,183 --> 01:10:04,149
what i was
talking about.

1386
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,151
Well, i said
if it wasn't you,

1387
01:10:06,186 --> 01:10:07,653
it must have been
the other one

1388
01:10:07,688 --> 01:10:09,154
who was here...
mr. Stewart.

1389
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:10,656
I spoke to mr. Stewart
afterwards

1390
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:12,157
but in the excitement
of the murder

1391
01:10:12,192 --> 01:10:13,158
i forgot all about it.

1392
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:18,714
Come in, my dear markham.

1393
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:23,219
I thought
i'd drop by, miss.

1394
01:10:23,254 --> 01:10:25,721
I'll send
the water up, sir.

1395
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:27,223
Come along,
now, come along.

1396
01:10:27,258 --> 01:10:29,225
Don't encourage her too
much, sir. That's right.

1397
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,226
Run along down.

1398
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:32,228
Here, arthur.
Just come on, come on.

1399
01:10:32,263 --> 01:10:34,230
Now go
in the street and play.

1400
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:36,232
Don't you get
run over. Go on.

1401
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:37,733
That's right, go on.

1402
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,239
Doucie and me found out
something, sir john.

1403
01:10:43,274 --> 01:10:44,740
Won't you sit down?

1404
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:45,741
Thanks.

1405
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,744
You know that cigarette case
you found in the theatre?

1406
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:50,746
Well, last night i went
to smoke in bed

1407
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:52,248
just before i went off,
you see?

1408
01:10:52,283 --> 01:10:53,749
So i took out that case.

1409
01:10:53,784 --> 01:10:55,251
Doucie saw it wasn't mine.

1410
01:10:55,286 --> 01:10:57,253
Said, i've seen it
before somewhere.

1411
01:10:57,288 --> 01:10:58,754
I said, whose is it?
She said stewart's.

1412
01:10:58,789 --> 01:11:00,756
And then she took it,

1413
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:03,759
she noticed what i thought
was a beer stain on it...

1414
01:11:03,794 --> 01:11:05,761
she says, wait a minute.
That's blood on it.

1415
01:11:05,796 --> 01:11:07,763
And sure enough. Well,
look, see for yourself,

1416
01:11:07,798 --> 01:11:09,265
sir john. Look.

1417
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,768
I believe you're right

1418
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,273
stewart.

1419
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,776
Who wore
a policeman's uniform

1420
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:22,778
in the past
who lived here?

1421
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:24,780
Fane and stewart, sir.

1422
01:11:24,815 --> 01:11:25,781
Stewart had
a quick change-over

1423
01:11:25,816 --> 01:11:27,283
with fane
in the third act.

1424
01:11:27,318 --> 01:11:30,286
But fane had a special
uniform made to fit him

1425
01:11:30,321 --> 01:11:33,289
so we had 2 uniforms
in the company, sir john.

1426
01:11:33,324 --> 01:11:36,292
You're an important factor
in this case, markham.

1427
01:11:36,327 --> 01:11:38,294
In fact, most important
at the moment.

1428
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:40,296
Well, uh...

1429
01:11:40,331 --> 01:11:42,798
well, if it helps, sir john.

1430
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,800
No, the most
important factor

1431
01:11:44,835 --> 01:11:46,802
seems to be
a policeman

1432
01:11:46,837 --> 01:11:48,304
whom you did not see

1433
01:11:48,339 --> 01:11:49,805
on the night
of the murder.

1434
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,807
You remember your
wife saw a policeman

1435
01:11:51,842 --> 01:11:53,309
coming down the street.

1436
01:11:53,344 --> 01:11:55,311
You went to the window
and you couldn't see one.

1437
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:56,812
Then suddenly there
was a policeman.

1438
01:11:56,847 --> 01:11:58,814
Now, markham...

1439
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:02,318
that policeman was
2 different people.

1440
01:12:02,353 --> 01:12:04,320
And for all we know...

1441
01:12:04,355 --> 01:12:05,821
the first one
was not a member

1442
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,323
of the county
constabulary.

1443
01:12:07,358 --> 01:12:09,825
You mean, the first one
was a fake, sir?

1444
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,327
A chap in
policeman's clothes?

1445
01:12:11,362 --> 01:12:14,330
Our next job is to find
out the name of the man

1446
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:15,331
miss baring withheld.

1447
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:17,333
Was he a member
of the company?

1448
01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:19,835
Did he wear
a policeman's uniform?

1449
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,338
If she still refuses
to give the name...

1450
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,844
perhaps the cigarette case
will help her to remember.

1451
01:12:28,879 --> 01:12:30,346
You mean, the name
of the man

1452
01:12:30,381 --> 01:12:32,348
they were calling about
on the night of the murder?

1453
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,593
This end, please.

1454
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,103
Won't you sit down?

1455
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:02,604
Oh.

1456
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,106
Thank you.

1457
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,662
It's very good
of you to have come.

1458
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,665
But i can't help saying...

1459
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,670
i'm extremely surprised.

1460
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,173
Well, you see, i...

1461
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,174
naturally, i...

1462
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:41,760
i've taken a very grea
t interest in your case.

1463
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,346
Don't let's talk about it.

1464
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,852
How's your play going?

1465
01:14:49,887 --> 01:14:53,355
Oh... pretty fair.

1466
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:56,358
Of course you know i was
away from it some time

1467
01:14:56,393 --> 01:14:59,862
because i was on
the jury of your trial.

1468
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,366
I know.

1469
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,253
I wondered...

1470
01:15:08,288 --> 01:15:10,506
my countryhouse is
in that district.

1471
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,510
As you know, i can't
discuss with you

1472
01:15:14,545 --> 01:15:17,012
what happened
on the jury...

1473
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:19,014
but i do want
to tell you...

1474
01:15:19,049 --> 01:15:21,016
is muriel heatherly still
playing the lead with you?

1475
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,017
Yes.

1476
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,020
I do think
she's such a good actress.

1477
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,522
Don't you?

1478
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:28,941
Miss baring...

1479
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:30,943
you remember
our meeting?

1480
01:15:30,978 --> 01:15:32,444
Oh, yes.

1481
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,946
You do remember.

1482
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,948
Of course.

1483
01:15:35,983 --> 01:15:37,449
Very well.

1484
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,452
You see...

1485
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,955
if i hadn't sent
you away on tour

1486
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,456
to get experience...

1487
01:15:44,491 --> 01:15:46,959
you wouldn't be
in this position now.

1488
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,461
That's, in a way,

1489
01:15:49,496 --> 01:15:50,963
why i feel...

1490
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:52,464
sort of...

1491
01:15:52,499 --> 01:15:54,466
responsibility.

1492
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:55,968
That's why i've come

1493
01:15:56,003 --> 01:15:57,469
there might be...

1494
01:15:57,504 --> 01:15:59,972
there must be some
grounds for an appeal.

1495
01:16:04,343 --> 01:16:06,728
I knew that would happen.

1496
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:09,731
I knew someone would try
and get me off

1497
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:11,733
and think they were
doing me a kindness.

1498
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,435
Imprisonment for life.

1499
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,523
Why, a week of it's
nearly driven me crazy.

1500
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:24,529
If they want to do
the other thing...

1501
01:16:24,564 --> 01:16:27,032
they can.

1502
01:16:27,532 --> 01:16:30,035
I thought it
and got over it.

1503
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,372
Except at night...

1504
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:37,376
it'll be no worse
than the dentist.

1505
01:16:37,411 --> 01:16:39,127
And if i have done
this thing,

1506
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:42,431
as they say i have,

1507
01:16:42,466 --> 01:16:45,434
i'm better out
of the way.

1508
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:48,687
As for the other thing,

1509
01:16:48,722 --> 01:16:51,523
if you're a friend to me,
you couldn't do it.

1510
01:16:51,558 --> 01:16:54,026
Lock yourself up
in your own room...

1511
01:16:54,061 --> 01:16:55,527
for one day.

1512
01:16:55,562 --> 01:16:57,896
Only for one day and see.

1513
01:16:57,931 --> 01:17:01,283
Tell me what
i want to know,

1514
01:17:01,318 --> 01:17:03,652
i'll have you out
of here altogether.

1515
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:07,990
What is that?

1516
01:17:08,025 --> 01:17:08,991
I can tell you.

1517
01:17:09,026 --> 01:17:10,993
Tell me
the name of the man

1518
01:17:11,028 --> 01:17:13,128
discussed by you
and edna druce.

1519
01:17:13,163 --> 01:17:16,131
I've said
so many times before.

1520
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:19,134
He has no connection
with the case.

1521
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:20,636
Besides,

1522
01:17:20,671 --> 01:17:22,638
i didn't quarrel.

1523
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,641
I'll tell you now.

1524
01:17:25,676 --> 01:17:29,144
Edna druce tried to say
poisonous things about him.

1525
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,147
And i just put
my fingers in my ears

1526
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,650
and kept them there.

1527
01:17:34,685 --> 01:17:37,152
So that you actually
couldn't hear a sound.

1528
01:17:37,187 --> 01:17:39,154
You couldn't have hear
d of any other person

1529
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:40,656
that had come
into the room.

1530
01:17:40,691 --> 01:17:43,158
No. I suppose i couldn't.

1531
01:17:43,193 --> 01:17:45,661
Why wouldn't
you listen to her?

1532
01:17:45,696 --> 01:17:47,663
Because...

1533
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,668
i knew what edna was
trying to tell me.

1534
01:17:52,703 --> 01:17:55,170
What was she trying
to tell you?

1535
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,674
I can't answer that.

1536
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,176
It involved...

1537
01:18:01,211 --> 01:18:02,177
somebody else.

1538
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,595
Plenty of other people

1539
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,597
have been involved
in this case.

1540
01:18:05,632 --> 01:18:08,100
Markham, stewart,
druce... fane.

1541
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,053
Why shouldn't this one
man's name be known?

1542
01:18:11,088 --> 01:18:13,138
There was something...

1543
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:16,141
something he daren't
have known.

1544
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:18,643
But which you knew.

1545
01:18:18,678 --> 01:18:20,145
Yes.

1546
01:18:20,645 --> 01:18:21,646
What was it?

1547
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:27,652
You realize
what you're admitting

1548
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:29,654
by your silence?

1549
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:33,658
You're shielding
this man

1550
01:18:33,693 --> 01:18:35,544
because you know you'r
e in love with him.

1551
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:38,413
Oh, but that's impossible.

1552
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,415
Impossible? Why should
it be impossible?

1553
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,919
I see no reason why it
should be impossible.

1554
01:18:43,954 --> 01:18:45,921
Why, the man's
a half-caste.

1555
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:49,424
What's that?

1556
01:18:49,459 --> 01:18:50,926
What did you say?

1557
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:53,428
A half-caste?

1558
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:55,814
Black blood.

1559
01:18:55,849 --> 01:18:58,066
Why haven't you
said so much?

1560
01:18:58,101 --> 01:18:59,568
Tell me the rest.

1561
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:01,069
What was his name?

1562
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,439
I won't tell you that.

1563
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:05,774
Ever.

1564
01:19:05,809 --> 01:19:07,776
Will this help you
to remember the name

1565
01:19:07,811 --> 01:19:09,778
of the man you were
quarelling about?

1566
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,279
Stewart's
cigarette case?

1567
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:14,666
That's not one
of stewart's things.

1568
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:15,951
Things?

1569
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:18,453
You mustn't give the
prisoner anything here, sir.

1570
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:19,955
And the time
for the interview

1571
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,957
has nearly ended, sir.

1572
01:19:21,992 --> 01:19:22,958
Oh, sir john.

1573
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:23,959
Please.

1574
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:25,961
For these last
few moments,

1575
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,463
let's talk
about something else.

1576
01:19:28,498 --> 01:19:30,465
Yes.

1577
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,972
There was a photograph
of me in your room.

1578
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:38,473
How did you know?

1579
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:40,976
I went there
to make inquiries.

1580
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:42,978
How did you
come to get it?

1581
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,981
I've always been
keen on the stage

1582
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:49,484
ever since i was
a little girl.

1583
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:51,486
One has one's heroes.

1584
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,990
That's why i came
to you for a job.

1585
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,492
And i sent you away.

1586
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:02,497
Oh, let's talk
some more quickly.

1587
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:05,000
Diana, i...

1588
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,504
miss mitcham sent me
some of my things.

1589
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:11,506
Your photograph with them.

1590
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:14,009
I've got it in my cell now

1591
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:15,510
they let us keep some...

1592
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:17,012
come. Time's up please.

1593
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,519
Good-bye.

1594
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,522
I'm going
to find fane.

1595
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:33,578
Handel fane.

1596
01:20:33,613 --> 01:20:34,579
Handel fane.
Handel fane.

1597
01:20:34,614 --> 01:20:35,580
Handel fane?

1598
01:20:35,615 --> 01:20:36,948
What's become
of handel fane?

1599
01:20:36,983 --> 01:20:39,334
Any news of fane
yet, markham?

1600
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:41,703
Not yet, sir john.

1601
01:20:41,738 --> 01:20:43,421
I'm trying some more
of the agents though.

1602
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:44,923
Haven't you found
fane yet, ted?

1603
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:46,424
I can't bear
the suspense.

1604
01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:47,876
We shall be up all
night, you know.

1605
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,378
Oh, for god's sake.

1606
01:20:50,413 --> 01:20:52,380
Hello? Hello?

1607
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:54,132
Hello? Is that
lambersee agents?

1608
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:56,601
Yes. You found fane yet?

1609
01:20:56,636 --> 01:20:59,221
He's wanted for an
important job, you know.

1610
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:01,022
Yes, at once.
What's that?

1611
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:03,275
Gone back
to his old job?

1612
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:05,810
What? Trapeeze artist?

1613
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:08,113
Under what name?

1614
01:21:08,148 --> 01:21:10,115
Where?

1615
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,650
No, can't stop now.

1616
01:21:11,685 --> 01:21:13,034
Got him at last.

1617
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,959
Yes, that's him all right.

1618
01:21:21,995 --> 01:21:23,962
Dressed up as a woman, eh?

1619
01:21:23,997 --> 01:21:26,464
Always was good at that.

1620
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,967
An extremely clever
way of hiding.

1621
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,470
Markham?

1622
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:33,972
Yes, sir?

1623
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:35,473
I've an idea.

1624
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:38,977
You know yourhamlet?

1625
01:21:39,012 --> 01:21:40,979
Every line of it, sir.

1626
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,982
Then let me suggest
for your consideration

1627
01:21:44,017 --> 01:21:46,985
the series of events
embodied in act 3, scene 2.

1628
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,988
That's the play scene,
isn't it, sir?

1629
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,991
Yes. The play scene.

1630
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:54,993
Do you remember
the title...

1631
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:55,994
the mousetrap?

1632
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:57,996
Yes.

1633
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,498
Well, when he comes
to my theatre

1634
01:22:00,533 --> 01:22:03,001
to read a part
i shall offer him,

1635
01:22:03,036 --> 01:22:04,502
s.
There'll be 3 of u

1636
01:22:04,537 --> 01:22:07,005
2 cats to one mouse.

1637
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:10,508
Yes, but what
about the cheese, sir?

1638
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,512
The cheese, yes.

1639
01:22:14,547 --> 01:22:17,015
The cheese will be
a fat part, markham.

1640
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,018
A villain's part
in the blood and thunder

1641
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:23,521
in a play that i'm going t
o write especially for him.

1642
01:22:23,556 --> 01:22:28,026
A play based on a recent
well-known murder case.

1643
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:31,029
I imagine he will
play his part,

1644
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:34,032
as i hope we shall
convince him...

1645
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:35,533
to the life.

1646
01:23:03,263 --> 01:23:04,429
Come in.

1647
01:23:04,929 --> 01:23:06,431
Can you give me
a minute?

1648
01:23:06,466 --> 01:23:08,316
Certainly.

1649
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:11,319
Oh. Who is that
you have with you?

1650
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,825
Of course, i remember.

1651
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,827
This is the gentleman
you suggested.

1652
01:23:18,862 --> 01:23:20,779
Yes, sir john.
Mr. Handel fane.

1653
01:23:20,814 --> 01:23:23,281
Oh, yes.
Do come in?

1654
01:23:25,283 --> 01:23:26,284
How do you do?

1655
01:23:26,785 --> 01:23:27,786
How do you do?

1656
01:23:27,821 --> 01:23:28,787
Sit down.

1657
01:23:35,794 --> 01:23:37,295
Here you are.

1658
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:38,797
Oh, thank you.

1659
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,353
Oh.

1660
01:23:49,808 --> 01:23:52,310
Thank you.

1661
01:23:52,345 --> 01:23:54,312
No, bennett, don't go.

1662
01:23:54,813 --> 01:23:56,314
I may need you.

1663
01:23:57,816 --> 01:24:00,819
You see, i always conduct
these interviews so badly,

1664
01:24:00,854 --> 01:24:02,821
i'm just as likely
as not to leave out

1665
01:24:02,856 --> 01:24:04,823
the really important points.

1666
01:24:04,858 --> 01:24:08,326
Now, i suppose i better
begin by an explanation.

1667
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:10,328
I dare say
mr. Bennett has told you

1668
01:24:10,363 --> 01:24:11,830
the author of the play?

1669
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,832
No, sir john.
I understand you wish

1670
01:24:13,867 --> 01:24:16,334
that to be kept a secret
for the time being.

1671
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:18,336
Well, i wrote the play.

1672
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:19,838
That was a simple matter,

1673
01:24:19,873 --> 01:24:21,339
but it's proving
astonishingly difficult

1674
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,342
to find the right person
for one particular part.

1675
01:24:25,844 --> 01:24:27,846
Might i ask you to stand
up for one moment?

1676
01:24:28,346 --> 01:24:29,347
Of course.

1677
01:24:34,352 --> 01:24:36,855
You know, bennett,
he looks it.

1678
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,857
He looks it
quite perfectly.

1679
01:24:39,357 --> 01:24:41,860
Exactly what i've
been thinking, sir john.

1680
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:44,362
Would you mind...
oh, sit down, do.

1681
01:24:46,364 --> 01:24:48,867
Would you mind reading
one or 2 lines?

1682
01:24:48,902 --> 01:24:50,368
You know, just
to give me some idea?

1683
01:24:50,869 --> 01:24:51,870
Of course.

1684
01:24:51,905 --> 01:24:53,371
Oh, i say, bennett,
this is quite illegible.

1685
01:24:53,406 --> 01:24:54,873
Tell... what's his name...
baldwin to bring me

1686
01:24:55,373 --> 01:24:56,875
a clean copy of act 3.

1687
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:57,876
Thank you.

1688
01:25:00,879 --> 01:25:02,380
Sir john?

1689
01:25:02,415 --> 01:25:04,382
Might i ask you...

1690
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:07,886
what kind of play
is this exactly?

1691
01:25:07,921 --> 01:25:10,388
Well, you may
question my taste,

1692
01:25:10,423 --> 01:25:11,890
but as an artist,

1693
01:25:11,925 --> 01:25:13,391
you'll understand
my temptation.

1694
01:25:19,397 --> 01:25:21,399
My subject, mr. Fane,

1695
01:25:21,434 --> 01:25:24,402
is the inner history
of the baring case.

1696
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:31,409
Ohh. Thank you.

1697
01:25:31,444 --> 01:25:33,411
Really? Your...

1698
01:25:33,446 --> 01:25:35,413
your indifference
astonishes me.

1699
01:25:36,915 --> 01:25:37,916
Aren't i right
in thinking

1700
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,417
that you were a member

1701
01:25:39,452 --> 01:25:41,419
of the druce company
at the time?

1702
01:25:41,454 --> 01:25:42,420
Yes, that is so.

1703
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:44,389
Then you knew
both women concerned.

1704
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,891
Yes, i knew them
both quite well.

1705
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,855
Now, let's begin.

1706
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:04,359
Oh, by the way,
mr. Fane,

1707
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:06,327
i understand you're
appearing at present

1708
01:26:06,362 --> 01:26:08,830
at the circus.
Would that interfere?

1709
01:26:08,865 --> 01:26:10,331
No, it was my old job,

1710
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:12,333
it
and i've gone back to

1711
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:14,335
because times have been
a little difficult and...

1712
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,254
ng however, i understand
you wouldn't be starti

1713
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:18,256
for 2 or 3 weeks.

1714
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,258
No, i don't suppose so, no.

1715
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:27,265
Let me give you...

1716
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:29,267
some idea of the scene.

1717
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:34,772
Here is a table in front
of a fireplace,

1718
01:26:34,807 --> 01:26:36,774
more or less a visage.

1719
01:26:36,809 --> 01:26:40,778
On the table there's
the remains of a meal.

1720
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,149
And, of course,
the brandy flask.

1721
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:48,036
You know, mr. Fane,

1722
01:26:48,071 --> 01:26:51,039
of course, you know all
the details of the case.

1723
01:26:51,074 --> 01:26:52,540
,
i can't help wondering

1724
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:54,542
why nothing
spectacular developed

1725
01:26:54,577 --> 01:26:57,045
in connection
with the brandy.

1726
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,048
Thinking as a dramatist,

1727
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:02,550
i can't help feeling
that the brandy

1728
01:27:02,585 --> 01:27:05,553
was not exploited with
sufficient imagination.

1729
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,056
Then, of course,

1730
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:11,009
the law has no sense
of drama, has it?

1731
01:27:11,509 --> 01:27:12,010
No.

1732
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:13,011
No.

1733
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:17,015
Then again,
let me see.

1734
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,016
I'm afraid I...

1735
01:27:18,051 --> 01:27:21,019
i thought it best
to begin from a point

1736
01:27:21,054 --> 01:27:23,021
just before
the actual murder.

1737
01:27:29,527 --> 01:27:33,031
There's a short scene
between the 2 women...

1738
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:36,034
which turns
into a quarrel.

1739
01:27:36,069 --> 01:27:37,952
In the middle of it,

1740
01:27:37,987 --> 01:27:39,454
you make your entrance,

1741
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:41,956
on the words... i got
this from the evidence...

1742
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:43,958
on the words...

1743
01:27:43,993 --> 01:27:46,878
"friends? I can tell you
things about your friends

1744
01:27:46,913 --> 01:27:48,212
that you don't know. "

1745
01:27:49,547 --> 01:27:51,966
Just carry on from
that point, would you?

1746
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:03,478
Now, how on earth
did you know

1747
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:06,481
the entrance was
from the window?

1748
01:28:06,516 --> 01:28:07,949
That's highly clever.

1749
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,369
And look, mr. Fane,

1750
01:28:11,404 --> 01:28:13,371
you've forgotten
your script.

1751
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:22,413
The script.

1752
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,004
Now, where are we?

1753
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:31,506
Ah, yes.

1754
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:35,009
"Friends? I can tell
you things... "

1755
01:28:35,044 --> 01:28:37,512
wouldn't it be better if
i were to pick up the poker

1756
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:39,013
from the back fireplace

1757
01:28:39,048 --> 01:28:41,516
before i made the entrance
to the room?

1758
01:28:48,606 --> 01:28:51,242
Excellent idea.
I'll put that in.

1759
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,033
Thank you.

1760
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:03,287
May i have the poker?

1761
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,043
No, i'm terribly sorry

1762
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:10,878
we only have
electric fires here.

1763
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,265
Would this pencil do?

1764
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,115
Very well.

1765
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,117
We must get on
without the poker.

1766
01:29:33,152 --> 01:29:35,069
You can use
your imagination, eh?

1767
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,573
Now then...

1768
01:29:38,608 --> 01:29:40,575
through the window,

1769
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:42,076
into the room.

1770
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,080
You creep through
the double doors.

1771
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:50,084
The 2 women are
facing each other.

1772
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:51,085
You come slowly around,

1773
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,087
taking care
not to be heard

1774
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,089
and gradually you
approach the one

1775
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,592
whose back is to you.

1776
01:29:57,627 --> 01:30:00,595
Now, you raise the poker
that is in your hand

1777
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,097
as the other woman
says...

1778
01:30:03,132 --> 01:30:07,602
"you fool! Don't you know
that he's a half... "

1779
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,130
what a pity, sir john.

1780
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:38,633
The scene isn't finished.

1781
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:45,139
I was getting quite
worked up to it.

1782
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:54,649
I thought perhaps...

1783
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,150
mr. Fane...

1784
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:59,153
you might be able
to collaborate with us.

1785
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,145
I'm so sorry, sir john.

1786
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:30,151
I'm afraid i understand
so little about playwriting.

1787
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:37,658
Perhaps later on...

1788
01:31:37,693 --> 01:31:40,161
when the script
is finished...

1789
01:31:40,196 --> 01:31:44,165
you'll allow me to giv
e you another reading.

1790
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:17,148
Find out what time
fane comes on tonight.

1791
01:32:37,835 --> 01:32:39,837
I shan't be...

1792
01:32:57,855 --> 01:32:59,857
How do you do, sir john?

1793
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,861
Markham.

1794
01:33:04,362 --> 01:33:07,365
Who'd have thought
of seeing you here?

1795
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,367
Well, you see,
i'm, uh...

1796
01:33:09,402 --> 01:33:11,869
i'm working fo
r sir john now.

1797
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:14,372
Yes. Mr. Markham
is helping me

1798
01:33:14,407 --> 01:33:15,873
with my new play.

1799
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,545
I suppose
you find brandy

1800
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:23,347
steadying
for the nerves?

1801
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:27,351
Mine's very nerving work,
you see, sir john?

1802
01:33:27,386 --> 01:33:29,353
You never know
what may happen.

1803
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,356
Hurry up. You're next.

1804
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:37,361
I presume you've come
to talk to me about...

1805
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:40,364
that part again, sir john.

1806
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,867
R. You know perfectly
well what i've come here fo

1807
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:44,869
Hurry up, fane.

1808
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:45,870
There'll be a wait

1809
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:47,371
if you're
not careful.

1810
01:33:47,406 --> 01:33:48,372
If it isn't...

1811
01:33:48,407 --> 01:33:49,874
how are you,
sir john?

1812
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:51,876
Come to see
the show?

1813
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:53,878
No, not exactly.

1814
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:56,380
I've really come
to see mr. Fane.

1815
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:01,886
Sir john,
if you wouldn't mind

1816
01:34:01,921 --> 01:34:04,388
coming down to see me
after my act,

1817
01:34:04,423 --> 01:34:05,890
i shall only
be too pleased

1818
01:34:05,925 --> 01:34:07,391
to talk over
that little matter

1819
01:34:07,426 --> 01:34:08,392
we were discussing.

1820
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,710
For god's sakes,
play something!

1821
01:39:41,925 --> 01:39:43,427
Uh...

1822
01:39:43,462 --> 01:39:45,429
fane says he has
decided to colloborate

1823
01:39:45,929 --> 01:39:48,432
in my play after all.

1824
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:50,434
He says...

1825
01:39:50,934 --> 01:39:52,936
"the 2 women
are standing

1826
01:39:52,971 --> 01:39:55,439
"facing each other
in dead silence.

1827
01:39:55,474 --> 01:39:58,442
"They are so lost in the
tension of the moment

1828
01:39:58,477 --> 01:40:00,944
"that they do not hear
the murderer creep through

1829
01:40:00,979 --> 01:40:02,946
"the double doors
into the room.

1830
01:40:03,447 --> 01:40:04,448
"The murdered woman
is at that instant

1831
01:40:04,948 --> 01:40:05,449
"going to speak.

1832
01:40:05,949 --> 01:40:08,952
"The murderer
springs forward.

1833
01:40:08,987 --> 01:40:11,455
"He hurls
the first woman aside.

1834
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,956
"She is stunned
by the fall,

1835
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:14,458
"but he doesn't
notice it.

1836
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:15,959
"Infuriated,

1837
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:17,961
"he strikes out
at the other woman

1838
01:40:18,462 --> 01:40:19,463
"with the poker.

1839
01:40:19,498 --> 01:40:21,965
"She falls
by the fireplace,

1840
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,967
"she's dead.

1841
01:40:24,468 --> 01:40:26,970
"He nearly faints
at the sight of the blood.

1842
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:29,473
"He drinks the brandy,

1843
01:40:29,508 --> 01:40:32,476
"then he sees the other
woman beginning to stir.

1844
01:40:32,511 --> 01:40:33,977
"He must get away...

1845
01:40:34,012 --> 01:40:35,479
"through
the back window.

1846
01:40:35,979 --> 01:40:36,980
"A leap or two.

1847
01:40:37,015 --> 01:40:40,484
Finally, a climb into
the theatre dressing room. "

1848
01:40:40,984 --> 01:40:43,487
That accounts
for the broken basin.

1849
01:40:43,522 --> 01:40:46,990
"But how to get home
undetected from the theatre.

1850
01:40:47,025 --> 01:40:48,492
"An idea.

1851
01:40:48,992 --> 01:40:51,495
The policeman's unifor
m he wore on the stage. "

1852
01:40:51,995 --> 01:40:53,997
There's your policeman
, markham.

1853
01:40:54,498 --> 01:40:56,500
"He walks home
a murderer.

1854
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,002
"A murderer
on an impulse.

1855
01:40:59,037 --> 01:41:01,004
"The silence of
the mouth of a woman

1856
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:03,507
"who knew his secret and
was going to reveal it

1857
01:41:04,007 --> 01:41:06,009
"to the woman
he dared to love.

1858
01:41:06,044 --> 01:41:08,011
There's a melodrama
for you, sir john. "

1859
01:41:10,013 --> 01:41:12,015
Well, markham...

1860
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:14,518
you have it all.

1861
01:41:14,553 --> 01:41:17,020
Poor devil.

1862
01:41:17,055 --> 01:41:19,022
And diana baring...

1863
01:41:19,057 --> 01:41:21,525
she knew all the time...

1864
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,026
he was a half-caste.
