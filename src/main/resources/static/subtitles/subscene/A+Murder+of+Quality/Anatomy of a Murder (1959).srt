1
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,130
Hi, Toybull.

2
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,498
Hey, your pal just drove
into town, Mr. McCarthy.

3
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,440
I'll have one more, Toybull.

4
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,745
I'm afraid I'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

5
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,871
You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.

6
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,882
Thank you, Toybull.

7
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,847
Good night, Toybull.

8
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,482
Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

9
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,039
Operator,

10
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,417
Operator, I want...

11
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,648
489 Thunder Bay.

12
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,055
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

13
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,354
M-A-N-I-O-N.

14
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,520
This is Paul Biegler speaking.

15
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,655
Iron City 700.

16
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,508
- Do they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't,

17
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,641
I see. Just leave a message.
Tell her to call this number.

18
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,446
Thank you.

19
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,185
- What do you say there, counselor?
- Save your money.

20
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,195
What's in the brown paper bag?

21
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,527
It might be a cabbage head.

22
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,533
Bet it wouldn't be.

23
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,332
You're a very suspicious man.

24
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,643
True, I'm everlastingly
suspicious of...

25
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,146
and/or fascinated by...

26
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,217
the contents of brown paper bags.

27
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,685
- Shall I sneak a peek?
- You do that, counselor.

28
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,289
You do that.

29
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,987
After you sneak a peek, why, you...

30
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,462
uncork whatever you find.

31
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,671
- Shall I pour?
- Be a privilege.

32
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,673
My pleasure, sir.

33
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,276
You fought this soldier by yourself.

34
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,550
You've been drinking alone, Paulie.

35
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,716
I don't like that.

36
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,989
Drop the stone, counselor.
You live in a glass house.

37
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:41,258
My windows have been busted long ago,
so I can say as I please.

38
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,928
Have an Italian cigar?

39
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,199
No, thanks.

40
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,572
Those stinkweeds are another sign
of your decadence.

41
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,506
Paulie, it's a fact.

42
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,018
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out of
the office of public prosecutor...

43
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,918
you haven't been worth
salt for peanuts.

44
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,184
Not that I don't understand
how you feel.

45
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,322
A man gets beat out of an office
he's held for a long time...

46
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,997
he feels his community
has deserted him.

47
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,365
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.

48
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,462
None but the lonely hearts
shall know my anguish.

49
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,633
Paulie, you're a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

50
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,541
Be here ready for clients,
not out fishing and playing that...

51
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,443
rooty-tooty jazz.

52
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,311
Oh, I'm making a living.

53
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,384
I run a few abstracts...

54
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,477
how to divorceJane Doe
from John Doe every once in a while.

55
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,182
Threaten a few deadbeats.

56
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,158
And in the evening,
I sit around and drink bourbon whisky...

57
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,219
and read law
with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy...

58
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,697
one of the world's great men.

59
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,564
That was a kind word, Paulie.

60
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,433
You know...

61
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,438
I might have been.

62
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,670
That's one of the reasons I hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

63
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,212
I look at you, and I see myself
years ago...

64
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,306
with the same love for the smell
of the old brown books...

65
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,510
and the dusty office.

66
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,780
Here's the rose.

67
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,257
A lily.
A sweet lupine.

68
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,693
The United States
Supreme Court reports.

69
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,692
Well...

70
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,360
what shall we read
this evening, counselor?

71
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,336
How about a little
ChiefJustice Holmes?

72
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,705
Keep ChiefJustice on hold for a moment.
I might have a client.

73
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,304
- Waiting for a call. Hello?
- Mr, Biegler?

74
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,542
- This is Paul Biegler speaking.
- It's your party,

75
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,881
- Hello? Mrs. Manion?
- What?

76
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,614
Mr, Biegler?

77
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,054
I'm sorry I missed you a while ago.
Did you get my message?

78
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,648
- Who is that? What is that name?
-Just a minute, please.

79
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,285
We seem to have a bad connection.
Hold on.

80
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,763
It's a woman, name of Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

81
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,731
- In Thunder Bay?
- Uh-huh.

82
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,666
If she wants you to represent
her husband, say yes.

83
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,171
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

84
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,639
- Hello?
- Mr, Biegler?

85
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,075
Oh, yes. This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

86
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,874
I've waited for your call
all afternoon.

87
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,882
Yes, well, I just got in
a few moments ago,

88
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,509
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

89
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,985
Yes.

90
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,057
Mr, Biegler, have you read
about my husband? Muffy, please,

91
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,925
Well, uh, yes, I have, a little.

92
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,328
- Will you defend him?
- I don't know.

93
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,595
- I'd have to know more about it.
- Will you talk to him?

94
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,603
Mr. Biegler, he's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?

95
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,539
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.

96
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,371
I have?

97
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,640
Yes, someone told him about you,
Will you see him?

98
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,545
I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

99
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,946
- Would you want me there too?
- I think that'd be fiine,

100
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,319
Let's make it about 10:00.

101
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,892
Thank you,
Thank you so much,

102
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,291
Yes, you're quite welcome.
Bye.

103
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,987
Now, what's this all about?

104
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,123
A man named Barney Quill
raped Mrs. Manion.

105
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,463
Her husband, he's a lieutenant
in the army...

106
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,436
there's a temporary base in Thunder Bay,
a gunnery or something...

107
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:11,238
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Mr. Quill about five times...

108
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,177
which causes Mr. Quill to promptly die
of lead poisoning.

109
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,180
- When did this happen?
- A couple of nights ago.

110
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,944
If you hadn't been out fishing
in some godforsaken backwater...

111
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,951
you'd have known about it.

112
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,323
- Morning, Maida.
- Oh, there it is.

113
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,331
- What?
- The newspaper.

114
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,698
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.
We haven't paid the bill.

115
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,567
- Did you get my note?
- Uh-huh. We may be on the case.

116
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,903
I'm just reading up on it now
before talking to Lt. Manion.

117
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,772
Doesn't he ever go home?

118
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,869
Oh, you mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.

119
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,743
Is that a fact?

120
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,148
I think maybe you better cancel
all my appointments for today.

121
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,915
What appointments? People think
you've migrated into the woods.

122
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,923
If this refrigerator gets any more
fish in it, it'll swim upstream...

123
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,258
and spawn all by itself.

124
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,590
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

125
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,432
I was going over
your checkbook yesterday.

126
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,666
I can't pay me my salary.

127
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,243
What did you do with the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

128
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,643
Help salt a uranium mine
or something?

129
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,479
- Bought a few bare necessities.
- Like a new outboard motor.

130
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,748
I wish I could be classed
as a necessity.

131
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,256
- Aren't you gonna have your toast?
- No, no, I'll, uh...

132
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,794
I'll call you,
let you know how things are going.

133
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,386
Don't let him pay you off
in Purple Hearts.

134
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,092
Those professional soldiers
never have a dime.

135
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,794
I ought to know.
I was married to one.

136
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,622
Beg your pardon.
Are you Mrs. Manion?

137
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,024
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

138
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,062
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

139
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,432
- This is Muff.
- Oh, Muff.

140
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,434
The jail's right here.

141
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,129
You're tall.

142
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,302
- Hello, Paulie!
- Hi, Sulo.

143
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,313
You wait here, Muffy.

144
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,254
- Good to see you, Paulie.
- How you feeling?

145
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,119
Fine. I guess you come
for the soldier boy.

146
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,989
Yeah. Do you think it'd be all right
if we talk in the sheriff s office?

147
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,153
Oh, sure, Paulie.
I'll bring him down.

148
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,068
Would you mind taking
your glasses off, Mrs. Manion?

149
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,181
Did Barney Quill do that to you?

150
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,250
Mm-hmm. More than that.

151
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,251
You should see. All over.

152
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,082
You can put them back on
if it's more comfortable for you.

153
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,130
This is Paulie Biegler.
This is the bucko, Paulie.

154
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,569
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Manny.

155
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,572
Hello, Laura.

156
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,675
Mrs. Manion, can you meet me down in
my office about 2:00 this afternoon?

157
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,806
It's 305 West Barnham.

158
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,942
- Of course.
- Fine.

159
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,646
Is there anything
I can get you, hon?

160
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,655
I'm all right, hon.

161
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,986
Right in here.

162
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,103
Wanted. The big ten.

163
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,310
They got the ten best-dressed dames...

164
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,848
the ten top teams,
the ten top tunes...

165
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,678
and now the ten most wanted.

166
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:23,050
Don't knock it. That's the American
dream. Those boys made the grade.

167
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,454
You were the...

168
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,583
district attorney around here,
weren't you?

169
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,753
Ten years.

170
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,888
What's your experience
as a defense lawyer?

171
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,798
- Not very much.
- How do I know you can handle my case?

172
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,803
I guess you don't know.

173
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,873
Shall we talk about it?

174
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,408
I suppose so.

175
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,144
Come on, Lieutenant.
Don't be so bored.

176
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,614
It might very well be that no lawyer
can handle your case...

177
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,912
if you mean
getting you off scot-free.

178
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,216
You seemed to be forgetting
Barney Quill raped my wife.

179
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,416
I have the unwritten law
on my side.

180
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,289
The unwritten law's a myth,
Lieutenant.

181
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,090
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law.

182
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,166
And anyone who commits a murder
on the theory that it does exist...

183
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,361
has just bought himself room and board
in the state penitentiary.

184
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,199
Maybe for life.

185
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,300
Now, with that in mind,
perhaps we can proceed with a...

186
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,878
few questions and answers that...

187
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,141
That, uh...
Can I borrow your lighter?

188
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,515
We can proceed with a few questions and
answers that might help your defense.

189
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,293
But it probably won't be.

190
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,594
Yes. Nice lighter.

191
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,402
- Okay.
- How old are you?

192
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,973
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?

193
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,065
Since '50.

194
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,736
- You see any action?
- Korea.

195
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,212
- Have any decorations?
- Plenty.

196
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,876
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.

197
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,011
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.

198
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,182
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

199
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,783
- Is this necessary?
- I'll be the judge of that.

200
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,789
My first wife divorced me.

201
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,629
Charged cruelty.

202
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,466
Eating crackers in bed.
You know, the usual stuff.

203
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,096
Truth was...

204
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,732
she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

205
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,345
I met Laura four years ago
in Georgia.

206
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,974
We were married
right after her divorce.

207
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,553
Did you know the husband?

208
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,920
- He was in my outfit down there.
- You mean, you were buddies?

209
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,426
I'll withdraw the question.
It's a little old-fashioned.

210
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,056
Have there been any children
by or from any of these marriages?

211
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,363
- No.
- Any present prospects?

212
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,733
Not unless Barney Quill
started something.

213
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,999
What kind of a gun did you use?

214
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,440
War souvenir. A Luger.
The police have it now.

215
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,672
I suppose you've read the newspapers,
the stories about your case.

216
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,477
- Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?

217
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,678
And you didn't see Quill rape
and beat your wife?

218
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,846
No. No.

219
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,288
When she got back...

220
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,360
to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

221
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,259
And how long was it before you went
over to Quill's and killed him?

222
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,228
I don't know exactly.
Maybe an hour.

223
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,766
That long, huh?

224
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,326
The newspapers say that your wife
volunteered to take a lie detector test.

225
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,839
- Do you know anything about this?
- Only what I read and what she told me.

226
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,467
Do you know how
the lie detector test turned out?

227
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,977
They didn't tell her.

228
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,446
- Yes, Sulo?
- We got lunch served for the jail.

229
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,349
- You want to eat with us?
- Your sister still cook for the jail?

230
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,353
Oh, sure. She cooks.

231
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,618
Well, you give her
my compliments, Sulo.

232
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,694
I've got a luncheon date downtown.

233
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,888
- Nice going, Mr. Biegler.
- I'll be back after lunch.

234
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:56,457
Look, I'm sorry
if I offended you a while ago.

235
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,503
No, you're not.

236
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,903
Come on, bucko.

237
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,565
Thank you.

238
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,943
Pass the salt, Paulie.

239
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,173
Thank you.

240
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,942
Did you give the lieutenant
the well known lecture?

241
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,683
If you mean, did I coach him into
a phony story, no.

242
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,589
Maybe you're too pure, Paul.

243
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,460
Too pure for the natural impurities
of the law.

244
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,592
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
the chance to find a defense.

245
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,364
Could also be that you might guide him
a little, show him the way...

246
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,633
and let him decide
if he wants to take it.

247
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,266
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.

248
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,777
Anyway, I'm not the right lawyer
for this fellow.

249
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,143
He's insolent, hostile...

250
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,776
You don't have to love him.
Just defend him.

251
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,911
What's the matter?
Don't you need a fee?

252
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,888
You know something? I think
you might be a little bit afraid.

253
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,121
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

254
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,864
You know, there's only one thing more
devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

255
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,064
and that's an Irish lawyer.

256
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,697
Pass the salt.

257
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,444
Put it down.

258
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,814
- Hello there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

259
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,824
You gonna have some more jokes?

260
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,951
Not unless you want to be
the comic.

261
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,759
Oh, I brought you some cigarettes.

262
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,765
- Oh, thanks.
- Peace?

263
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,859
- Sure.
- Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...

264
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,270
there are four ways
I can defend murder.

265
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,969
Number one, it wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

266
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,070
Number two, you didn't do it. Number
three, you were legally justified...

267
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,342
like the protection of your home
or self-defense.

268
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,352
Number four,
the killing was excusable.

269
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,150
Where do I fit in
to this rosy picture?

270
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,523
I'll tell you where you don't fit in.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

271
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,530
Why? Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

272
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,293
Time element.

273
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,732
If you'd caught him in the act, the
shooting might have been justified...

274
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,805
but you didn't catch him in the act,
and you had time to bring the police...

275
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,566
and you didn't do that either.

276
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,575
You're guilty of murder...
premeditated and with vengeance.

277
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,872
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

278
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,540
- Are you telling me to plead guilty?
- When I advise a cop out, you'll know.

279
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,312
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

280
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,820
If you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me to do?

281
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,822
I'm not telling you to do anything.

282
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,018
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

283
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,425
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

284
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,397
Whatever it is you're getting at.

285
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,006
You know, you're very bright,
Lieutenant.

286
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,673
Now let's see how really bright
you can be.

287
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,048
Well, I'm working at it.

288
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,423
All right.
Now, because your wife was raped...

289
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,926
you'll have a favorable atmosphere
in the courtroom.

290
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,826
The sympathy will be with you
if all the facts are true.

291
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:17,129
What you need is a legal peg so the jury
can hang their sympathy in your behalf.

292
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,135
You follow me?

293
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,071
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

294
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:28,579
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

295
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,946
Not justification?

296
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,485
Not justification.

297
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,124
Excuse.

298
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,262
Just excuse.

299
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,747
What excuses are there?

300
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,510
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

301
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,450
- I must've been mad.
- How's that?

302
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,189
I said I must've been mad.

303
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,957
No, bad temper's no excuse.

304
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,101
I mean,
I must've been crazy.

305
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,173
Am I getting warmer?

306
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,748
Okay. See you around.

307
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,614
Am I getting warmer?

308
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,655
I'll tell you that
after I talk to your wife.

309
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,487
In the meantime, see if you can
remember just how crazy you were.

310
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,792
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?

311
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,098
She's been waiting quite a while.

312
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,402
She's been through all your albums,
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

313
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,135
What do you think of her?

314
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,974
Soft. Easy. The kind men like
to take advantage of...

315
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,809
and do.

316
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,850
Did you get any money?

317
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,044
- Money.
- Oh. Oh, no.

318
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,281
I haven't decided
to take the case yet.

319
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,881
You know, you surprise me sometimes.

320
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,893
Why? I've been around.

321
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,309
I, uh...

322
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,980
hope you don't mind.

323
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,879
I think we'd better talk.

324
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,248
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.

325
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,721
The music, I mean.

326
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,790
Aren't lawyers supposed
to like music?

327
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,451
Well, not that kind of music.

328
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Oh. I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of lawyer.

329
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,295
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?

330
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,027
Where did you go to school?
Where did you live when you were young?

331
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,400
No place in particular.
We sort of moved around.

332
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,839
My father was a construction boomer.
Building dams, mostly.

333
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,544
You can call me Laura.

334
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,880
Is your family still alive, Laura?

335
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,313
No.

336
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,680
I don't know. I have
some cigarettes around here someplace.

337
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,946
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, I want to offer you one.

338
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,454
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

339
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,191
Here.

340
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,388
That's just like your husband's.

341
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,361
He gave me this because I liked
the one he had.

342
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,131
He's like that.
He gives me presents all the time.

343
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,967
Do you have a happy marriage?

344
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,440
What went wrong
with the first marriage?

345
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,674
Well, what when wrong is
when I went for Manny.

346
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,750
Well, that's honest enough.

347
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,548
It was more than just that. Like I said,
I grew up on the move, and...

348
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,216
Jack... that was my first husband...
Jack didn't like to move.

349
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,589
He wouldn't even take a transfer
when he had the chance.

350
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,662
I was really bored.

351
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:08,324
Manny likes to go. We're always going
whenever we get the chance.

352
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,459
We've been all over.
I'm thirsty.

353
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,629
Water, or would a beer do?

354
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,400
I think a beer would do fine.

355
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,703
Maida, bring me
a bottle of beer, will you?

356
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,042
- Are you married?
- No.

357
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,546
That's nice.

358
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,449
What do you do alone in this house
if you aren't married?

359
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,284
Well, it's a family home,
and I'm the last of the family.

360
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,290
- There you are.
- Thank you.

361
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,227
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.

362
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,898
There you are.

363
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,128
Could Muff have a little
in that ashtray? He loves beer.

364
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,864
You want a beer for the dog?

365
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,941
Well, here we are.

366
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,247
He'll go to sleep now.

367
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,019
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

368
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,089
How about it?
Are you ready?

369
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,156
I mean, are you ready
to tell me the story?

370
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,161
I know what you mean.

371
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,863
Now, suppose you tell me everything
you told the state police...

372
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,903
plus everything you didn't tell
the state police.

373
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,241
- Where should I begin?
- When did you leave for Quill's bar?

374
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,801
Right after dinner.
About 8:30, I guess.

375
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,245
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range...

376
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,113
so we had dinner,
he laid down and went to sleep.

377
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,017
I hadn't been out of the trailer
all day, so...

378
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,818
I took Muff and a flashlight
and walked over to the bar.

379
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,757
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

380
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,353
- Many people in the bar?
- Mm-mm. Not many.

381
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,058
Barney came over
and challenged me to a game.

382
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,330
- For drinks, you know?
- How well did you know Barney?

383
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,100
Well, he owned this bar where
Manny and I went sometimes, that's all.

384
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,175
Had he ever made a pass at you?

385
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,574
No. Nothing like that at all.

386
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,273
Was he drinking heavily that night?

387
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,182
Didn't seem to be. At least
not when we were playing pinball.

388
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,049
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

389
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,214
No, there were other people
playing too.

390
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,814
And what time did you leave the bar?

391
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:18,327
Oh, about 11:00, I guess.

392
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,627
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

393
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,758
He carries it in his mouth.
He's so cute...

394
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,563
running along ahead
with the light shining.

395
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,662
- Was he sober?
- Muff? Of course he was sober.

396
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,468
Oh, you're joking now,
aren't you?

397
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,840
Yes, I'm joking.
Go on.

398
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,470
Well, Barney came from somewhere.

399
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,344
Not the door I left by.

400
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,248
And he said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

401
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,288
He said the bears had been prowling
around, and I oughtn't to walk home.

402
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,688
The bears come out of the woods
at night to scavenge.

403
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,760
They're harmless enough,
aren't they?

404
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,421
Yeah, I suppose I wouldn't have been
afraid in the daylight...

405
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,725
but the dark isn't the same.

406
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,825
Yes, I know. I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car...

407
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,234
I got in and he drove
straight to the trailer park.

408
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,432
- He made overtures?
- No, nothing.

409
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,533
When we got to the trailer park,
the auto gate was closed.

410
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,273
Mr. Lemon closes it
about 11:00 or a little after.

411
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,941
So I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

412
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,884
but he said that there wasn't
any need for me to walk...

413
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,785
that he could drive me into the park
on another road.

414
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,051
I didn't know
there was another road, but...

415
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,992
he drove on before
I could say yes or no.

416
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,655
- Were you alarmed?
- No.

417
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,790
I'm not usually afraid of men.

418
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,461
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

419
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,301
Well, doesn't a woman sort of
instinctively know...

420
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,965
when a fellow's on the make?

421
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,045
Oh, sure,
but that's only usual with me.

422
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,604
With men, I mean. Almost all men.
Ever since I was a kid.

423
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,150
You, for instance.
You're interested...

424
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,152
but there's no reason
to be afraid of you.

425
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,279
It was like that with Barney.

426
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,550
Well, Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least...

427
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,853
Call me Laura.

428
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:02,231
Laura, I'm only interested
in helping your husband. Nothing more.

429
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,801
I don't mean you'd try anything.

430
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,669
I just mean it's...
it's the way you look at me.

431
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,673
It would be very difficult
not to look at you.

432
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,575
Oh, the way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

433
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,444
Oh, I love it.
I just love it.

434
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,611
Now, we'd better keep moving along
with this thing.

435
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,679
Now, how were you dressed that night?

436
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,521
Oh, in a sweater like this
and a skirt.

437
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,061
And the rest... what about that?

438
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,463
Underneath? I had on a slip
and panties and a bra.

439
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,298
- No girdle?
- I don't need a girdle.

440
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,269
Do you think I do?

441
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,436
I don't know. I don't know.
How should I...

442
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,979
Look, I'm only concerned
with a few facts...

443
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,275
that might be of help to me
in the defense of your husband.

444
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,976
- That's all.
- Well, I don't wear one.

445
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,679
Okay. No girdle. Okay.

446
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,085
All right. Go on.

447
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,920
Well, he turned off the highway
into a lane in the woods...

448
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,290
and he stopped the car
and turned off the lights.

449
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,023
And then he grabbed me,
and he said...

450
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,361
"I'm going to rape you,"
just like that.

451
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,436
- Did he use those words?
- Exactly those words.

452
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,971
Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

453
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,531
I could hear little Muffy whining
outside the car all through it.

454
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,170
And Barney began to try
to get at me...

455
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,443
and I fought him off as best I could,
but he was terribly strong.

456
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,848
Did you cry out?
Did you scream?

457
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,648
Didn't seem to be much use
out there in the woods.

458
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,189
He began to shout names at me, like...

459
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,623
"Army slut" and other names.

460
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,287
And then he drew back
and hit me with his fist.

461
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,126
He hit me again,
and I didn't fight anymore.

462
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,066
I must have been only
half-conscious, but...

463
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,866
I know that he tore my panties off
and did what he wanted.

464
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,067
Now, the newspaper said
that a doctor examined you...

465
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,144
and said that he didn't think
you'd been raped.

466
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:58,011
I don't care what the doctor thought.
A woman doesn't mistake these things.

467
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,108
All right. All right.
Now, go ahead.

468
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,450
Well, I...

469
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,581
I don't know exactly what happened then.
I must've fainted. But...

470
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,887
the next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

471
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,792
Barney was driving very fast...

472
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,024
and he was breathing hard...

473
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,569
an ugly, gasping sound.

474
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,161
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

475
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,070
and he swung in by the gate
and stopped.

476
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:28,544
I opened the door to get out. Muffy
jumped out first with a flashlight.

477
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,170
Now, wait a minute.

478
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,216
I thought you said he'd thrown Muff
out of the car back in the woods.

479
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,752
Well, he did, but Muff was in the car
when we got back.

480
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,878
He must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

481
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,481
All right. You opened the door,
and Muff got out first. All right.

482
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,389
Before I could get out...

483
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,860
Barney grabbed me and said he was gonna
tear all my clothes off...

484
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,556
and attacked me again.

485
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,998
I got away and ran. I could see Muff
through an opening in the fence.

486
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,230
He was scooting back and forth
with a flashlight.

487
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,503
Barney caught me from behind,
and I fell to the ground.

488
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,442
He fell on top of me and began
to beat me again with his fists.

489
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,377
I thought he was going to kill me.

490
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:08,077
I screamed and somehow got
to my feet again and ran.

491
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,086
I went through the opening
in the fence...

492
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,214
and followed Muffy, who was running
along ahead with the flashlight.

493
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,259
And I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

494
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,420
And you didn't see Barney again?

495
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,020
Never laid eyes on him again,
dead or alive.

496
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,164
Well, I, uh...

497
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,293
I think that's enough for now.

498
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,601
I've got lots of time.
All you want.

499
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,541
- Where can I reach you?
- I'm still in Thunder Bay...

500
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,805
but I can drive down again
in the morning.

501
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,512
- Was there something else?
- No.

502
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,130
-Thanks for letting me play the records.
-Oh, you're very welcome.

503
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,136
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

504
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,110
- Who's that?
- The lady in the case.

505
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,573
- You're not going to take the case?
- I don't know.

506
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,652
That depends on what Manion
has to tell me tomorrow.

507
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,187
He's thinking things out.

508
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,348
Oh, well, that's more like it.

509
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,451
Now, if I take the case,
I want you in it.

510
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,962
Me, in a big murder case?

511
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,666
The sight of this whisky-drinking man
at the lawyer's table would ruin you.

512
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,903
I need you.

513
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,474
You mean that?

514
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,600
Why else would he say it?

515
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,173
I'd be glad to work with you
outside of the courtroom, but...

516
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,149
- not in the courtroom.
- Suit yourself about that.

517
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,186
Either way, I'm gonna have
to be able to depend on you.

518
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,123
Will you lay off the booze?

519
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,791
I don't know.

520
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,890
I don't know about that, Paulie.

521
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,026
Why don't you know?

522
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,135
Do you think I couldn't
lay off the booze?

523
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,143
Ever tried it?

524
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,010
Try it.

525
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,385
I never been on
a big murder case.

526
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,118
Not once in all my life.

527
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,456
It's up to you, Parn.

528
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,601
Will you be around tonight?

529
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,003
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be around.

530
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,777
You know, Maida, darling...

531
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,821
I might manage it.

532
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,755
I might manage to be
a real lawyer again.

533
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,026
For a little while, anyway.

534
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,830
I tried remembering.

535
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,700
There were still some pieces missing.

536
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:17,035
I remember...

537
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,508
going to Quill's bar with a gun...

538
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,978
and I remember Quill's face
behind the bar...

539
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,515
but I don't remember anything else,
not even going home.

540
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,953
Don't you remember firing the gun? Five
shots, that's a lot of noise to forget.

541
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,891
Yeah, I remember hearing shots,
but they don't seem connected with me.

542
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:42,022
They seemed far away, like
somebody else was doing the shooting.

543
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,871
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.

544
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,239
Oh, thanks.
Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

545
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:56,507
All right. Now, there's
the little matter of the fee.

546
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,741
Three thousand dollars.
That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

547
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,444
Oh, sure. More than reasonable. I'll
have to pay later. Right now I'm broke.

548
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,147
- You're what?
- I'm broke. I'm flat busted.

549
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,247
I don't have three dollars,
much less 3,000.

550
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,454
- Can you raise it?
- Oh, yes, as soon as I get out of jail.

551
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,827
But next week's payday.

552
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,730
I'll be able to give you $150...

553
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,599
and if you get me off, I'll give you
a promissory note for the rest.

554
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:24,471
All right, now suppose I don't go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee?

555
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,640
Well, I'll have to take a lawyer
the court appoints.

556
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,443
I got my defense now, right?
Insanity.

557
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,246
I think I'll stick around,
make damn sure you get off.

558
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,447
- Where do we start?
- We're going to need a psychiatrist.

559
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,122
Neither of us has any money. Do you
think the army'll stir one up for you?

560
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,560
I know a colonel in the Pentagon.
I'll write a letter.

561
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,222
Good. Do that. Sulo.

562
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,666
Where are you going now?

563
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,173
I'm going to see your wife,
for one thing.

564
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,369
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

565
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,446
That's right. I did.

566
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,707
She's a very pretty woman,
your wife.

567
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,883
A man gets used to
the way his wife looks.

568
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,715
I guess he does.
I'll see you.

569
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,538
Come on in, Paulie.
Come on in.

570
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,439
You haven't been in here
since you vacated, have you?

571
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,978
Hardly recognize the old place, huh?

572
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,742
Mary did it for me. She just finished
her decorators' course.

573
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,044
Smart girl. Very smart girl.
Look at this.

574
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,848
- A real, genuine Picasso print.
- That's very nice.

575
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:47,151
And here. Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

576
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,816
Sit right down.

577
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,854
Great, isn't it?
Good for the nerves, they say.

578
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,295
- How do you shut it off?
- Here.

579
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,390
Here we are. Feel better?

580
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,401
I feel all shook up.

581
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,804
Mitch, I just dropped in to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

582
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,037
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

583
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,340
That's a mistake.
It's open and shut.

584
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,040
Well, maybe. We'll see.

585
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,344
Judge Maitland's still in the hospital.
Maybe you'd like to agree...

586
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,477
to a continuance
until he gets back.

587
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,555
If we go with the case now,
we'll have to try before...

588
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,886
some grab-bag judge they'll send in.

589
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,357
- Me, I'd rather have Maitland.
- So would I.

590
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,521
But that'd also mean my client
would lie around in jail...

591
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,030
for another two, three months
before the trial.

592
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,762
Now, if you'll drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

593
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,566
so I can get him out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

594
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,141
You wouldn't do that
if you were still D. A.

595
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,608
I don't know. I might.

596
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,578
I might, since a big, fat
lie detector test on his wife...

597
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,047
is giving proof to the rape story.

598
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,482
- He'd have the jury with him.
- How did you know what the lie...

599
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,450
- I bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

600
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,183
Anyway, the result of a lie detector
test isn't admissible evidence.

601
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,783
- You can't use it.
- No, but it carries moral weight.

602
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,456
Mitch, I wouldn't sit
in that chair too much.

603
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,658
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.

604
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,759
I'll see you later.

605
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,779
He remembers you, Paul.
He likes you.

606
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,974
He likes the beer in my icebox.

607
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,278
What's the occasion today.
A buffalo hunt?

608
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,320
I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

609
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,447
Aren't they smart?
I think they're very smart.

610
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,616
Here, we can sit in my car.

611
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,529
Here you are.

612
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,403
Here you go, Muff.

613
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,699
Several things have occurred to me.

614
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,900
The, uh...

615
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,445
The undergarments
Barney Quill tore off...

616
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,912
Who has them now?
The police?

617
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,983
You mean my panties?

618
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,142
All right. Your panties.

619
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,083
I haven't seen them since.

620
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,918
I gave the torn skirt and sweater
to the police, and then...

621
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,652
I went with them up that lane into
the woods to look for the panties...

622
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,388
but we couldn't find anything
but my glasses.

623
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:09,057
Your glasses? You mean you were
wearing glasses through all that?

624
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,896
No, I had them
in a case in my hand.

625
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,800
I wear them for reading,
playing pinball, things like that.

626
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,339
I must have tried to get
out of the car and dropped them.

627
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,640
You might be interested to know...

628
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,203
that your lie detector test
turned out in your favor.

629
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,944
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

630
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,021
- You weren't worried about it?
- No.

631
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,351
Why should I be?

632
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,893
Would you like to have something
to worry about?

633
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,256
Silly.

634
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,592
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

635
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,299
All right.

636
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,201
All right, let's have it.

637
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,434
- Did he say something to you?
-Just enough.

638
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,443
Are you afraid of him?

639
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:00,139
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie detector test? For him?

640
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,546
Does he have reason to be jealous?

641
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,647
He was jealous
even before we were married.

642
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,226
I should've known how it would be.

643
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,194
It's funny, though.
He likes to show me off.

644
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,527
He likes me to dress
the way I do.

645
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,194
And then he gets furious
if a man pays any attention to me.

646
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,464
I've tried to leave him,
but I can't.

647
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,836
He begs, I give in.

648
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,503
Now, if you think I've forgotten
my question, I haven't.

649
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,581
- I have.
- All right.

650
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,980
Then I'll ask it again.

651
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:37,144
Does your husband have
any reason to be jealous?

652
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,246
No.

653
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,825
Not once. Not ever.

654
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,199
Hi. Like the place all right?

655
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,666
I was just looking
at these pictures.

656
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:09,261
- That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.

657
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,807
- I'm Paul Biegler. I'm...
- I know who you are.

658
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,002
I've seen you around Iron City.

659
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,976
You didn't tell me your name.

660
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,480
Paquette.
We don't open till 5:00.

661
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,106
That's all right.
I can wait.

662
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,845
I don't have the shakes yet.

663
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,547
You were on the job that night,
weren't you...

664
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,681
the night Barney Quill was killed.

665
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,089
Like the newspaper said,
I was present.

666
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,595
You were the fellow who stopped
Lt. Manion outside.

667
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,597
That's right.

668
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,827
He pointed the gun at me and said,
"You want some too, buster?"

669
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:42,337
And you said no,
because your name isn't buster.

670
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:46,967
- Wasn't anything funny about it.
- No, there wasn't. I'm sorry.

671
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,535
Where were you when Barney Quill
was killed, Mr. Paquette?

672
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,346
I gather you don't want
to talk about that night, huh?

673
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,683
That's right.
I don't want to talk about it.

674
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:02,225
You'll have to talk to me
about it in court. Why not now?

675
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,193
'Cause I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

676
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,320
Okay.

677
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:12,192
Boy, old Barney, he was kind of
a rugged character, wasn't he?

678
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:16,534
Ex-prizefighter, muscle man,
fancy with guns, and...

679
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,972
He paid his debts.
Ran a clean place.

680
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,772
- Me, I liked him.
- You run the place now?

681
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,576
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

682
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,912
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?

683
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:31,044
No, he didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

684
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,091
Oh. All right.
I wonder who's gonna inherit the place?

685
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,628
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again.

686
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,629
What's the matter with that?

687
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,757
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know what's the matter with her.

688
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,960
Mary what?

689
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,730
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

690
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,865
She's in the back booth.
We don't talk about our customers here.

691
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,409
But if we did...
which we don't...

692
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,511
That's her.
That's Mary Pilant.

693
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:12,125
- Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?
- Sure. I know the lieutenant too.

694
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,096
He's a good officer.
She's all right too.

695
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,463
Friendly. Good kid.

696
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,502
What do you know about it?
Knock it off.

697
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,504
I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.
What's the matter with that?

698
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,632
Do you want this lawyer
to get wrong ideas?

699
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,336
What chance has the lieutenant got,
Mr. McCarthy?

700
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:33,542
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

701
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,778
I'd like to help him out. I sure would.
But we're moving out.

702
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,946
The whole outfit. Berlin.

703
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:44,352
Tell me, who is this babe
at the hotel?

704
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:48,761
Name's Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

705
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,271
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

706
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:14,154
- Will you be alone?
- I'll be joined by two others.

707
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,625
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.

708
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,897
- How was the manicure?
- Ask me any questions about anybody.

709
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:33,306
- I've got all the dope.
- Can you tell me about Mary Pilant?

710
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,244
Easy. Mary Pilant may
or may not have been...

711
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,542
the mistress of the late B. Quill.

712
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,141
The manicurist is in favor
of the mistress theory...

713
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,220
but the hairdresser's against it.

714
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:48,951
However, they both agree that some sort
of hanky-panky must have been going on.

715
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,220
- To be continued.
- Menu?

716
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,057
Thank you.

717
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,129
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty.

718
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,099
What? What?

719
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,568
Anyway, there's one story
that says that...

720
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,641
Barney's wild night with Mrs. Manion
was somehow...

721
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,732
triggered by Mary Pilant.

722
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:10,711
Seems she'd been running around with
some soldier, and Barney blew his stack.

723
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:14,215
- He got tanked up and exploded.
- Is Mary Pilant local?

724
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,650
No, she's a Canadian.
Barney brought her in here...

725
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:20,382
to sort of dress up the place,
and she stayed on to manage it for him.

726
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,084
- Looks like she's done all right.
- Better than all right.

727
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,923
- She's in for the estate.
- Oh?

728
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,429
She doesn't look like a bad sort,
does she?

729
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,591
Hmm? Where?

730
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,000
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.

731
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,731
This girl right here?

732
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,037
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

733
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,377
I'm Paul Biegler,
attorney for Lt. Manion...

734
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,815
and this is Miss Rutledge
and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.

735
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,649
- How do you do.
- Could you sit with us for a minute?

736
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,780
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

737
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,425
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

738
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,724
What sort of things,
Mr. Biegler?

739
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,495
Well, like what kind of a man
your employer was, Mr. Quill.

740
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,435
- A very nice man.
- If that's true, how do you explain...

741
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,802
what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?

742
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,808
I don't know what happened
with Lt. Manion's wife...

743
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,378
so there really isn't anything
for me to explain, is there?

744
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,916
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching, Miss Pilant.

745
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,611
Barney was well liked here
by everyone, Mr. Biegler.

746
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,744
It's very generous of everyone
to overlook his faults...

747
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,153
like raping other men's wives.

748
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,458
If you'll pardon me.

749
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,120
The waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

750
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,289
Nice to have met you,
Mr. Biegler...

751
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,629
Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

752
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,767
You just drew gin, Lieutenant.

753
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,242
- Twenty.
- Manion?

754
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,242
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah.

755
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,046
This, from Washington.

756
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,951
They'll let a doctor come and testify,
but there's a string on it.

757
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,152
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

758
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,026
Doesn't the army understand that you're
in jail on a non-bailable offense?

759
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,098
That's it, as far as
the army's concerned.

760
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,963
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try and think of something.

761
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,402
Look, my wife hasn't been here
in two days. Have you seen her?

762
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:18,736
- No, not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?

763
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,776
You've got other things
to worry about, Lieutenant.

764
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,573
I'll get in touch with your wife.
I'll tell her you miss her.

765
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,580
Yeah, you tell her that.

766
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,510
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Paulie.

767
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,722
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

768
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:39,557
I'd be tearing my hair out too
if I had something like that outside.

769
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,465
Something like what outside?

770
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:48,095
You know what I mean. Something like
that running around on the loose.

771
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,709
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?

772
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:02,046
It's me, dummy. I hit my elbow
on this lousy iron bar.

773
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:06,020
You want some rubbing alcohol maybe?

774
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,216
A little bourbon might help.

775
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,794
Knock it off, buckos.

776
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,920
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

777
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,324
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got.

778
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,695
Hiya, Paulie. That's what
they call you, isn't it? Paulie?

779
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,769
That's a crazy name
for a crazy lawyer.

780
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:07,009
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- Hey, you're not splitting the scene?

781
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,415
- I mean, you're not cuttin' out?
- No, I'll be back.

782
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,440
Hi, Paulie.
Fellows, this is Manny's lawyer.

783
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,009
- Hi. How are you?
- Sit down, won't you?

784
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,476
I'm sorry, I can't right now.
Mrs. Manion...

785
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,810
may I talk to you
for a moment outside?

786
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,510
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped
the formalities a long time ago.

787
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,452
I think maybe we'd better pick 'em
up again. It's important.

788
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,887
- All right. I'll go with you.
- All right. Come on.

789
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,186
Hey. You're coming back,
aren't you?

790
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,193
What do you think?

791
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,768
See you later, Pie-Eye.

792
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,340
Okay.

793
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,478
- Did you get my phone message?
- Yeah, but I got busy.

794
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,611
Why haven't you been
to see your husband?

795
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,622
I don't see why I have
to see him every day.

796
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,919
I think it would be
a very good idea if you did.

797
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,392
All right, I'll see him every day.
Okay?

798
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,487
- No, not okay. Where's your car?
- I came with them.

799
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,658
- Mine's right over here. Come on.
- Wait. I've got friends inside.

800
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,204
- Friends or not, you're going home.
- Who do you think you are?

801
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,967
I'm the lawyer trying to beat a rap
for your husband, remember?

802
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:41,202
- What's that got to do with...
- You listen to me.

803
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,973
Until this trial's over, you're
going to be a meek little housewife...

804
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,980
with horn-rimmed spectacles...

805
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,710
and you're going to stay away
from men and juke joints...

806
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,116
and booze and pinball machines...

807
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:55,180
and you're going to wear a skirt
and low-heeled shoes and a girdle.

808
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,624
And especially a girdle.
Look, Laura...

809
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,560
believe me, I don't usually
complain of an attractive jiggle...

810
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,758
but you save that jiggle
for your husband to look at...

811
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,528
if and when
I get him out of jail.

812
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,535
Come on. Let's go.

813
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,969
I'm sorry. I really am. I wouldn't
hurt Manny's chances for anything.

814
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,976
Come on.

815
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,443
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

816
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,782
Yeah, right over here.

817
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,048
Over there's the opening in the fence
where Muffy was running...

818
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,420
back and forth with the flashlight.

819
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,320
Where's your trailer?

820
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,330
Up there on the hill.

821
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,039
This is my favorite place.

822
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:26,508
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping
I'd come out here and just sit.

823
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,712
I had to get out of that trailer.
I couldn't stand being cooped up.

824
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,956
I'm... I'm lonely, Paul.
I'm awful lonely.

825
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,792
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that, you know.

826
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,766
Maybe you were getting in
some good practice being lonely.

827
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,269
You mean you think maybe
Manny won't get off?

828
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,397
That'll be up to the jury,
and you can never tell about them.

829
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,534
If he didn't,
it'd be one way to end it.

830
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,839
No, I don't mean that.

831
00:56:56,946 --> 00:57:00,404
I may think it sometimes,
but I don't really want it.

832
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,065
Hello, sweetie.
Did you miss me?

833
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,397
Of course you missed me.

834
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,102
You wanna come in, Paul?

835
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,641
You can if you want to,
you know.

836
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,176
No thank you, Laura.

837
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,647
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun
over at that place.

838
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,380
Good night, Laura.

839
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,045
Good night.

840
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,944
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

841
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:14,046
The circuit court for the county
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

842
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,057
You can be seated.

843
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:25,390
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

844
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,130
I'm from downstate,
and I'm sitting temporarily...

845
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:32,572
while your good Judge Maitland
is recovering from a severe illness.

846
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,769
There's no need to dwell
at length upon my methods.

847
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,677
One judge is quite like another.

848
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:42,512
The only difference is maybe
in the state of their digestions...

849
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:46,020
or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

850
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,455
For myself,
I can digest pig iron.

851
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,891
And while I might appear
to doze occasionally...

852
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,555
you'll find that
I'm easily awakened...

853
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:58,100
particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer...

854
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,862
with a nice point of law.

855
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,235
We will now take up
the criminal docket.

856
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,436
Case number one...
The People v, Clarence Madigan...

857
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,480
breaking and entering
in the nighttime.

858
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,482
Will the defendant rise
and come forward?

859
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,484
That's me, Your Honor.

860
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,054
State of Michigan,
court of Iron Cliffs...

861
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:31,031
I, Mitchell Lodwick, prosecuting
attorney, come into Iron Cliffs...

862
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,160
and give the court to understand
that one Clarence Madigan...

863
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,762
alias "One-Shot" Madigan,
alias "Smoky" Madigan...

864
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,172
did break and enter the dwelling house
of Casper Katz...

865
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,109
and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises.

866
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,981
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

867
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,917
No. A man's gotta have money to ask
them fellas the time of day.

868
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,920
Mr. Madigan,
if you're impoverished...

869
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:56,150
it's my duty to appoint an attorney
on your behalf.

870
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,318
I wouldn't bother, Your Honor.

871
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,727
I stole the whisky.
I'm guilty as hell.

872
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,197
It was a full case of
expensive bourbon, Your Honor.

873
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,995
Did you sell this whisky?

874
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,592
No. I drank it.

875
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,104
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

876
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,766
Are you aware that it will be
necessary to punish you for this crime?

877
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,843
It was worth it.

878
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,879
Well, I'll accept your plea
of guilty, Mr. Madigan.

879
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:20,609
You'll be sentenced later.
You may now return to your place.

880
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,617
Thanks, Your Honor.

881
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,822
Case number two...

882
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,323
The People v, Frederick Manion,

883
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,620
The charge... murder.

884
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:36,358
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

885
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,957
Which of these men
is your client, Mr. Biegler?

886
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,626
None of them.

887
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:44,036
Sheriff, will you produce
the prisoner?

888
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,042
Well, I... I'm afraid
I can't do that, Your Honor.

889
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,113
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

890
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:55,446
The defendant is in Detroit
being examined by a psychiatrist.

891
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,610
Shouldn't the court
have been consulted...

892
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,553
before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

893
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,683
Your Honor, we're dealing
with the army in this matter.

894
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,921
This is the only crack they would
give us at one of their psychiatrists.

895
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,729
The court was not present. It was urgent
we get the defendant to a psychiatrist.

896
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,132
What does the attorney for the people
say to this?

897
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,966
It was done with my knowledge.

898
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:21,009
I've always heard this Upper Pennisula
of our fair state was a queer place.

899
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,910
If it's customary here to allow a man
charged with first degree murder...

900
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:29,849
to wander about at will, I don't suppose
it behooves an outsider to point out...

901
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:33,979
that the law makes no provision
for such quaint liberalism.

902
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:38,789
The defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon.

903
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:42,490
We'll formally arraign the defendant
on his return.

904
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:46,090
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue to his plea?

905
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,399
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

906
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,939
A plea of"not guilty"
will be entered.

907
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:56,740
The case of Frederick Manion will be
placed first on the trial docket.

908
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,991
Can you hurry it up, Paulie?
If somebody tells that judge...

909
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:13,859
the prisoner was lounging around the
rail station, he'll give me the works.

910
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,864
This will just take a minute.
Come on over here.

911
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,332
Well, Lieutenant,
how'd things turn out?

912
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,907
- I was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?

913
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:29,068
Yeah. Says he's gonna
write you a letter.

914
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,113
I took some notes on my own.

915
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,206
The doctor's name is Smith.

916
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:38,276
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

917
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,719
A name like that
would impress the jury.

918
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:44,259
Just plain Matthew Smith.
He said that when I shot Quill...

919
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,227
I was suffering from
"dissociative reaction."

920
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,491
- Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
- What does it mean?

921
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:57,096
It means "I had an irresistible
impulse to shoot Quill."

922
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,699
That's okay, isn't it?

923
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:06,077
What did he say about your knowing
the difference between right and wrong?

924
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,777
I don't think he said anything.
Why, is that important?

925
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:13,117
We'd better not keep
the sheriff waiting. You'd better go.

926
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,895
Thank you, Sheriff.

927
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:36,609
Ever heard of a Michigan court accepting
"irresistible impulse" as insanity?

928
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:39,806
No. Maybe we'd better
switch to self-defense.

929
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,976
Even Mitch Lodwick would make
a monkey out of us then.

930
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:46,179
- Damn strawberry soda.
- Want a peanut?

931
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,052
No thanks.

932
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,455
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

933
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,724
We just have a weekend before the trial.
When do you want to start working?

934
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,061
Tomorrow morning, early.

935
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:55,022
- Paulie.
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

936
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,287
Never mind that.
Just find...

937
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:03,627
People v, Durfee, 62,
Michigan, 486, Year 1886.

938
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,134
That's it. I have it right here
in the A. L. R. Listen.

939
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,262
"The right and wrong test,
though deemed unscientific...

940
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,273
is adhered to by most states but..."

941
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,469
Now listen to this "but"...
"but the fact that one accused...

942
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,706
of committing a crime
may have been able to comprehend...

943
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,612
the nature and the consequences
of this act...

944
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,151
and to know that it was wrong.

945
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:28,019
- Nevertheless..."
- Sweet enduring word " Nevertheless."

946
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:31,355
" Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution...

947
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,591
by an impulse... by an impulse
which he was powerless to control...

948
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,293
he will be excused from punishment."

949
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:43,031
The Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse.

950
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,663
This is precedent.

951
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,265
Boy, I think we've got
a hold of something here.

952
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,844
Good old Durfee, 1886.

953
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,710
How about that?
Give me a pad.

954
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:56,478
This strawberry soda is beginning
to taste like real bourbon whisky.

955
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:00,282
Well, don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...

956
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,449
that our client was
irresistibly impulsed.

957
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,857
Remember that.

958
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,228
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
before we proceed further...

959
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:14,269
it will be necessary for me
to examine you on your qualifications...

960
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,429
to sit as jurors.

961
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,030
Will you please remember
that you are under oath?

962
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,541
Are all of you citizens?

963
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,306
Will you please
raise your hand if you are not?

964
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:42,196
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

965
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,289
No.

966
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,130
Are any of you related
by blood or marriage...

967
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,727
to any law enforcement officer?

968
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:55,300
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.

969
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,641
Do any of you have
any business pending...

970
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,341
with the prosecuting attorney,
Mitchell Lodwick?

971
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:05,553
Do any of you have any business pending
with Paul Biegler...

972
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,248
attorney for the defense?

973
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,882
Are any of you acquainted
with the defendant...

974
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,359
sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left?

975
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,531
Will Mrs. Laura Manion,
the defendant's wife, please stand?

976
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,902
Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?

977
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,838
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

978
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,308
Counsel may challenge the jury
for cause.

979
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:34,907
Before counsel's challenge, may I
introduce Claude Dancer to the court?

980
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,111
Mr. Dancer is an assistant
attorney general from Lansing.

981
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,018
Because of the peculiar nature
of this case...

982
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:44,854
I requested the attorney general to let
Mr. Dancer sit in with the prosecution.

983
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,827
Your reputation precedes you,
Mr. Dancer.

984
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,898
It's a privilege to have you
in my court.

985
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:53,025
Thank you.
I'm sure it'll be instructive.

986
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,626
Do any of you have
any business pending...

987
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,138
before the
attorney general's office?

988
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:03,476
I must apologize for
my disparaging remarks...

989
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,343
about the Upper Pennisula
and its customs.

990
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:11,751
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected
and sworn in less than half a day.

991
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,880
You have won my heart
completely, gentlemen.

992
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,289
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

993
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,227
It was a little suggestion
I wanted to make.

994
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,891
- By all means.
- Since the defense plea is insanity...

995
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,332
the prosecution has retained
a psychiatrist.

996
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,496
Under the statute, we have a right
to petition for a mental exam...

997
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,597
of the defendant
by our own doctor.

998
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:36,735
- Are you familiar with that statute?
- Uh-huh. Moderately.

999
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,679
I think it would only delay things
to file a formal petition...

1000
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:44,344
so why don't we informally agree
to ask His Honor for an adjournment...

1001
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:48,082
only a day or so, and our doctor
can visit with the defendant.

1002
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,454
It would save everyone time.
Don't you think so?

1003
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,459
- I'm sure it will.
- Good.

1004
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:56,827
Suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway.

1005
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:01,028
Of course, you're a little late.
Maybe His Honor will overlook that.

1006
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:05,597
Then I'd like the jury to see that you
think our insanity plea has some merit.

1007
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,836
There really won't be any need
for our doctor to examine your client.

1008
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,844
Naturally, I was only following
the usual procedure.

1009
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:12,379
Naturally, I'm all for it.

1010
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,609
- Do you wish to file the petition?
- Yes, Your Honor...

1011
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:18,619
- That won't be necessary.
- That's right.

1012
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:22,817
Skirmish over. Shall we join now
on the field of battle?

1013
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:30,626
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

1014
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,702
One of the bullets had passed
through the heart.

1015
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:37,238
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

1016
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,466
and was directly caused
by this wound.

1017
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,738
Dr. Raschid, may I have
your detailed report?

1018
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,005
Certainly.

1019
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:47,776
I ask that this report be marked
People's Exhibit One for identification.

1020
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,942
So received and marked.

1021
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:53,146
The people hand the defense
a copy of the report.

1022
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,450
Counsel may cross-examine.

1023
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:59,426
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose
was to ascertain the cause of death.

1024
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,621
- Was it not?
- Yes.

1025
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,893
And yet I read in your report here
that you checked to determine...

1026
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,528
whether spermatogenesis was occurring
in the body of the deceased.

1027
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,230
Objection.

1028
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,673
The people call this witness
only to show the cause of death.

1029
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:17,405
Your Honor, the entire report
was offered as evidence...

1030
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,482
and the report contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

1031
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,743
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.

1032
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,045
The witness may answer.

1033
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,281
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

1034
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:30,358
And now would you tell
the court your findings.

1035
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:33,394
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

1036
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:37,158
In other words, the deceased in life
was not sterile.

1037
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,325
- He could produce children.
- That is correct.

1038
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:42,370
Now, Doctor, if a woman says
that she has had intercourse...

1039
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:45,963
with a certain man
and the man is proved fertile...

1040
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,703
even though no evidence
is found in the woman's body...

1041
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,177
could a lawyer...
say a prosecuting attorney...

1042
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,772
could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

1043
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:59,286
Your Honor, I object
to this line of questioning.

1044
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:03,848
We're not concerned with if there has
been relations with a man and a woman.

1045
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:07,554
As long as an examination
for spermatogenesis has been made...

1046
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,654
at least we're entitled
to know why.

1047
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,198
Overruled. You may answer.

1048
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,098
Yes, prosecution could use that...

1049
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:17,604
though it certainly would not be
conclusive that she was lying.

1050
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,173
Why not?

1051
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,574
There could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative.

1052
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,704
The use of a contraceptive...

1053
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:29,580
or possibly there was no completion
on the part of the man.

1054
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:33,212
Now this postmortem,
were you also asked to determine...

1055
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,758
if the deceased had reached a
sexual climax shortly before his death?

1056
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,384
-No, sir.
-Could you have made this determination?

1057
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,019
Oh, yes.

1058
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,894
So, you were only asked to make
such an examination...

1059
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,866
that might be useful to the prosecution,
none that might help the defense?

1060
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,199
I object, Your Honor.

1061
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,034
The question is argumentative.

1062
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,543
Counsel is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the people.

1063
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,841
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1064
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,609
I withdraw the question
and apologize.

1065
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,049
The question and answer
will be stricken...

1066
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:08,317
and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1067
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:09,652
That's all.

1068
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,555
No redirect.

1069
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,823
The people now call
Lloyd Burke.

1070
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,330
Will the witness
step forward, please?

1071
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:25,267
How can a jury disregard
what it's already heard?

1072
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,274
- They can't, Lieutenant.
- Do you solemnly swear...

1073
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,367
the testimony you shall give
shall be the truth...

1074
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,742
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1075
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,715
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

1076
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:40,016
- Will you state your profession?
- I'm a commercial photographer.

1077
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:42,590
Were you called upon
by the police...

1078
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:46,388
to take photographs of the body
of the deceased Bernard Quill...

1079
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:49,430
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1080
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,793
Yes, sir.

1081
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,959
Were these photographs
of the deceased made by you?

1082
01:12:58,407 --> 01:12:59,965
They were.

1083
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:04,910
The recorder will please mark
these People's Exhibit 282-D.

1084
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,574
Photos are tendered to the defense
for examination.

1085
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,551
And the people move their admission
as evidence. Your witness.

1086
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,746
No questions. No objections.

1087
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,188
Paul, he took pictures
of me that night too.

1088
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,759
Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1089
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:26,631
These photos offered as evidence, are
they the only ones you took that night?

1090
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,828
Why, no.

1091
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,905
I suppose the others
didn't turn out?

1092
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,736
All my pictures turn out.

1093
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:36,538
Of course.
I beg your pardon.

1094
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,478
Did you give the other pictures
to the police?

1095
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,048
I did.

1096
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,879
What were they?

1097
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,284
Were they side shots
or a shot of the moon perhaps...

1098
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,118
or a black bear scavenging
the Thunder Bay dump?

1099
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:53,058
I object. I can't see how
other photographs are relevant.

1100
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:58,065
The photos were introduced to show
the deceased met with a violent death.

1101
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,625
I should think any photo pertaining
to the case would be relevant.

1102
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,638
The point is good, Mr. Biegler.
Continue.

1103
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,470
What were these
other photographs of?

1104
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:09,969
Lieutenant Manion's wife.

1105
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:14,242
You mean they showed how she looked
after Barney Quill was killed?

1106
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:17,250
- Yes.
- How she looked is irrelevant.

1107
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,844
There's no evidence to connect
Mrs. Manion's appearance to this murder.

1108
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,117
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry.

1109
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,592
I just wanted to make sure prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1110
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,356
Now look here!

1111
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,831
I protest to the defense attorney's
persistent attacks...

1112
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,925
on the motives
of the prosecution.

1113
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:38,803
The jury will disregard the mark
made by the defense attorney.

1114
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:41,740
There's no reason to believe
that the prosecution...

1115
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,402
has not acted in good faith.

1116
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,987
My apologies to the prosecution
and to the court.

1117
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:49,544
But Your Honor,
as long as protests are being made...

1118
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:52,207
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1119
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:57,583
I'm perfectly willing to take on these
two legal giants anytime, anyplace...

1120
01:14:57,688 --> 01:15:00,521
but in all fairness
it ought to be one at a time.

1121
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:04,061
I don't want these two fellas pitching
knuckleballs at me at the same time.

1122
01:15:04,162 --> 01:15:07,563
It seems to me you're batting
close to a thousand...

1123
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:10,065
but your point is well taken.

1124
01:15:10,168 --> 01:15:12,762
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

1125
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:17,500
he alone shall continue with that
witness until the witness is excused.

1126
01:15:17,608 --> 01:15:20,133
Thank you, Your Honor.
No more questions.

1127
01:15:20,244 --> 01:15:22,041
No questions.

1128
01:15:32,557 --> 01:15:35,287
- My, we're drawing well, aren't we?
- Where's Parnell?

1129
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:37,418
Parnell? Isn't he here?

1130
01:15:37,528 --> 01:15:40,588
No, he's not here, not in his rooming
house and hasn't been there all night.

1131
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:42,723
You were the last to see him.
Where is he?

1132
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:46,826
- I promised not to tell, so don't ask.
- He hasn't fallen off the wagon?

1133
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:49,532
- No, he was sober.
- Has he gone somewhere?

1134
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,336
He did borrow my car
for something or other.

1135
01:15:52,443 --> 01:15:55,571
Your car? That was smart.
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.

1136
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,773
He'll kill himself.
Now where's he gone?

1137
01:15:57,882 --> 01:16:00,214
My word is my bond.

1138
01:16:25,476 --> 01:16:28,877
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
You may proceed.

1139
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,380
Your Honor...

1140
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:35,111
the defense notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1141
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:38,620
We're wondering if the court shares
our curiosity as to just who he is?

1142
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:40,623
I was about to introduce him.

1143
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:44,661
Your Honor, this gentlemen
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1144
01:16:44,762 --> 01:16:48,789
Dr. Harcourt is the people's
psychiatrist in this case.

1145
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:53,336
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

1146
01:16:53,437 --> 01:16:55,166
What are you going to
have him observe...

1147
01:16:55,273 --> 01:16:58,709
the constellation ofTaurus
or the life and times of a bumblebee?

1148
01:16:58,809 --> 01:17:01,573
To observe the defendant, of course.

1149
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,944
That's fine.
The defense has no objection.

1150
01:17:05,049 --> 01:17:07,142
I just wish to express my relief...

1151
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:11,950
that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1152
01:17:12,056 --> 01:17:14,388
Call Alphonse Paquette.

1153
01:17:20,831 --> 01:17:22,662
Raise your right hand.

1154
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:25,600
Do you solemnly swear the testimony
you give in this case...

1155
01:17:25,703 --> 01:17:29,230
shall be the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1156
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,240
- I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1157
01:17:33,778 --> 01:17:37,305
- Will you state your name?
- Alphonse Paquette.

1158
01:17:37,415 --> 01:17:41,613
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn?
- I'm bartender there.

1159
01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:45,086
Were you working the night that Barney
Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1160
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:47,589
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1161
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:48,920
I was.

1162
01:17:49,026 --> 01:17:52,757
Will you tell us in your own words
what happened?

1163
01:17:52,863 --> 01:17:56,390
I was at a table by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1164
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,298
Did you know Lt. Manion
by sight and name?

1165
01:17:59,403 --> 01:18:01,303
Go ahead.

1166
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:05,865
Well, he came in and walked
over to the bar and began to shoot.

1167
01:18:05,976 --> 01:18:08,570
He shot Barney when he came
up to the bar...

1168
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:12,547
and when Barney fell he kept on shooting
at Barney behind the bar.

1169
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,550
Then he turned around and walked out.

1170
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:18,884
When Lt. Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1171
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:23,551
Well, he walked slow, kind of deliberate
I guess you could say.

1172
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:25,754
Did he speak to Barney Quill?

1173
01:18:25,863 --> 01:18:29,128
Not a word. Just walked over
and pulled out his gun...

1174
01:18:29,233 --> 01:18:30,700
and bang.

1175
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:33,929
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.

1176
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:37,201
When he walked out,
how did he appear to you?

1177
01:18:37,308 --> 01:18:39,799
He seemed just like he did
when he walked in...

1178
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,140
like he was the mailman
delivering the mail.

1179
01:18:42,246 --> 01:18:45,613
When Lt. Manion walked
out of the bar, what did you do?

1180
01:18:45,716 --> 01:18:48,981
Well, it happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned.

1181
01:18:49,086 --> 01:18:51,953
- But then I ran out after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1182
01:18:52,056 --> 01:18:54,957
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1183
01:18:55,059 --> 01:18:59,018
Yes, sir. I said, " Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1184
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:01,564
Did he reply to you?

1185
01:19:01,665 --> 01:19:05,157
He said,
" Do you want some too, buster?"

1186
01:19:05,269 --> 01:19:07,260
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1187
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:11,171
He was holding the gun in my direction,
but the muzzle was low.

1188
01:19:11,275 --> 01:19:15,405
When he said,
" Do you want some too, buster?"...

1189
01:19:15,513 --> 01:19:17,413
how was that expressed?

1190
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:20,416
Did he shout it?
Was it hysterical?

1191
01:19:20,518 --> 01:19:23,214
Was he hoarse?
Did his voice tremble?

1192
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,518
No, sir. He just said it
cool and hard and looked right at me.

1193
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:30,651
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1194
01:19:30,761 --> 01:19:33,924
to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

1195
01:19:34,031 --> 01:19:37,467
- Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.
- Your witness.

1196
01:19:37,568 --> 01:19:42,198
Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion
in the bar that night?

1197
01:19:42,306 --> 01:19:45,537
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1198
01:19:45,643 --> 01:19:49,511
I don't see why the prosecution's
so jumpy. I haven't gone anyplace yet.

1199
01:19:49,613 --> 01:19:53,481
Let's see where he's going
before we start objecting.

1200
01:19:53,584 --> 01:19:55,643
You may proceed.

1201
01:19:55,753 --> 01:19:58,415
Did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1202
01:19:58,522 --> 01:20:02,390
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave that night?

1203
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:04,859
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1204
01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:06,896
I think he came back around midnight.

1205
01:20:06,997 --> 01:20:10,558
Now from which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance...

1206
01:20:10,668 --> 01:20:13,262
or come from that outside entrance?

1207
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:15,565
It was from the lobby.

1208
01:20:15,673 --> 01:20:18,471
- And how did he appear to you then?
- How do you mean?

1209
01:20:18,576 --> 01:20:21,841
You understood the prosecution well
when he asked you that question...

1210
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:23,846
about Lt. Manion's appearance.

1211
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:27,179
Oh, well, he was just
old Barney, like usual.

1212
01:20:27,284 --> 01:20:32,779
You mean he was just good old sober,
reliable, gentle...

1213
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,484
salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney.

1214
01:20:35,593 --> 01:20:37,720
Your Honor, what kind
of a question is that?

1215
01:20:37,828 --> 01:20:40,194
I withdraw the question, Your Honor.

1216
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:47,028
Had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1217
01:20:47,137 --> 01:20:48,365
I don't remember.

1218
01:20:48,472 --> 01:20:51,464
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned...

1219
01:20:51,575 --> 01:20:54,169
that is, might he
have changed his clothes?

1220
01:20:54,278 --> 01:20:56,178
I didn't notice.

1221
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,441
Was Barney drinking that night?

1222
01:20:58,549 --> 01:21:02,781
Well, he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers.

1223
01:21:02,887 --> 01:21:06,345
- He's friendly.
- Oh, sure, he was. Good old Barney.

1224
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:10,223
Now how many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1225
01:21:10,327 --> 01:21:11,885
I don't know.

1226
01:21:11,996 --> 01:21:14,692
Wasn't he in fact pretty loaded
that night?

1227
01:21:14,798 --> 01:21:17,858
Objection. Even if the deceased
was dead drunk...

1228
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:19,868
it's no defense to this charge.

1229
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:23,235
Sustained.
I suggest you get off this.

1230
01:21:25,009 --> 01:21:28,911
What would you call a man with
an insatiable penchant for women?

1231
01:21:29,013 --> 01:21:30,708
A what?

1232
01:21:30,814 --> 01:21:34,477
A penchant, a desire,
taste, passion.

1233
01:21:34,585 --> 01:21:37,679
Well, a ladies man, I guess.

1234
01:21:37,788 --> 01:21:40,018
Or maybe just a damn fool.

1235
01:21:41,425 --> 01:21:44,451
Just answer the questions.

1236
01:21:44,562 --> 01:21:47,224
The attorneys will provide
the wisecracks.

1237
01:21:47,331 --> 01:21:51,267
Well, what else would you call
a man like that?

1238
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:55,634
- We can't see the drift of this.
- You mean you do see.

1239
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:56,899
You may answer.

1240
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:59,407
Can you think of another name?

1241
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:01,205
Woman chaser.

1242
01:22:01,312 --> 01:22:03,906
- Try again.
- Masher?

1243
01:22:04,014 --> 01:22:05,948
Oh, come now.

1244
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,486
Mashers went out with whalebone corsets
and hairnets.

1245
01:22:09,587 --> 01:22:11,487
Did you ever hear
the expression "wolf"?

1246
01:22:11,589 --> 01:22:14,285
Sure, I heard that.
It just slipped my mind.

1247
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:16,484
Well, naturally, it would...

1248
01:22:16,594 --> 01:22:19,620
clanking around in there
with all those rusty old "mashers."

1249
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:22,961
Have you ever known a man
you could call a wolf?

1250
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:26,036
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?

1251
01:22:26,136 --> 01:22:27,694
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't?

1252
01:22:27,805 --> 01:22:29,705
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1253
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:33,243
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't tell you.

1254
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:38,304
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had gone...

1255
01:22:38,415 --> 01:22:40,781
- did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:40,884 --> 01:22:44,047
- And what did he say then?
- He said, "I'll take over."

1257
01:22:44,154 --> 01:22:47,590
When you came out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1258
01:22:47,691 --> 01:22:50,455
I went over to the table
where the Pedersons were sitting.

1259
01:22:50,561 --> 01:22:54,520
Now you testified that you were
by the door when Lt. Manion came in.

1260
01:22:54,632 --> 01:22:57,601
Is that the reason you were by the door,
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1261
01:22:57,701 --> 01:22:59,134
Yes.

1262
01:22:59,236 --> 01:23:02,831
And how long was it
before Lt. Manion came in?

1263
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:06,034
I don't know exactly.
Maybe 30 minutes.

1264
01:23:06,143 --> 01:23:08,805
And you remained at
the Pedersons' table all that time?

1265
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:13,281
- Yes, they're friends of mine.
- Is there a window beside that table?

1266
01:23:13,384 --> 01:23:15,352
- I think so.
- You think so.

1267
01:23:15,452 --> 01:23:18,615
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn?

1268
01:23:18,722 --> 01:23:20,485
About six, seven years.

1269
01:23:20,591 --> 01:23:22,752
Does this window beside the table...

1270
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:28,423
suddenly vanish and reappear and
come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1271
01:23:28,532 --> 01:23:30,295
It's there all the time.

1272
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:34,462
While you were talking to your friends
there, did you look out of the window?

1273
01:23:34,571 --> 01:23:38,302
-I might have.
-Were you looking for something special?

1274
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:40,434
No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1275
01:23:40,544 --> 01:23:44,503
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go to
that window and look out for Lt. Manion?

1276
01:23:48,385 --> 01:23:51,411
Did he tell you to look out
for Lt. Manion?

1277
01:23:51,522 --> 01:23:54,582
He did not.

1278
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:58,526
Barney was quite a marksmen,
wasn't he, with guns?

1279
01:23:58,629 --> 01:24:00,859
He won a lot of prizes.

1280
01:24:02,266 --> 01:24:05,064
Did he keep any guns
behind the bar?

1281
01:24:10,941 --> 01:24:12,408
He might have.

1282
01:24:12,509 --> 01:24:16,411
Isn't it a fact there are three
concealed pistol racks behind the bar?

1283
01:24:16,513 --> 01:24:20,347
The defendant's plea is one of insanity,
not self-defense.

1284
01:24:20,451 --> 01:24:24,285
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten
that fact, Mr. Lodwick.

1285
01:24:24,388 --> 01:24:25,855
You may answer.

1286
01:24:25,956 --> 01:24:28,254
Are there concealed gun racks
behind the bar?

1287
01:24:28,358 --> 01:24:29,586
Yes.

1288
01:24:29,693 --> 01:24:32,856
And how many people know
about these gun racks?

1289
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:35,227
- I couldn't say.
- Isn't it a fact...

1290
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:39,496
that Barney would take the guns out
of the racks and twirl them...

1291
01:24:39,603 --> 01:24:43,300
to demonstrate his skill
to the patrons?

1292
01:24:43,407 --> 01:24:45,341
- I don't remember.
- Come on.

1293
01:24:45,442 --> 01:24:48,707
Try and remember.
Did you ever see him do that yourself?

1294
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:52,179
- Once or twice he did.
- That's all.

1295
01:24:52,282 --> 01:24:55,342
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1296
01:24:55,452 --> 01:24:57,682
Call George Lemon.

1297
01:25:03,327 --> 01:25:06,057
Biegler's going off
in all directions.

1298
01:25:06,163 --> 01:25:08,393
What's he getting at?

1299
01:25:11,001 --> 01:25:14,801
I have a feeling he's afraid
of what we'll get at.

1300
01:25:14,905 --> 01:25:17,772
Mr. Biegler's putting up
a smoke screen for some reason.

1301
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:20,605
- I do.
- Take a seat please.

1302
01:25:22,112 --> 01:25:25,548
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1303
01:25:25,649 --> 01:25:27,549
What kind of work do you do?

1304
01:25:27,651 --> 01:25:30,779
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1305
01:25:30,888 --> 01:25:32,913
I see the place is clean
and orderly.

1306
01:25:33,023 --> 01:25:35,457
I check people in and out
and lock the gate at night.

1307
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:38,824
And what is your authority
for these duties?

1308
01:25:38,929 --> 01:25:42,695
I'm paid by Madison Township
and I'm also a deputy sheriff.

1309
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,233
Just courtesy, sort of.

1310
01:25:44,334 --> 01:25:47,735
Did you see Lt. Manion
on the night of the 15th?

1311
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:50,705
- The night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1312
01:25:51,742 --> 01:25:56,202
Will you tell the court
about how and when...

1313
01:25:56,313 --> 01:25:58,747
you saw Lt. Manion.

1314
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:01,943
About 1:00 a. m. a knock on my door
waked me up.

1315
01:26:02,052 --> 01:26:04,612
I went to the door and Lt. Manion
was standing there.

1316
01:26:04,721 --> 01:26:09,522
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1317
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:12,823
I told him to go back to his trailer
and that I would call the state police.

1318
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:16,798
How did Lt. Manion appear to you
when he asked you to take him?

1319
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,495
He said what he had to say
and did what I told him. No fuss.

1320
01:26:20,604 --> 01:26:24,096
Did he appear to you to be...
as far as you could tell...

1321
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:26,438
in complete possession
of his faculties?

1322
01:26:26,543 --> 01:26:28,670
As far as I could tell,
yes, sir.

1323
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,348
Take the witness.

1324
01:26:32,449 --> 01:26:35,816
Mr. Lemon, did you go
to the Manions' trailer?

1325
01:26:35,919 --> 01:26:38,888
-Yes, sir.
-Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?

1326
01:26:38,989 --> 01:26:42,481
- Yes, sir.
- What was her appearance?

1327
01:26:42,593 --> 01:26:44,823
She was a mess.

1328
01:26:44,928 --> 01:26:46,156
Objection.

1329
01:26:46,263 --> 01:26:50,461
No evidence has been introduced to make
Mrs. Manion's appearance relevant.

1330
01:26:50,567 --> 01:26:54,128
No evidence has been introduced to make
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1331
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:56,468
but you didn't object
to the question then.

1332
01:26:56,573 --> 01:27:00,009
Is that because you know Barney Quill
bathed and changed...

1333
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:02,908
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman?

1334
01:27:03,013 --> 01:27:06,380
Your Honor, everybody in this court
is being tried except Mr. Manion.

1335
01:27:06,483 --> 01:27:11,216
Now listen, this is a cross-examination
murder case, not a high school debate!

1336
01:27:11,321 --> 01:27:15,485
What are you trying to do,
railroad this soldier into the clink?

1337
01:27:15,592 --> 01:27:17,822
Mr. Biegler, you are
an experienced attorney...

1338
01:27:17,928 --> 01:27:20,658
and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1339
01:27:20,764 --> 01:27:23,858
I will not tolerate intemperance
of this sort.

1340
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:26,902
If you once again try the patience
of this court...

1341
01:27:27,004 --> 01:27:30,440
I shall hold you in contempt.

1342
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,599
Sorry.

1343
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:34,802
Your Honor...

1344
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:38,348
I apologize and
it won't happen again.

1345
01:27:38,448 --> 01:27:40,473
The witness's answer
will be stricken...

1346
01:27:40,584 --> 01:27:43,451
and the jury will disregard
the answer.

1347
01:27:43,553 --> 01:27:46,317
Now you may proceed,
Mr. Biegler.

1348
01:27:46,423 --> 01:27:48,391
Yes, sir.

1349
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,989
On the night when Lt. Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1350
01:27:54,097 --> 01:27:57,760
had you been awakened before... had
anything else disturbed your slumbers?

1351
01:27:57,868 --> 01:28:00,632
- No, sir.
- There were no soldiers singing?

1352
01:28:00,737 --> 01:28:03,297
No, sir. Not in my park
after 10:00.

1353
01:28:03,407 --> 01:28:07,434
- There were no women screaming?
- Those screams were down by the gate.

1354
01:28:07,544 --> 01:28:09,273
Objection!

1355
01:28:09,379 --> 01:28:12,280
I see no reason for objecting yet.

1356
01:28:12,382 --> 01:28:15,476
Tell us about those screams.

1357
01:28:15,585 --> 01:28:19,077
I didn't hear them myself. There were
tourists from Ohio in the park...

1358
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:21,657
and they heard them
and told me about it the next day.

1359
01:28:21,758 --> 01:28:24,659
- Now, Mr. Lodwick.
- This testimony is incompetent...

1360
01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:28,822
hearsay, irrelevant,
immaterial, inconclusive...

1361
01:28:28,932 --> 01:28:32,766
Well, that's too much for me.
The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick.

1362
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:34,996
Huh?

1363
01:28:35,105 --> 01:28:37,164
No questions.

1364
01:28:37,274 --> 01:28:39,333
The witness may step down.

1365
01:28:39,443 --> 01:28:41,843
Call your next witness.

1366
01:28:43,246 --> 01:28:45,373
Detective SergeantJames Durgo.

1367
01:28:47,351 --> 01:28:49,911
- Hi, Paulie.
- Hi, Jim. Come here.

1368
01:28:51,621 --> 01:28:54,556
As soon as we break, you'd better phone
that army psychiatrist.

1369
01:28:54,658 --> 01:28:57,354
-Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
-Will do.

1370
01:28:57,461 --> 01:29:00,828
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1371
01:29:00,931 --> 01:29:02,865
Won't do.

1372
01:29:02,966 --> 01:29:05,264
Well, you're fired.

1373
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:08,031
You can't fire me
till you pay me.

1374
01:29:08,138 --> 01:29:10,368
Detective SergeantJames Durgo
of the state police.

1375
01:29:10,474 --> 01:29:13,705
Were you called to Thunder Bay by
Deputy Sheriff Lemon ofThunder Bay...

1376
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:15,744
on the night Barney Quill
was killed?

1377
01:29:16,747 --> 01:29:19,614
Yes, sir. My companion officer and I
were the first to be called in.

1378
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:23,380
When you arrived at the Manion trailer,
who was there?

1379
01:29:23,487 --> 01:29:25,717
Lt. Manion and his wife were there.

1380
01:29:25,822 --> 01:29:29,053
What did Lt. Manion say to you?

1381
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:32,424
He said that his wife had had
some trouble with Barney Quill.

1382
01:29:32,529 --> 01:29:35,293
He had gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1383
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:38,698
He asked us whether Quill was dead
or not. We told him he was.

1384
01:29:38,802 --> 01:29:41,737
How did Lt. Manion
take this information?

1385
01:29:41,838 --> 01:29:43,601
He didn't seem surprised.

1386
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:45,607
What did you do then?

1387
01:29:45,709 --> 01:29:47,609
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1388
01:29:47,711 --> 01:29:51,807
Did you take Lt. Manion to the county
jail here in Iron City that same night?

1389
01:29:51,915 --> 01:29:54,611
Yes, sir. We drove the Lieutenant
down with his wife.

1390
01:29:54,718 --> 01:29:59,815
On the drive to Iron City, did Manion
talk further about the shooting?

1391
01:29:59,923 --> 01:30:03,484
He remarked that if he had the whole
thing to do over, he'd still do it.

1392
01:30:03,593 --> 01:30:07,256
During all this, at the trailer,
the drive to Iron City...

1393
01:30:07,364 --> 01:30:09,264
how did Lt. Manion appear to you?

1394
01:30:10,567 --> 01:30:14,059
He was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clearheaded.

1395
01:30:14,171 --> 01:30:18,369
Would you say he was in complete
possession of his faculties?

1396
01:30:18,475 --> 01:30:21,069
- Seemed so to me.
- Your witness.

1397
01:30:21,178 --> 01:30:24,978
Sergeant Durgo, you testified
that Lt. Manion told you...

1398
01:30:25,082 --> 01:30:30,384
he shot Barney Quill after he learned
his wife had some trouble with Quill.

1399
01:30:30,487 --> 01:30:33,923
Were these the words Lt. Manion
used, "some trouble"?

1400
01:30:34,024 --> 01:30:36,356
No, sir. Those were my words,
not his.

1401
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:39,452
And was it your notion to come here
and use your own words?

1402
01:30:39,563 --> 01:30:41,224
No, sir.

1403
01:30:41,331 --> 01:30:43,629
And was the suggestion to call it
"some trouble"...

1404
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:46,668
made by somebody here
in the courtroom?

1405
01:30:48,472 --> 01:30:49,598
Yes, sir.

1406
01:30:50,974 --> 01:30:55,707
Sergeant, would you tell the court
what words Lt. Manion actually used...

1407
01:30:55,812 --> 01:30:58,110
to describe the trouble
his wife had had.

1408
01:30:58,215 --> 01:31:00,809
Objection.
We've been over this before.

1409
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:04,045
This information would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1410
01:31:04,154 --> 01:31:06,748
This statement concerning some trouble
was brought out...

1411
01:31:06,857 --> 01:31:09,724
during the direct examination
of Sergeant Durgo.

1412
01:31:09,826 --> 01:31:13,023
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted
all testimony...

1413
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:15,223
as far as Laura Manion's concerned.

1414
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:18,631
All right, the cat's out of the bag.
It's fair game for me to chase it.

1415
01:31:18,735 --> 01:31:22,193
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1416
01:31:22,305 --> 01:31:24,500
I'd like to hear
from the prosecution.

1417
01:31:24,608 --> 01:31:29,102
Burden is on defense to prove temporary
insanity at the time of the shooting.

1418
01:31:29,212 --> 01:31:33,148
Now, if the reason for the alleged
insanity is important to this case...

1419
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,775
then that is a matter
for a competent witness...

1420
01:31:35,886 --> 01:31:39,515
an expert on the subject
of the human mind.

1421
01:31:39,623 --> 01:31:42,285
What the defense is trying to do...

1422
01:31:42,392 --> 01:31:45,088
is introduce
some sensational material...

1423
01:31:45,195 --> 01:31:49,029
for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues.

1424
01:31:49,132 --> 01:31:53,933
How can the jury accurately estimate
the testimony being given here...

1425
01:31:54,037 --> 01:31:57,495
unless they first know the reason
behind this whole trial...

1426
01:31:57,607 --> 01:32:00,474
why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?

1427
01:32:00,577 --> 01:32:04,536
The prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act.

1428
01:32:04,648 --> 01:32:09,642
That's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1429
01:32:09,753 --> 01:32:14,690
Now the core of our defense is that
the defendant's temporary insanity...

1430
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:18,158
was triggered by the so-called trouble
with Quill.

1431
01:32:18,261 --> 01:32:20,388
And I beg the court...

1432
01:32:20,497 --> 01:32:24,797
I... I beg the court
to let me cut into the apple.

1433
01:32:26,736 --> 01:32:29,068
Our objection still stands,
Your Honor.

1434
01:32:43,853 --> 01:32:45,480
Objection overruled.

1435
01:32:52,362 --> 01:32:55,661
Sergeant Durgo,
tell the court...

1436
01:32:55,765 --> 01:32:59,758
how Lt. Manion described
the trouble his wife had with Quill.

1437
01:32:59,869 --> 01:33:03,305
He told us that Quill
had raped his wife.

1438
01:33:03,406 --> 01:33:08,400
Now, can you recall generally what
Lt. Manion told you about this rape?

1439
01:33:08,511 --> 01:33:12,641
Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleep
right after dinner.

1440
01:33:12,749 --> 01:33:16,810
He was waked up by some noise...
screams he thought.

1441
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,913
He got up, opened the trailer door
and went outside.

1442
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,050
His wife came running out of the dark
and fell into his arms.

1443
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,425
As you saw his wife in the trailer,
how did she look?

1444
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:30,624
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1445
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:33,635
She had big black bruises
all over her face and arms.

1446
01:33:33,737 --> 01:33:36,900
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

1447
01:33:37,007 --> 01:33:39,874
- She did.
- Did she take you to where it happened?

1448
01:33:39,976 --> 01:33:41,443
Yes, the next morning.

1449
01:33:41,544 --> 01:33:46,811
Did you find anything there pertaining
to the story Mrs. Manion told you?

1450
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:51,910
On the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks...

1451
01:33:52,022 --> 01:33:56,584
and a leather case with
some horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1452
01:33:56,693 --> 01:33:59,321
We also looked for...

1453
01:33:59,429 --> 01:34:02,489
a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's,
but we didn't find it.

1454
01:34:02,599 --> 01:34:05,397
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench?

1455
01:34:09,639 --> 01:34:13,473
Mr. Biegler, you've finally got
your rape into the case.

1456
01:34:13,576 --> 01:34:17,535
I think all the details should now
be made clear to the jury.

1457
01:34:17,647 --> 01:34:21,378
- Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
- Absolutely.

1458
01:34:21,484 --> 01:34:24,976
What exactly was the undergarment
just referred to?

1459
01:34:25,088 --> 01:34:26,817
Panties, Your Honor.

1460
01:34:26,923 --> 01:34:30,359
- Do you expect this to come up again?
- Yes, sir.

1461
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:34,760
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1462
01:34:34,864 --> 01:34:37,025
Can we find another name for them?

1463
01:34:37,133 --> 01:34:39,863
I never heard my wife
call them anything else.

1464
01:34:39,969 --> 01:34:43,132
- Mr. Biegler.
- I'm a bachelor, Your Honor.

1465
01:34:43,239 --> 01:34:45,969
That's a great help.
Mr. Dancer?

1466
01:34:46,076 --> 01:34:50,945
I was overseas during the war.
I learned a French word.

1467
01:34:51,047 --> 01:34:53,311
I'm afraid that might be
slightly suggestive.

1468
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,407
Most French words are.

1469
01:34:55,518 --> 01:34:58,851
All right, gentlemen,
back to your places.

1470
01:34:58,955 --> 01:35:03,858
For the benefit of the jury, but more
especially for the spectators...

1471
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,862
the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1472
01:35:07,964 --> 01:35:09,693
Mrs. Manion's panties.

1473
01:35:13,903 --> 01:35:17,669
I wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with.

1474
01:35:17,774 --> 01:35:22,040
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial.

1475
01:35:22,145 --> 01:35:25,740
And when it happens, there will not be
one laugh, one snicker...

1476
01:35:25,849 --> 01:35:29,717
one giggle or even one smirk
in my courtroom.

1477
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:33,414
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1478
01:35:33,523 --> 01:35:37,015
which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1479
01:35:37,127 --> 01:35:41,325
and the possible incarceration
of another.

1480
01:35:41,431 --> 01:35:43,160
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1481
01:35:43,266 --> 01:35:45,393
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie detector test?

1482
01:35:45,502 --> 01:35:48,960
Objection. A polygraph test is
inadmissible evidence in our courts.

1483
01:35:49,072 --> 01:35:52,439
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1484
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:54,442
He may answer that.

1485
01:35:54,544 --> 01:35:57,570
I gave her a lie detector test
at her request.

1486
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,172
Now after all this investigation,
did you believe Mrs. Manion?

1487
01:36:01,284 --> 01:36:03,775
- I did.
- Even after the lie detector test?

1488
01:36:03,887 --> 01:36:09,348
That question constitutes flagrant
subterfuge on part of the defense.

1489
01:36:09,459 --> 01:36:11,051
Objection sustained.

1490
01:36:12,162 --> 01:36:15,689
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
a polygraph or lie detector test...

1491
01:36:15,799 --> 01:36:17,699
is not admissible in evidence...

1492
01:36:17,801 --> 01:36:19,928
because no one
has ever been quite sure...

1493
01:36:20,036 --> 01:36:23,802
that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1494
01:36:23,907 --> 01:36:25,534
Go ahead.

1495
01:36:25,642 --> 01:36:29,635
In any case, you yourself
in your own heart and mind...

1496
01:36:29,746 --> 01:36:32,374
are quite convinced
of Mrs. Manion's honesty?

1497
01:36:32,482 --> 01:36:35,042
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1498
01:36:36,619 --> 01:36:38,177
Just a moment.

1499
01:36:41,658 --> 01:36:46,561
Did you look for the panties elsewhere
other than the lane in the woods?

1500
01:36:46,663 --> 01:36:49,894
We looked in Barney Quill's car,
his room in the hotel.

1501
01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:51,466
We didn't find them.

1502
01:36:51,568 --> 01:36:55,129
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie detector test?

1503
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:57,138
- I know what she said.
- What?

1504
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:01,006
She wanted everyone to believe her story
because she knew it'd help her husband.

1505
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:02,873
Was that the only reason she gave?

1506
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:07,279
Said she swore to her husband. Said she
wanted everyone else to believe it too.

1507
01:37:07,383 --> 01:37:09,283
One moment, please.

1508
01:37:13,022 --> 01:37:15,616
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1509
01:37:15,725 --> 01:37:19,024
Did Mrs. Manion say how
she had sworn to her husband?

1510
01:37:19,128 --> 01:37:23,064
Yes, sir. She said
she had sworn on a rosary.

1511
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:28,001
This lane in the woods,
what's it used for, where does it go?

1512
01:37:28,104 --> 01:37:31,301
It used to be a logging road.
It doesn't go anyplace, just stops.

1513
01:37:31,407 --> 01:37:33,307
Who uses it now?

1514
01:37:33,409 --> 01:37:35,639
I think it's a road
kids drive down to park.

1515
01:37:35,745 --> 01:37:38,373
- You mean it's a lovers' lane?
- I think so.

1516
01:37:38,481 --> 01:37:41,348
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.

1517
01:37:41,451 --> 01:37:44,887
- The witness may step down.
- In view of evidence concerning rape...

1518
01:37:44,988 --> 01:37:47,149
which Your Honor
has ruled admissible...

1519
01:37:47,257 --> 01:37:49,487
the prosecution asks for
a 30-minute recess...

1520
01:37:49,592 --> 01:37:52,584
in order to bring in another witness
we had not anticipated using?

1521
01:37:52,695 --> 01:37:55,391
All right.
We'll take a 30-minute recess.

1522
01:37:55,498 --> 01:37:56,988
Recess.

1523
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:06,374
Why didn't you tell me
about that rosary?

1524
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,610
I forgot it.

1525
01:38:09,712 --> 01:38:14,274
We didn't forget it. Manny said maybe
we shouldn't tell that again.

1526
01:38:14,384 --> 01:38:18,286
It might have looked like something
else... like I didn't believe her.

1527
01:38:19,756 --> 01:38:24,625
- How much more didn't you tell me?
- We told you everything else.

1528
01:38:24,727 --> 01:38:26,752
Is that right, Laura?

1529
01:38:26,863 --> 01:38:29,024
Oh, yes, everything else.

1530
01:38:29,132 --> 01:38:31,293
Now get this, both of you.

1531
01:38:31,401 --> 01:38:35,337
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

1532
01:38:35,438 --> 01:38:37,929
I don't want you to tell anything
but the truth.

1533
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:42,910
Don't try and lie or conceal anything
or you get skinned alive.

1534
01:38:43,012 --> 01:38:45,242
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1535
01:39:06,202 --> 01:39:09,763
Dr. Dompierre, did you have occasion
to come to the county jail...

1536
01:39:09,872 --> 01:39:12,238
on the night of August 15 this year?

1537
01:39:12,342 --> 01:39:14,970
- I did.
- Who called you to the jail?

1538
01:39:15,078 --> 01:39:18,479
- The police authorities.
- What did they want you to do?

1539
01:39:18,581 --> 01:39:21,550
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1540
01:39:21,651 --> 01:39:24,017
on the person
of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1541
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:27,920
- I made the test.
- What was your conclusion?

1542
01:39:28,024 --> 01:39:31,152
- Negative. There was none.
- Your witness.

1543
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:37,464
In making these tests, did you notice
any bruises or marks on Mrs. Manion?

1544
01:39:37,567 --> 01:39:38,829
I did.

1545
01:39:38,935 --> 01:39:41,426
Were you asked to determine
the reason for these bruises?

1546
01:39:41,537 --> 01:39:45,473
- I was not.
- Where did you do the lab work?

1547
01:39:45,575 --> 01:39:47,873
St. Margaret's Hospital
in the city.

1548
01:39:47,977 --> 01:39:52,038
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- Technician at the hospital.

1549
01:39:52,148 --> 01:39:54,207
Wouldn't it have been better...

1550
01:39:54,317 --> 01:39:58,310
to have these slides worked up by
a pathologist or expert in this field?

1551
01:39:58,421 --> 01:40:01,413
Yes, but the police
were in a hurry.

1552
01:40:01,524 --> 01:40:04,049
I happened to know this young fella
came on at 7:00 in the morning.

1553
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,152
Wouldn't it have been especially better
to wait for the expert...

1554
01:40:07,263 --> 01:40:09,857
if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1555
01:40:09,966 --> 01:40:14,164
- It would have been.
- In the newspaper of August 16...

1556
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:17,330
it was stated that you found
no evidence of rape, is that true?

1557
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,806
It is not true.
I made no such statement.

1558
01:40:19,909 --> 01:40:23,868
But did you form an opinion as to
whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1559
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,073
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1560
01:40:26,182 --> 01:40:30,414
It's impossible to tell if a mature
married woman has been raped.

1561
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,044
That's all.

1562
01:40:32,155 --> 01:40:36,683
Did you have an opinion about whether
she had any recent relations with a man?

1563
01:40:36,793 --> 01:40:39,990
Well, as far as no sperm
was present...

1564
01:40:40,096 --> 01:40:42,530
it didn't appear she had
a recent relation with a man.

1565
01:40:42,632 --> 01:40:45,328
- That's all.
-Just one more question, Doctor.

1566
01:40:45,435 --> 01:40:47,869
The fact that no evidence was present
in her body...

1567
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:50,302
does not mean that
she was not raped, does it?

1568
01:40:50,406 --> 01:40:51,600
No.

1569
01:40:51,708 --> 01:40:54,074
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1570
01:40:54,177 --> 01:40:55,576
Yes, sir.

1571
01:40:55,678 --> 01:41:00,012
Violation is sufficient for rape.
There need not be a completion.

1572
01:41:00,116 --> 01:41:02,676
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1573
01:41:02,785 --> 01:41:06,186
The people recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand.

1574
01:41:06,289 --> 01:41:10,089
Since counsel for the defense
has forced the question of rape...

1575
01:41:10,193 --> 01:41:13,492
it becomes necessary to take this
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1576
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:16,330
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1577
01:41:16,432 --> 01:41:17,831
Mr. Paquette...

1578
01:41:19,602 --> 01:41:22,662
would you take a look at Mrs. Manion
seated there behind the defense table.

1579
01:41:22,772 --> 01:41:25,206
Was she dressed in this manner
the night of the shooting?

1580
01:41:25,308 --> 01:41:27,572
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1581
01:41:27,677 --> 01:41:32,478
She had on a real tight skirt and
sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.

1582
01:41:32,582 --> 01:41:35,210
She was wearing red shoes
with high heels.

1583
01:41:35,318 --> 01:41:38,719
- Was she wearing hose?
- No, she was bare-legged.

1584
01:41:38,821 --> 01:41:41,585
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1585
01:41:41,691 --> 01:41:45,354
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion
have under that hat?

1586
01:41:45,461 --> 01:41:48,953
We'd be very happy to show the court
Mrs. Manion's hair.

1587
01:41:49,065 --> 01:41:51,966
Mrs. Manion, would you
take off your hat, please?

1588
01:41:56,873 --> 01:41:59,467
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1589
01:41:59,575 --> 01:42:02,874
Was she wearing glasses
that night?

1590
01:42:02,979 --> 01:42:05,470
I think she was
when she played pinball.

1591
01:42:05,581 --> 01:42:10,018
Considering the tight skirt and
the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1592
01:42:10,119 --> 01:42:13,247
what was the result
in her appearance?

1593
01:42:13,356 --> 01:42:17,884
Would you say her appearance was
deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1594
01:42:17,994 --> 01:42:19,655
You could see everything she had.

1595
01:42:19,762 --> 01:42:23,357
The defense will concede that
Mrs. Manion when dressed informally...

1596
01:42:23,466 --> 01:42:26,663
is an astonishingly beautiful woman
and we...

1597
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:29,033
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please,
will you?

1598
01:42:29,138 --> 01:42:31,333
As a matter of fact...
Take your glasses off.

1599
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,672
It's pretty easy to understand why her
husband became temporarily deranged...

1600
01:42:35,778 --> 01:42:39,236
when he saw such beauty bruised
and torn by a beast!

1601
01:42:39,348 --> 01:42:41,543
Your Honor, I protest.

1602
01:42:41,651 --> 01:42:43,812
Mr. Biegler is perhaps
the least disciplined...

1603
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,321
and the most completely out of order
attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.

1604
01:42:47,423 --> 01:42:50,324
The jury will ignore
Mr. Biegler's oration.

1605
01:42:54,163 --> 01:42:57,132
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily
that night?

1606
01:42:57,233 --> 01:43:01,294
I sold her six drinks myself and
Barney came over and got more for her.

1607
01:43:01,404 --> 01:43:04,339
- I don't remember how many.
- Would you say she was tight?

1608
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,102
-She was high, all right.
-What did she do to make you think that?

1609
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:10,509
She took off her shoes
and went barefooted.

1610
01:43:10,613 --> 01:43:14,413
When she played pinball, she'd swish
around to give the machine English.

1611
01:43:14,517 --> 01:43:18,044
You mean she was flipping
her hips around?

1612
01:43:18,154 --> 01:43:21,146
- Yeah.
- Anything else?

1613
01:43:21,257 --> 01:43:26,058
When she made a good score, she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do.

1614
01:43:26,162 --> 01:43:28,528
She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night.

1615
01:43:28,631 --> 01:43:29,825
- Wasn't she?
- Yes.

1616
01:43:29,932 --> 01:43:32,230
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

1617
01:43:32,335 --> 01:43:35,395
- Friendly.
- More than friendly, would you say?

1618
01:43:35,504 --> 01:43:38,234
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?

1619
01:43:38,341 --> 01:43:41,367
She'd kind of lean on him.

1620
01:43:41,477 --> 01:43:43,377
A couple of times she bumped him
with her hip.

1621
01:43:45,147 --> 01:43:49,106
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1622
01:43:49,218 --> 01:43:52,949
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness.

1623
01:43:53,055 --> 01:43:55,455
I withdraw the question.
Would you say...

1624
01:43:55,558 --> 01:43:58,254
Mrs. Manion was free and easy
with Barney Quill?

1625
01:43:58,361 --> 01:44:00,386
- I would.
- Your witness.

1626
01:44:00,496 --> 01:44:01,963
Mr. Paquette...

1627
01:44:02,064 --> 01:44:05,898
the attorney for the people
asked you if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...

1628
01:44:06,002 --> 01:44:08,436
and you said
that she was "high."

1629
01:44:08,537 --> 01:44:12,598
Now, speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1630
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:17,008
- I don't understand.
- When we say a person's "tight"...

1631
01:44:17,113 --> 01:44:21,482
we usually mean they're a little stupid
with the drink, isn't that so?

1632
01:44:21,584 --> 01:44:23,449
I guess so.

1633
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:27,386
And if they're "high"
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1634
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:29,754
In other words,
Mrs. Manion was happy.

1635
01:44:29,859 --> 01:44:32,293
Is there anything wrong with being happy
in Thunder Bay Inn?

1636
01:44:32,395 --> 01:44:33,453
No.

1637
01:44:33,562 --> 01:44:36,395
Thunder Bay itself is a resort,
isn't it?

1638
01:44:36,499 --> 01:44:39,662
- Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing.
- Yes.

1639
01:44:39,769 --> 01:44:43,034
Is there anything unusual about seeing
a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1640
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:44,367
No.

1641
01:44:44,473 --> 01:44:46,964
So Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off
in Thunder Bay...

1642
01:44:47,076 --> 01:44:50,136
that doesn't mean
she's being unladylike, does it?

1643
01:44:50,246 --> 01:44:52,146
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1644
01:44:52,248 --> 01:44:53,647
No!

1645
01:44:55,451 --> 01:45:00,184
Now, you testified that
Mrs. Manion was squealing...

1646
01:45:00,289 --> 01:45:03,190
and jumping up and down...

1647
01:45:03,292 --> 01:45:05,954
and swishing her... I think that
was the expression you used...

1648
01:45:06,062 --> 01:45:08,428
swishing her hips
around the pinball machine.

1649
01:45:08,531 --> 01:45:12,399
Now, was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1650
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:15,766
Were the men at the bar all
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

1651
01:45:15,871 --> 01:45:18,396
- No.
- But you were very conscious of her.

1652
01:45:18,507 --> 01:45:21,169
Conscious enough so that you can tell us
all about her actions?

1653
01:45:21,277 --> 01:45:23,177
- Yes.
- And certainly Barney Quill...

1654
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:27,272
he was conscious of her because
he was playing pinball with her, right?

1655
01:45:27,383 --> 01:45:31,410
So it seems that only you
and Barney Quill were acutely aware...

1656
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,819
of Mrs. Manion and her actions
and her appearance.

1657
01:45:34,924 --> 01:45:37,552
Maybe good old Barney when he came up
to get some drinks from you...

1658
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:42,063
maybe he winked and said, "Alphonse,
I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."

1659
01:45:42,164 --> 01:45:44,223
- No, he didn't.
- Maybe you said...

1660
01:45:44,333 --> 01:45:46,233
" Do it once for me, boss."

1661
01:45:46,335 --> 01:45:48,326
Objection.

1662
01:45:48,437 --> 01:45:50,997
No more questions!

1663
01:45:51,107 --> 01:45:55,043
The court's had about all of this
dogfight it can take for one day.

1664
01:45:55,144 --> 01:45:58,671
And I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1665
01:45:58,781 --> 01:46:02,581
Tomorrow the defense takes over
and with expedition, prayer...

1666
01:46:02,685 --> 01:46:05,085
and a little self-discipline
on the part of counsel...

1667
01:46:05,187 --> 01:46:07,917
perhaps we can reach an end
by Saturday night.

1668
01:46:08,024 --> 01:46:10,822
Will you adjourn court?

1669
01:46:10,926 --> 01:46:12,655
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1670
01:46:12,762 --> 01:46:16,061
This court stands adjourned
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

1671
01:46:57,406 --> 01:47:00,307
He's banged up a little, but there
doesn't seem to be anything else.

1672
01:47:00,409 --> 01:47:02,900
We'd like to watch him
for a day or so.

1673
01:47:03,012 --> 01:47:05,606
How much damage did he do?

1674
01:47:05,714 --> 01:47:08,274
Wrecked a gate and a barn door.

1675
01:47:08,384 --> 01:47:10,784
He hasn't got a driver's license.

1676
01:47:12,054 --> 01:47:15,683
He'll have to appear
in theJ. P. court when he's able...

1677
01:47:15,791 --> 01:47:17,588
the old fool.

1678
01:47:17,693 --> 01:47:19,786
Speak kindly of the dead.

1679
01:47:19,895 --> 01:47:21,954
Mind if I have a minute
with the corpse?

1680
01:47:22,064 --> 01:47:23,622
Sure.

1681
01:47:27,136 --> 01:47:30,264
Now, was it worth trying
to kill yourself...

1682
01:47:30,372 --> 01:47:33,466
for whatever it is
you've been up to?

1683
01:47:33,576 --> 01:47:35,476
How is the trial going?

1684
01:47:35,578 --> 01:47:38,706
I'm making a lot of noise
and Dancer's racking up all the points.

1685
01:47:38,814 --> 01:47:41,942
But come on.
Where have you been?

1686
01:47:42,051 --> 01:47:46,420
Quill hired Mary Pilant up north
of Sault St. Marie.

1687
01:47:46,522 --> 01:47:50,822
Struck me funny he'd go all the way up
there to hire somebody to work for him.

1688
01:47:50,926 --> 01:47:52,985
I've been up there nosing around.

1689
01:47:53,095 --> 01:47:55,222
Did you find anything useful?

1690
01:47:55,331 --> 01:47:58,323
Not until I looked up
her birth certificate.

1691
01:47:58,434 --> 01:48:02,097
Born Blind River, Ontario, 1934...

1692
01:48:02,204 --> 01:48:04,104
out of wedlock.

1693
01:48:04,206 --> 01:48:08,199
Mother was a waitress,
Simone Pilant.

1694
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:12,508
Father was a lumberjack
named Barney Quill.

1695
01:48:20,022 --> 01:48:23,890
- I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.
- It's late, mister.

1696
01:48:23,993 --> 01:48:26,018
I know. This is important.

1697
01:48:26,128 --> 01:48:28,528
- Real important?
- Real important.

1698
01:48:33,469 --> 01:48:35,369
- Yes?
- Miss Pilant, sorry if I woke you.

1699
01:48:35,471 --> 01:48:37,871
There's a guy to see you.
Says it's real important.

1700
01:48:37,973 --> 01:48:39,873
- What's your...
- Paul Biegler.

1701
01:48:39,975 --> 01:48:42,876
- I don't wish to see him,
- Okay.

1702
01:48:44,113 --> 01:48:46,206
She said it's not important enough.

1703
01:48:46,315 --> 01:48:50,308
Call her back and tell her I mentioned
Blind River, Ontario.

1704
01:48:50,419 --> 01:48:52,649
I'll be in the bar.

1705
01:49:08,504 --> 01:49:10,404
Good evening, Alphonse.

1706
01:49:10,506 --> 01:49:12,736
Drinking or just snooping?

1707
01:49:12,841 --> 01:49:16,743
I think I'll try a little of both.
What do you say we start with a beer.

1708
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:24,884
On the house.
And that's all you get... a beer.

1709
01:49:24,987 --> 01:49:26,955
No questions, no answers.

1710
01:49:27,056 --> 01:49:29,524
I'm just a lawyer
trying to do my job.

1711
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:32,059
What are you so afraid of?

1712
01:49:35,097 --> 01:49:37,657
Let's sit over there, please.

1713
01:49:42,938 --> 01:49:46,999
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.
I was rough when I was here before.

1714
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:50,401
I didn't know Barney Quill
was your father.

1715
01:49:50,512 --> 01:49:53,310
You didn't come here
just to apologize.

1716
01:49:53,415 --> 01:49:55,349
No, but the apology was part of it.

1717
01:49:55,451 --> 01:50:00,081
To tell you the truth, I was hoping
it would thaw you out a little bit.

1718
01:50:00,189 --> 01:50:04,319
All I want you to do is listen to me,
just for a few minutes.

1719
01:50:04,426 --> 01:50:09,227
I need some strong evidence to back up
Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1720
01:50:09,331 --> 01:50:12,823
The prosecution's gonna attack
that story pretty hard.

1721
01:50:12,935 --> 01:50:15,426
And if the jury thinks she's lying...

1722
01:50:15,537 --> 01:50:18,301
that could turn the decision
against Manion.

1723
01:50:18,407 --> 01:50:20,466
Isn't she lying?

1724
01:50:20,576 --> 01:50:23,340
Barney didn't do what she said he did.
He couldn't have.

1725
01:50:23,445 --> 01:50:27,609
- What did you know about your father?
- All I needed to know.

1726
01:50:27,716 --> 01:50:31,675
He took care of me and my mother
for as long as she lived.

1727
01:50:31,787 --> 01:50:35,052
He was always there
when I needed him.

1728
01:50:35,157 --> 01:50:37,717
That's what I know about my father,
Mr. Biegler.

1729
01:50:37,826 --> 01:50:40,021
Will that back up
Laura Manion's story?

1730
01:50:40,129 --> 01:50:43,064
I don't want to get at you,
hurt you.

1731
01:50:43,165 --> 01:50:45,690
I appreciate your affection
for your father.

1732
01:50:45,801 --> 01:50:51,330
But as a lawyer I've had to learn
that people aren't just good or bad...

1733
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,738
but people are many things.

1734
01:50:53,842 --> 01:50:57,369
And I kind of have a feeling
Barney Quill was many things.

1735
01:50:57,479 --> 01:51:00,471
- I don't want to hear any more.
- No, please. Hear me out.

1736
01:51:00,582 --> 01:51:04,450
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette
what happened that night.

1737
01:51:04,553 --> 01:51:07,750
And he told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1738
01:51:07,856 --> 01:51:12,589
Barney stayed behind the bar
next to a gun rack, just waiting.

1739
01:51:12,695 --> 01:51:16,096
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1740
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:18,894
and the first shot
went right through Barney's heart.

1741
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:21,231
Now here's what I want you to do.

1742
01:51:21,337 --> 01:51:24,829
I want you to try to persuade Al
to come to the court...

1743
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:28,967
as a defense witness and tell the court
what Barney told him that night...

1744
01:51:29,078 --> 01:51:31,945
that he raped and assaulted
Mrs. Manion.

1745
01:51:32,047 --> 01:51:36,711
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?

1746
01:51:36,819 --> 01:51:40,016
I don't know.
But I know this.

1747
01:51:40,122 --> 01:51:43,683
Everybody loves something
or someone.

1748
01:51:43,792 --> 01:51:48,024
Me, I love fishing
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1749
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:51,622
Manion loves his freedom.
He'd like to have a little more of it.

1750
01:51:51,734 --> 01:51:55,761
Barney loved you.
Maybe so does Al.

1751
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:57,930
I wouldn't blame him.

1752
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:01,737
But he doesn't want to hurt you or
for you to know the truth about Barney...

1753
01:52:01,844 --> 01:52:03,937
that he could be dangerous
and brutal.

1754
01:52:04,046 --> 01:52:08,073
Now, if you just ask Al...
if you just ask him right straight out.

1755
01:52:18,494 --> 01:52:22,089
Al, Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1756
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:27,396
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed...

1757
01:52:27,503 --> 01:52:29,130
something you won't tell.

1758
01:52:29,238 --> 01:52:33,607
Lawyer, I told you once and I'll tell
you again... No questions, no answers.

1759
01:52:33,709 --> 01:52:35,267
Wait.

1760
01:52:37,413 --> 01:52:40,712
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1761
01:52:40,816 --> 01:52:43,046
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1762
01:52:44,653 --> 01:52:48,248
Is there any reason you wouldn't
tell me the truth about that?

1763
01:52:49,391 --> 01:52:51,256
What reason?

1764
01:52:57,232 --> 01:52:58,995
Anything else?

1765
01:52:59,935 --> 01:53:02,836
I'm going to leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1766
01:53:02,938 --> 01:53:06,704
You might like to watch
Lt. Manion get convicted.

1767
01:53:06,809 --> 01:53:09,073
You going to spread it around
about Mary being Barney's kid?

1768
01:53:09,178 --> 01:53:12,841
No, I'm not going to spread it
around, Al. Thank you for the beer.

1769
01:53:12,948 --> 01:53:14,848
Good night, Miss Pilant.

1770
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:21,487
All right. Let's get at
this rosary thing.

1771
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:24,650
It's been testified that your wife
swore to you on a rosary...

1772
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,194
that she'd been raped
by Barney Quill.

1773
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:29,787
Did you ask your wife
to swear on a rosary?

1774
01:53:31,033 --> 01:53:34,127
My wife was hysterical.
She wasn't making much sense.

1775
01:53:34,236 --> 01:53:37,364
I thought if I asked her to take
an oath on a rosary...

1776
01:53:37,473 --> 01:53:40,374
it might serve to calm her,
make her think more clearly.

1777
01:53:40,476 --> 01:53:42,467
Did the rosary help?

1778
01:53:42,578 --> 01:53:45,069
She was able to tell me
in detail what had happened.

1779
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:49,241
All right. Go on from there.
What did you do then, Lieutenant?

1780
01:53:49,351 --> 01:53:51,512
Well, I...

1781
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:55,021
I had her lie on the bed,
and I got some cold cloths...

1782
01:53:55,123 --> 01:53:57,216
for her head.

1783
01:53:57,326 --> 01:54:00,955
And, uh...
Oh, yes. I gave her a drink of brandy.

1784
01:54:03,098 --> 01:54:06,534
After a while, she became calm,
seemed to go to sleep.

1785
01:54:07,803 --> 01:54:10,101
Then I went to the closet...

1786
01:54:10,205 --> 01:54:12,332
I got my gun,
and I loaded it.

1787
01:54:12,441 --> 01:54:15,376
Was it in your mind
to kill Barney Quill?

1788
01:54:15,477 --> 01:54:16,637
No.

1789
01:54:16,745 --> 01:54:19,737
Then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1790
01:54:19,848 --> 01:54:23,306
I knew I had to go to Quill's place.
I thought I might need it.

1791
01:54:23,418 --> 01:54:25,249
Why?

1792
01:54:25,354 --> 01:54:28,050
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns
behind the bar.

1793
01:54:28,156 --> 01:54:29,817
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1794
01:54:29,925 --> 01:54:31,825
Might shoot you if you did what?

1795
01:54:31,927 --> 01:54:34,828
What were you going to do?

1796
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:37,057
I'm not sure.

1797
01:54:37,165 --> 01:54:39,827
I remember having some idea...

1798
01:54:39,935 --> 01:54:42,199
of finding him...

1799
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:45,330
and holding him
while I call the police.

1800
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,237
Well, that Mr. Whatshisname...

1801
01:54:47,342 --> 01:54:50,402
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court there,
he was a deputy sheriff.

1802
01:54:50,512 --> 01:54:52,912
Why didn't you get him
to go with you?

1803
01:54:53,015 --> 01:54:55,040
Maybe because he always
seemed to be just...

1804
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:57,345
the old caretaker of the park.

1805
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:02,178
Maybe because I wasn't thinking
about anything too clearly...

1806
01:55:02,291 --> 01:55:04,316
except finding Barney Quill.

1807
01:55:04,426 --> 01:55:08,123
Why didn't you go to a phone, call
the police before you went to the bar?

1808
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:10,391
I don't know.

1809
01:55:10,499 --> 01:55:13,696
I was in sort of a daze.

1810
01:55:13,802 --> 01:55:16,703
It was a horrible thing to see
what had been done to my wife.

1811
01:55:16,805 --> 01:55:18,966
Now, you say you were in
sort of a daze.

1812
01:55:19,074 --> 01:55:22,737
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1813
01:55:25,347 --> 01:55:28,145
I didn't see anyone at the bar...

1814
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:31,048
except Barney Quill.

1815
01:55:31,153 --> 01:55:34,418
- He was the only person I saw.
- What was he doing?

1816
01:55:35,557 --> 01:55:39,186
I think he was just standing there
behind the bar.

1817
01:55:39,294 --> 01:55:43,458
Now, did he make a threatening move
to get a gun?

1818
01:55:43,565 --> 01:55:47,001
I don't know.
May have. I don't know.

1819
01:55:47,102 --> 01:55:50,037
All right. Now, you say
you went there to find him...

1820
01:55:50,138 --> 01:55:52,072
to hold him for the police.

1821
01:55:52,174 --> 01:55:54,074
Why did you shoot him?

1822
01:55:55,944 --> 01:55:58,174
I don't remember shooting him.

1823
01:55:59,281 --> 01:56:02,182
Now, when you left the bar,
do you remember Alphonse Paquette...

1824
01:56:02,284 --> 01:56:04,252
coming up to you
and stopping you and saying...

1825
01:56:04,353 --> 01:56:07,288
"You'd better not run away from this,"
and you replied...

1826
01:56:07,389 --> 01:56:09,516
"You want some too, buster?"

1827
01:56:09,625 --> 01:56:12,389
Remember that?

1828
01:56:12,494 --> 01:56:16,328
I seem to have a vague recollection
of somebody speaking to me...

1829
01:56:17,699 --> 01:56:21,135
but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

1830
01:56:21,236 --> 01:56:24,137
When did you realize
that you'd shot Quill?

1831
01:56:26,908 --> 01:56:29,399
I was getting a drink of water.

1832
01:56:29,511 --> 01:56:32,571
I remember my throat was so dry
it hurt.

1833
01:56:34,016 --> 01:56:37,349
And when I put the glass down,
I saw the gun on the kitchen sink...

1834
01:56:37,452 --> 01:56:39,818
beside the tap.

1835
01:56:39,921 --> 01:56:41,821
I noticed the gun was empty.

1836
01:56:42,924 --> 01:56:45,722
Now, I'd like you to show
the court and jury...

1837
01:56:48,296 --> 01:56:50,787
just how you knew
this gun was empty.

1838
01:56:50,899 --> 01:56:53,390
Well, this gadget here...

1839
01:56:53,502 --> 01:56:57,268
when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1840
01:56:59,474 --> 01:57:02,568
On the night of the shooting,
did you love your wife?

1841
01:57:02,678 --> 01:57:05,909
- Yes, sir.
- Do you still love her?

1842
01:57:09,384 --> 01:57:11,750
Very much.

1843
01:57:11,853 --> 01:57:13,980
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1844
01:57:17,192 --> 01:57:19,558
How many men have you killed?

1845
01:57:19,661 --> 01:57:21,993
Now, wait a minute!

1846
01:57:22,097 --> 01:57:25,430
Your Honor, a man's war record...
in Lt. Manion's case, a great record...

1847
01:57:25,534 --> 01:57:27,559
certainly shouldn't be used
against him.

1848
01:57:27,669 --> 01:57:30,604
I'm as patriotic as the next man...

1849
01:57:30,706 --> 01:57:33,231
but the simple truth is,
war can condition a man...

1850
01:57:33,341 --> 01:57:35,502
to killing other men.

1851
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:38,204
I simply want to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may be...

1852
01:57:38,313 --> 01:57:41,771
to the use of firearms
on other human beings.

1853
01:57:41,883 --> 01:57:45,751
I don't like the question, Mr. Biegler,
but I don't see how I can exclude it.

1854
01:57:45,854 --> 01:57:47,549
Let him answer.

1855
01:57:47,656 --> 01:57:51,319
I know I killed
at least four men in Korea...

1856
01:57:51,426 --> 01:57:53,326
three with a hand grenade...

1857
01:57:53,428 --> 01:57:55,658
and one with my service automatic.

1858
01:57:55,764 --> 01:57:59,564
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1859
01:57:59,668 --> 01:58:01,898
Now, Lieutenant,
in these acts of killing...

1860
01:58:02,003 --> 01:58:05,632
did you ever have a lapse of memory such
as you had when you killed Barney Quill?

1861
01:58:05,741 --> 01:58:08,835
- No, sir.
- Did you ever have one during battle?

1862
01:58:08,944 --> 01:58:10,502
- No, sir.
- Were you ever submitted...

1863
01:58:10,612 --> 01:58:13,274
to a constant barrage,
constantly in a sweat for many hours...

1864
01:58:13,381 --> 01:58:15,645
- constantly under attack or attacking?
- Many times.

1865
01:58:15,751 --> 01:58:19,118
Were you ever treated for shell shock,
battle fatigue, neuroses or psychoses?

1866
01:58:19,221 --> 01:58:21,382
- No, sir.
- Did you ever experience...

1867
01:58:21,490 --> 01:58:24,084
any unusual mental state
during the war?

1868
01:58:24,192 --> 01:58:26,422
Well, I do remember having
one great urge.

1869
01:58:26,528 --> 01:58:30,362
- What was that?
- To get the hell out and go home.

1870
01:58:30,465 --> 01:58:33,025
You would do well to consider
the seriousness...

1871
01:58:33,135 --> 01:58:34,830
of the situation you're in.

1872
01:58:34,936 --> 01:58:37,928
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- I sympathize with the lieutenant.

1873
01:58:38,039 --> 01:58:42,032
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

1874
01:58:42,144 --> 01:58:44,305
But the main point here
is that at no time...

1875
01:58:44,412 --> 01:58:47,006
during your war service did you have
a record of mental disturbance.

1876
01:58:47,115 --> 01:58:49,310
You were always in complete possession
of your faculties.

1877
01:58:49,417 --> 01:58:51,783
Yes, sir. That's right.

1878
01:58:51,887 --> 01:58:54,685
- No more questions.
- No redirect, Your Honor.

1879
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:57,224
Step down, please.
Call your next witness.

1880
01:58:57,325 --> 01:58:59,919
We call Laura Manion
to the stand.

1881
01:59:12,174 --> 01:59:15,575
- Up these stairs and to the right.
- Thanks.

1882
01:59:21,483 --> 01:59:24,111
How long after you told
your husband what had happened...

1883
01:59:24,219 --> 01:59:26,346
did he leave the trailer?

1884
01:59:26,454 --> 01:59:28,445
I don't know exactly.

1885
01:59:28,557 --> 01:59:30,218
Everything was kind of fuzzy.

1886
01:59:30,325 --> 01:59:32,987
I was faint,
and I laid down on the bed.

1887
01:59:33,094 --> 01:59:35,153
He sat beside me.

1888
01:59:35,263 --> 01:59:38,198
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

1889
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:40,894
I remember wondering
if he was going for a doctor...

1890
01:59:41,002 --> 01:59:43,197
and then he came back in.

1891
01:59:43,305 --> 01:59:45,865
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must have been longer.

1892
01:59:45,974 --> 01:59:48,568
I must've gone to sleep.

1893
01:59:48,677 --> 01:59:51,578
When he came back in,
he sat on the bed...

1894
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:53,705
and he had a gun in his hand.

1895
01:59:53,815 --> 01:59:55,749
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

1896
01:59:56,918 --> 01:59:59,910
And he said,
"I think I've already done it.

1897
02:00:00,021 --> 02:00:02,216
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1898
02:00:02,324 --> 02:00:05,816
Are you sure he didn't say,
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

1899
02:00:05,927 --> 02:00:08,418
No, I remember distinctly.

1900
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:10,430
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1901
02:00:10,532 --> 02:00:12,500
Then what did you do?

1902
02:00:12,601 --> 02:00:16,867
I put my arms around him
and began to cry...

1903
02:00:16,972 --> 02:00:19,873
and I said,
"You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

1904
02:00:19,975 --> 02:00:21,966
And my husband said,
"I forgot about that."

1905
02:00:22,077 --> 02:00:24,807
What did he mean?
Forgot about what?

1906
02:00:24,913 --> 02:00:28,405
He meant he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

1907
02:00:28,516 --> 02:00:31,280
And he said, "Yes,
I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

1908
02:00:31,386 --> 02:00:32,717
Yes, I see.

1909
02:00:32,821 --> 02:00:36,120
Your Honor, I have no other
direct questions at this time.

1910
02:00:36,224 --> 02:00:39,216
But since I'm sure it's difficult
to visualize the part...

1911
02:00:39,327 --> 02:00:41,989
a little dog played on this night...

1912
02:00:42,097 --> 02:00:45,726
I should like a few minutes to show
the court this remarkable little animal.

1913
02:00:45,834 --> 02:00:47,825
Do the people object?

1914
02:00:47,936 --> 02:00:49,836
I'm sure that if we raise
an objection, Your Honor...

1915
02:00:49,938 --> 02:00:53,169
Mr. Biegler will declare that we are
haters of all small, furry animals.

1916
02:00:53,275 --> 02:00:57,234
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

1917
02:00:57,345 --> 02:00:59,336
Bring in the dog.

1918
02:00:59,447 --> 02:01:04,077
Thank you, sir. Will the deputy
bring in the dog, please?

1919
02:01:17,432 --> 02:01:19,627
You can put him right there.

1920
02:01:21,036 --> 02:01:23,129
Hey, Muff!. Come on!

1921
02:01:24,606 --> 02:01:27,370
That's a boy.

1922
02:01:27,475 --> 02:01:30,933
And now I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

1923
02:01:42,157 --> 02:01:46,560
I'll ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

1924
02:01:55,637 --> 02:01:58,902
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know
who his enemies are.

1925
02:01:59,007 --> 02:02:01,168
- Remove the dog, please.
- Yes, sir.

1926
02:02:01,276 --> 02:02:03,938
- The witness will resume the stand.
- There we go, Muff.

1927
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:11,644
May I congratulate you
on your well trained pet.

1928
02:02:11,753 --> 02:02:14,688
May I also say I'm pleased to see
you're not today...

1929
02:02:14,789 --> 02:02:17,053
hiding your lovely hair
under a hat.

1930
02:02:17,158 --> 02:02:20,855
Your Honor, is the assistant attorney
general from Lansing pitching woo...

1931
02:02:20,962 --> 02:02:24,693
- or is he going to cross-examine?
- Let's get on with it.

1932
02:02:24,799 --> 02:02:27,131
Mrs. Manion, what was your occupation
before you were married?

1933
02:02:27,235 --> 02:02:30,136
- Housewife.
- Then you've been married before?

1934
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:34,607
- Yes, once.
- I suppose your first husband died?

1935
02:02:34,709 --> 02:02:35,937
No.

1936
02:02:36,044 --> 02:02:38,740
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lt. Manion?

1937
02:02:38,847 --> 02:02:40,542
Your Honor, if counsel wants
to know the grounds...

1938
02:02:40,648 --> 02:02:42,912
for Mrs. Manion's divorce,
let him ask that question.

1939
02:02:43,018 --> 02:02:44,747
What were the grounds
for divorce?

1940
02:02:44,853 --> 02:02:47,913
- Mental cruelty.
- Naturally. And how long after...

1941
02:02:48,023 --> 02:02:50,651
your divorce was it
that you married Lt. Manion?

1942
02:02:50,759 --> 02:02:52,488
I'm not sure.

1943
02:02:52,594 --> 02:02:55,654
May I refresh the witness' memory
for Mr. Dancer?

1944
02:02:55,764 --> 02:02:57,891
- By all means.
- I believe she told me...

1945
02:02:57,999 --> 02:03:01,230
that they were married
three days after the divorce.

1946
02:03:01,336 --> 02:03:03,600
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.
Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?

1947
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,531
Then unless yours was
a whirlwind courtship...

1948
02:03:07,642 --> 02:03:09,735
you must have known Lt. Manion
before your divorce.

1949
02:03:09,844 --> 02:03:11,937
- Did you?
- Yes.

1950
02:03:12,047 --> 02:03:14,572
Mrs. Manion, what is your...

1951
02:03:14,682 --> 02:03:16,673
religious affiliation?

1952
02:03:16,785 --> 02:03:20,152
- I'm a Catholic.
- Catholic in good standing?

1953
02:03:20,255 --> 02:03:22,155
Well, no. The divorce, you know.

1954
02:03:22,257 --> 02:03:24,817
You mean you were excommunicated
because of the divorce and remarriage.

1955
02:03:24,926 --> 02:03:26,154
Yes.

1956
02:03:26,261 --> 02:03:28,957
Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say
that a Catholic...

1957
02:03:29,064 --> 02:03:32,693
who can blithely ignore one of
the cardinal rules of her church...

1958
02:03:32,801 --> 02:03:36,328
could also easily ignore an oath
taken on one of its artifacts...

1959
02:03:36,438 --> 02:03:38,838
say, an oath taken on a rosary?

1960
02:03:40,408 --> 02:03:42,672
I don't think that's true.

1961
02:03:42,777 --> 02:03:46,144
Wouldn't you think there'd be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person?

1962
02:03:47,048 --> 02:03:48,948
I don't know.

1963
02:03:49,050 --> 02:03:51,484
All I know is the rosary
means something to me.

1964
02:03:51,586 --> 02:03:55,920
I see.
Well, I'll pass on to something else.

1965
02:03:56,024 --> 02:03:58,390
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that your husband...

1966
02:03:58,493 --> 02:04:00,723
came home late from his work
on the night of the shooting.

1967
02:04:00,829 --> 02:04:02,729
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

1968
02:04:02,831 --> 02:04:06,392
- I guess I was a little put out.
- Did you have an argument?

1969
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:08,401
Not much. A little.

1970
02:04:08,503 --> 02:04:10,664
When you left the trailer
to go to the inn...

1971
02:04:10,772 --> 02:04:13,798
- did your husband know you were going?
- He was asleep.

1972
02:04:13,908 --> 02:04:16,069
Was part of your reason for going
without his knowledge...

1973
02:04:16,177 --> 02:04:18,372
because you were vexed?

1974
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:23,009
Well, I'd been ironing all day,
and I...

1975
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:25,609
- Yes, I guess that's true.
- Your Honor, the counsel...

1976
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:28,018
has deliberately
cut off my view of the witness.

1977
02:04:28,123 --> 02:04:31,820
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't want
to interfere with your signals to her.

1978
02:04:31,926 --> 02:04:34,486
I object to the implication
I was signaling the witness.

1979
02:04:34,596 --> 02:04:37,588
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick
I've ever seen.

1980
02:04:37,699 --> 02:04:41,863
- You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.
- I ask for a rule on my objection.

1981
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:44,461
Mr. Dancer, will you be careful
not to place yourself...

1982
02:04:44,572 --> 02:04:46,563
between Mr. Biegler and his witness?

1983
02:04:46,674 --> 02:04:48,642
Of course, Your Honor.

1984
02:04:48,743 --> 02:04:51,541
- Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
- You do it once more...

1985
02:04:51,646 --> 02:04:55,980
I'll punch you all the way out
into the middle of Lake Superior.

1986
02:04:56,084 --> 02:04:58,245
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

1987
02:04:58,353 --> 02:05:00,548
This rowing has got to stop.

1988
02:05:00,655 --> 02:05:04,591
The next one of you that speaks
out of turn will have me to deal with.

1989
02:05:04,692 --> 02:05:06,922
Get on with your cross-examination.

1990
02:05:07,028 --> 02:05:10,259
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had been awake?

1991
02:05:10,365 --> 02:05:13,766
- He probably would have gone with me.
- But would you have gone alone?

1992
02:05:13,868 --> 02:05:18,100
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

1993
02:05:18,206 --> 02:05:20,800
I'm not sure.
I don't know how to answer that.

1994
02:05:20,909 --> 02:05:23,503
Had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn, or...

1995
02:05:23,611 --> 02:05:26,512
elsewhere in Thunder Bay alone
at night?

1996
02:05:26,614 --> 02:05:29,845
- Yes, sometimes.
- Did your husband know you were going?

1997
02:05:29,951 --> 02:05:33,079
Not always.
He goes to sleep early...

1998
02:05:33,188 --> 02:05:35,918
and sometimes I'm restless.

1999
02:05:36,024 --> 02:05:39,824
- Where did you go on these occasions?
- I'd take a walk by the lake, or...

2000
02:05:39,928 --> 02:05:43,386
go into the bingo place,
maybe to the inn.

2001
02:05:43,498 --> 02:05:46,194
You ever go to meet another man?

2002
02:05:46,301 --> 02:05:48,269
No, I didn't.
I never did that.

2003
02:05:48,369 --> 02:05:51,236
You mean to say, Mrs. Manion,
a lovely women like yourself...

2004
02:05:51,339 --> 02:05:54,740
attractive to men, lonely, restless,
that you never once met...

2005
02:05:54,842 --> 02:05:57,834
Objection, Your Honor. The witness has
answered the question about other men.

2006
02:05:57,946 --> 02:06:00,710
The counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

2007
02:06:00,815 --> 02:06:02,806
I withdraw the question.

2008
02:06:02,917 --> 02:06:07,320
Mrs. Manion, on these occasional
excursions into the night...

2009
02:06:07,422 --> 02:06:09,982
did you always go
and return home alone?

2010
02:06:10,091 --> 02:06:11,524
Of course.

2011
02:06:11,626 --> 02:06:13,890
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that the reason you got...

2012
02:06:13,995 --> 02:06:17,624
into Barney Quill's car was because
you were afraid to go home alone.

2013
02:06:17,732 --> 02:06:19,700
Why were you so frightened
on this night?

2014
02:06:19,801 --> 02:06:24,238
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

2015
02:06:24,339 --> 02:06:26,534
Was this the first time
you heard that...

2016
02:06:26,641 --> 02:06:28,632
bears came around Thunder Bay
for scraps?

2017
02:06:28,743 --> 02:06:31,507
- No.
- Had you seen the bears before?

2018
02:06:31,613 --> 02:06:32,671
Yes.

2019
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:35,180
Oh, this was just the first time
you were afraid of them.

2020
02:06:35,283 --> 02:06:37,513
No, I was always afraid of them.

2021
02:06:37,619 --> 02:06:40,417
Oh, this was just the first time
you were enough afraid to allow...

2022
02:06:40,521 --> 02:06:43,081
a man to take you home
from one of your evening prowls.

2023
02:06:43,191 --> 02:06:46,854
Objection. Use of the word "prowls."
Meant to mislead the jury.

2024
02:06:46,961 --> 02:06:50,021
- Sustained.
- I apologize, Mrs. Manion.

2025
02:06:50,131 --> 02:06:52,895
I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

2026
02:06:53,001 --> 02:06:55,663
Was this the first time that
you were enough afraid to allow a man...

2027
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:58,967
to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

2028
02:06:59,073 --> 02:07:01,906
Well, it wasn't just that.

2029
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:03,910
- It was...
- Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.

2030
02:07:04,012 --> 02:07:06,446
You should be able to answer that
straight off. That's a simple question.

2031
02:07:06,547 --> 02:07:09,209
Your Honor, how can the witness
answer straight off...

2032
02:07:09,317 --> 02:07:11,512
when the counsel keeps interrupting
the answer?

2033
02:07:11,619 --> 02:07:14,782
The witness seemed
a little slow to me, Mr. Biegler.

2034
02:07:14,889 --> 02:07:17,824
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

2035
02:07:17,925 --> 02:07:20,393
Of course, Your Honor. In any case,
Mr. Biegler's objection...

2036
02:07:20,495 --> 02:07:23,487
has given Mr. Manion sufficient time
to think of an answer to my question.

2037
02:07:23,598 --> 02:07:25,498
You've thought of one, haven't you?

2038
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:29,036
What I was going to say was that
I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...

2039
02:07:29,137 --> 02:07:32,334
by making him think that I was
afraid of him or didn't like him.

2040
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:35,932
He's been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

2041
02:07:36,044 --> 02:07:38,035
That's very good, Mrs. Manion.
Very good, indeed.

2042
02:07:38,146 --> 02:07:41,115
- Your Honor, please.
- The attorney for the people...

2043
02:07:41,215 --> 02:07:43,979
will reserve his comments
for the arguments.

2044
02:07:44,085 --> 02:07:47,282
I will ask you this question,
Mrs. Manion.

2045
02:07:47,388 --> 02:07:52,451
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

2046
02:07:54,996 --> 02:07:58,363
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

2047
02:07:58,466 --> 02:08:00,832
Yes, I heard.

2048
02:08:00,935 --> 02:08:03,836
Yes, it was the first time.

2049
02:08:03,938 --> 02:08:06,634
Would you raise your voice
a little, Mrs. Manion?

2050
02:08:06,741 --> 02:08:09,938
I said it was the first time.

2051
02:08:10,044 --> 02:08:12,137
Now, Mrs. Manion...

2052
02:08:12,246 --> 02:08:14,840
I'm quite concerned
about the lost panties.

2053
02:08:14,949 --> 02:08:17,918
Would you describe this article
of clothing to the courtroom?

2054
02:08:19,554 --> 02:08:22,421
They were nylon,
and had lace up the sides.

2055
02:08:22,523 --> 02:08:24,991
There was a label in them
of the place I got them...

2056
02:08:25,093 --> 02:08:28,620
- The Smart Shop in Phoenix, Arizona.
- What was the color of the panties?

2057
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:30,664
- I believe, white.
- You believe?

2058
02:08:30,765 --> 02:08:33,063
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

2059
02:08:33,167 --> 02:08:34,862
You're not sure?
Haven't you checked your lingerie...

2060
02:08:34,969 --> 02:08:36,937
to see which pair of panties
is missing?

2061
02:08:37,038 --> 02:08:38,835
- No.
- When your husband came home late...

2062
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:43,172
from work, and you had this little spat,
were you already dressed to go out?

2063
02:08:43,277 --> 02:08:45,177
- No.
- When did you dress?

2064
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:47,008
After dinner, when he was asleep.

2065
02:08:47,115 --> 02:08:51,017
It's been stated here that you were
bare legged in the bar. Is that true?

2066
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,747
In your anger at your husband and
your haste to get out of the trailer...

2067
02:08:53,855 --> 02:08:55,652
perhaps you didn't put on
any panties either.

2068
02:08:55,757 --> 02:08:58,692
Objection. Witness has already testified
of what she was wearing.

2069
02:08:58,793 --> 02:09:01,284
- Sustained.
- Do you always wear panties?

2070
02:09:01,396 --> 02:09:04,263
Your Honor, I object
to this line of questioning.

2071
02:09:04,365 --> 02:09:07,061
It's immaterial what Mrs. Manion
does all the time.

2072
02:09:07,168 --> 02:09:09,500
On the night she was attacked,
she was wearing panties...

2073
02:09:09,604 --> 02:09:11,902
and that's all we're concerned with.

2074
02:09:12,006 --> 02:09:15,942
Mrs. Manion seems a little bit uncertain
about the kind of panties she wore.

2075
02:09:16,043 --> 02:09:19,103
And since these panties have not been
found, I submit that it's possible...

2076
02:09:19,213 --> 02:09:21,681
she wasn't wearing any
and has forgotten.

2077
02:09:21,783 --> 02:09:26,049
- That's all I'm trying to get at.
- You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2078
02:09:26,154 --> 02:09:29,317
You always wear panties?

2079
02:09:29,424 --> 02:09:31,255
No.

2080
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:34,351
On what occasions don't you wear them?
When you go out alone at night?

2081
02:09:34,462 --> 02:09:38,364
No, no. Objection. He says he's going
after one thing and goes after another.

2082
02:09:38,466 --> 02:09:40,400
I'll sustain the objection.

2083
02:09:40,501 --> 02:09:44,096
Strike out the last two questions
in Mrs. Manion's answer.

2084
02:09:44,205 --> 02:09:48,642
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.

2085
02:09:48,743 --> 02:09:50,734
Yes, Your Honor.

2086
02:09:50,845 --> 02:09:54,941
Mrs. Manion,
is your husband a jealous man?

2087
02:09:55,049 --> 02:09:58,280
- He loves me.
- I'm sure, but is he overly jealous?

2088
02:09:58,386 --> 02:10:01,184
Your Honor, how can the witness
answer that question?

2089
02:10:01,289 --> 02:10:03,223
What's the norm of jealousy?

2090
02:10:03,324 --> 02:10:06,350
Can you put your question
a little differently, Mr. Dancer?

2091
02:10:06,461 --> 02:10:09,294
- Has your husband struck you in a rage?
- No, Your Honor.

2092
02:10:09,397 --> 02:10:12,628
I think Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevance of this question?

2093
02:10:12,733 --> 02:10:14,860
Your Honor, the shoe is squeezing
Mr. Biegler's foot.

2094
02:10:14,969 --> 02:10:16,869
In his own words,
this is not a high school debate.

2095
02:10:16,971 --> 02:10:19,132
This is a cross-examination
in a murder trial.

2096
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,140
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2097
02:10:25,646 --> 02:10:28,843
Did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2098
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:30,781
Yes, a few times.

2099
02:10:30,885 --> 02:10:33,752
When your husband's outfit moved
to Thunder Bay, didn't Barney Quill...

2100
02:10:33,855 --> 02:10:37,313
throw a cocktail party
for the officers and their wives?

2101
02:10:37,425 --> 02:10:40,394
Didn't your husband strike a young
second lieutenant at this party?

2102
02:10:41,462 --> 02:10:44,625
There was a little scuffle.
It wasn't much.

2103
02:10:44,732 --> 02:10:47,997
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2104
02:10:48,102 --> 02:10:51,697
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2105
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:55,165
I think it was because...

2106
02:10:55,276 --> 02:10:59,269
the lieutenant was cutting in too much
when I was dancing with my husband.

2107
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:02,543
Shortly after on the verandah, didn't
your husband slap you hard enough...

2108
02:11:02,650 --> 02:11:04,845
so that you fell against the wall?

2109
02:11:07,421 --> 02:11:09,912
- He was drinking.
- Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2110
02:11:10,024 --> 02:11:14,188
- I don't know!
- Do you remember why he struck you?

2111
02:11:14,295 --> 02:11:18,595
Wasn't he enraged at you because he
thought you'd encouraged the young man?

2112
02:11:18,699 --> 02:11:21,600
- He might have thought so.
- There are witnesses to this affair.

2113
02:11:21,702 --> 02:11:24,296
I'll ask you again.
Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2114
02:11:24,405 --> 02:11:26,703
I guess you could call it that.

2115
02:11:28,209 --> 02:11:31,736
Now I'll ask you.

2116
02:11:31,846 --> 02:11:34,280
On the night of the shooting...

2117
02:11:34,382 --> 02:11:36,179
what did you swear?

2118
02:11:36,284 --> 02:11:38,479
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2119
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:43,520
- It was about Barney Quill raping me.
- Why did you swear on the rosary...

2120
02:11:43,624 --> 02:11:45,854
that he raped you?

2121
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,588
For the reason my husband said...
because I was hysterical!

2122
02:11:48,696 --> 02:11:51,290
That was the reason he gave for asking
you to swear. What was it for swearing?

2123
02:11:51,399 --> 02:11:53,333
- So he'd believe me.
- Why shouldn't he?

2124
02:11:53,434 --> 02:11:56,631
Objection! The reason for the use
of the rosary has been established.

2125
02:11:56,737 --> 02:11:58,329
These questions are immaterial.

2126
02:11:58,439 --> 02:12:02,034
No, I think I'll take
the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2127
02:12:02,143 --> 02:12:05,704
I'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2128
02:12:07,615 --> 02:12:09,742
Because I wasn't making much sense!

2129
02:12:09,850 --> 02:12:11,647
Did he think you'd lie
about a thing like that?

2130
02:12:11,752 --> 02:12:15,313
Objection, Your Honor! Lt. Manion had
already testified as to what he thought!

2131
02:12:15,423 --> 02:12:19,359
-Sustained.
-Did your husband strike you that night?

2132
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:21,018
Did he hit you that night?

2133
02:12:23,998 --> 02:12:26,091
Well, he...

2134
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:29,567
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

2135
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:32,138
Didn't you swear to a lie to keep him
from hitting you again?

2136
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:34,139
No, I didn't! I did not!

2137
02:12:34,241 --> 02:12:37,438
Hadn't he already beaten you up when he
caught you coming home with Quill?

2138
02:12:37,545 --> 02:12:41,777
Objection! The witness has already
testified she was beaten by Quill!

2139
02:12:41,882 --> 02:12:44,009
Quiet. Quiet.

2140
02:12:44,118 --> 02:12:46,814
No more questions.

2141
02:12:46,921 --> 02:12:49,481
I think the witness
has had enough, Your Honor.

2142
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:52,821
The witness may step down.
We'll recess for lunch.

2143
02:12:54,862 --> 02:12:56,762
Recess until 1:00.

2144
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,700
I'm sorry, baby.
You were fine.

2145
02:13:35,202 --> 02:13:37,261
Dr. Smith.

2146
02:13:37,371 --> 02:13:40,033
I've come to meet you.
My name is...

2147
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:42,871
- I'm sorry. You've been mistaken.
- Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.

2148
02:13:42,977 --> 02:13:44,945
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2149
02:13:45,046 --> 02:13:47,514
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2150
02:13:47,615 --> 02:13:50,379
- Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith.
- That's me.

2151
02:13:50,484 --> 02:13:52,679
The army psychiatrist?

2152
02:13:52,787 --> 02:13:55,051
Maybe you expected me
to be in uniform.

2153
02:13:55,156 --> 02:13:57,283
No.

2154
02:13:57,391 --> 02:13:59,882
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2155
02:13:59,994 --> 02:14:01,894
I'm 40.

2156
02:14:01,996 --> 02:14:04,931
I sort of hoped you'd...

2157
02:14:05,032 --> 02:14:07,432
have a beard and wear a monocle.

2158
02:14:07,535 --> 02:14:09,628
I see.

2159
02:14:09,737 --> 02:14:12,137
Is that better?

2160
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:14,605
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2161
02:14:17,078 --> 02:14:19,842
Doctor, have you formed an opinion
as to Frederick Manion's...

2162
02:14:19,947 --> 02:14:22,882
mental and emotional state
at the time he killed Barney Quill?

2163
02:14:22,983 --> 02:14:24,610
- I have.
- And what is that opinion?

2164
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:27,711
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2165
02:14:27,822 --> 02:14:30,017
At the time of the shooting,
do you believe he was able...

2166
02:14:30,124 --> 02:14:32,251
to distinguish right from wrong?

2167
02:14:32,359 --> 02:14:35,419
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make too much difference.

2168
02:14:35,529 --> 02:14:38,589
Now, Doctor,
as clearly as you can...

2169
02:14:38,699 --> 02:14:42,260
will you explain
Frederick Manion's temporary insanity?

2170
02:14:42,369 --> 02:14:45,395
It is known as dissociative reaction...

2171
02:14:45,506 --> 02:14:47,838
a psychic shock which creates...

2172
02:14:47,942 --> 02:14:50,240
an almost overwhelming tension...

2173
02:14:50,344 --> 02:14:53,245
which the person in shock
must alleviate.

2174
02:14:53,347 --> 02:14:55,872
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...

2175
02:14:55,983 --> 02:14:58,816
it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2176
02:14:58,919 --> 02:15:01,479
Only direct, simple action...

2177
02:15:01,589 --> 02:15:05,047
against Barney Quill would relieve
this unbearable tension.

2178
02:15:05,159 --> 02:15:08,788
This is not too uncommon. For example,
in combat, some of the more...

2179
02:15:08,896 --> 02:15:11,729
remarkable heroics take place
in this state of mind.

2180
02:15:11,832 --> 02:15:15,962
Is there another name for dissociative
reaction that we might recognize?

2181
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:19,369
Yes, it has been known
as irresistible impulse.

2182
02:15:19,473 --> 02:15:22,704
Now, Doctor, a man in the grip
of irresistible impulse...

2183
02:15:22,810 --> 02:15:25,176
would he be likely to go
to his neighbor for advice...

2184
02:15:25,279 --> 02:15:27,975
or call up the police
to come to his aid?

2185
02:15:28,082 --> 02:15:30,915
- Completely incompatible.
- Yes, but our man...

2186
02:15:31,018 --> 02:15:33,646
was able to think of going
and taking out a gun...

2187
02:15:33,754 --> 02:15:36,120
and loading it before setting out
to find Quill.

2188
02:15:36,223 --> 02:15:40,626
That's his conscious mind working, but
he'd go even if a gun wasn't available.

2189
02:15:40,728 --> 02:15:44,357
How would a man look
in the grip of dissociative reaction?

2190
02:15:44,465 --> 02:15:48,492
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2191
02:15:48,602 --> 02:15:51,162
Mm-hmm.
Would you describe his behavior...

2192
02:15:51,272 --> 02:15:54,105
as being like a mailman
delivering the mail?

2193
02:15:54,208 --> 02:15:58,042
That's not bad. Like a mailman, he would
have a job to do, and he would do it.

2194
02:16:00,014 --> 02:16:02,482
- Your witness.
- Doctor...

2195
02:16:02,583 --> 02:16:05,017
did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2196
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:07,053
- I did not.
- Any neuroses?

2197
02:16:07,154 --> 02:16:09,088
I found no history of neuroses.

2198
02:16:09,190 --> 02:16:12,159
Any history of delusion?

2199
02:16:12,259 --> 02:16:14,159
- None.
- Loss of memory?

2200
02:16:14,261 --> 02:16:17,389
- Not before this instance.
- Did you find any history...

2201
02:16:17,498 --> 02:16:21,832
- Can you spot Mary Pilant?
- She didn't come back after lunch.

2202
02:16:21,936 --> 02:16:24,598
I think you'd better give up
on that one.

2203
02:16:24,705 --> 02:16:27,503
Doctor, you stated that the defendant
might or might not...

2204
02:16:27,608 --> 02:16:29,576
have been able to distinguish...

2205
02:16:29,677 --> 02:16:32,407
the difference between right and wrong,
but it wouldn't have made a difference.

2206
02:16:32,513 --> 02:16:34,640
- Am I right? Is that what you said?
- Approximately, yes.

2207
02:16:34,748 --> 02:16:36,682
Did you mean that at the time
of the shooting...

2208
02:16:36,784 --> 02:16:38,649
he could have known the difference
between right and wrong?

2209
02:16:38,752 --> 02:16:40,652
He might have, yes.

2210
02:16:40,754 --> 02:16:42,585
Dr. Smith...

2211
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:45,625
if the defendant could have known
what he was doing...

2212
02:16:45,726 --> 02:16:48,160
and could have known it was wrong,
how can you come here...

2213
02:16:48,262 --> 02:16:50,355
and testify that he was legally insane?

2214
02:16:50,464 --> 02:16:52,932
I'm not saying
he was legally insane.

2215
02:16:53,033 --> 02:16:54,967
I'm saying that
in his mental condition...

2216
02:16:55,069 --> 02:16:57,594
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong.

2217
02:16:57,705 --> 02:17:00,265
He would still have shot Quill.

2218
02:17:02,509 --> 02:17:06,343
Are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2219
02:17:06,447 --> 02:17:08,347
Yes, I am.

2220
02:17:09,750 --> 02:17:12,446
Your Honor, I'd like to ask
for a short recess.

2221
02:17:12,553 --> 02:17:16,489
The attorneys for the people would like
to meet with Mr. Biegler in chambers.

2222
02:17:17,391 --> 02:17:20,451
- Glad to oblige, Your Honor.
- Short recess.

2223
02:17:20,561 --> 02:17:22,529
The jury will remain.

2224
02:17:33,707 --> 02:17:35,800
Someday, I'm going to
horrify tradition...

2225
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:38,401
and lay a dense, blue cloud...

2226
02:17:38,512 --> 02:17:41,606
of tobacco smoke
in that hallowed courtroom.

2227
02:17:41,715 --> 02:17:43,979
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2228
02:17:44,084 --> 02:17:46,416
Your Honor, in view of Dr. Smith's
testimony, I thought perhaps...

2229
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,488
the defense might like
to change their plea.

2230
02:17:48,589 --> 02:17:51,387
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2231
02:17:51,492 --> 02:17:53,426
No, we'll still go for broke.

2232
02:17:53,527 --> 02:17:56,087
Hell, Paulie, you know a guy's
not considered legally nuts...

2233
02:17:56,196 --> 02:17:58,221
in Michigan unless
he didn't know right from wrong.

2234
02:17:58,332 --> 02:18:02,792
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honor, will you turn to page 486?

2235
02:18:02,903 --> 02:18:07,067
- What's that?
- Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2236
02:18:08,943 --> 02:18:10,968
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

2237
02:18:11,078 --> 02:18:13,603
I make those things
to help me think sometimes.

2238
02:18:13,714 --> 02:18:16,080
- For perch?
- No, it was for frog.

2239
02:18:16,183 --> 02:18:18,117
What case is he citing?

2240
02:18:18,218 --> 02:18:20,413
We gig frogs
in my part of the country.

2241
02:18:20,521 --> 02:18:23,217
It's the same up here.
I'm a trout man, myself...

2242
02:18:23,324 --> 02:18:25,315
but this is a new wrinkle
I'm gonna try.

2243
02:18:25,426 --> 02:18:29,328
They do it in the Bayou, down South.
The idea, they get a big, long pole...

2244
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:31,728
and about a ten-pound line,
just sort of...

2245
02:18:31,832 --> 02:18:33,891
drift along a high bank
in a boat.

2246
02:18:34,001 --> 02:18:37,903
Then you see that big, old bullfrog
in the crevice...

2247
02:18:38,005 --> 02:18:40,098
and sort of float this along
in front of him.

2248
02:18:40,207 --> 02:18:42,937
Pop! That old tongue of his
snaps out, and...

2249
02:18:43,043 --> 02:18:45,011
You've got frog legs
for supper.

2250
02:18:45,112 --> 02:18:47,103
- I'll be darned.
- Why don't you keep it?

2251
02:18:47,214 --> 02:18:50,047
- Try it sometime.
- Thanks. I will.

2252
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:52,084
Four eighty-six.

2253
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:57,654
- What is it, Your Honor?
- People v, Durfee, 1886.

2254
02:18:57,758 --> 02:19:00,386
Looks like a precedent.

2255
02:19:00,494 --> 02:19:02,485
Would you like to read it?

2256
02:19:03,597 --> 02:19:07,192
No, thank you, Your Honor.
I think I recall the case.

2257
02:19:08,302 --> 02:19:11,135
We're hooked...

2258
02:19:11,238 --> 02:19:13,138
like the frog.

2259
02:19:16,143 --> 02:19:18,873
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

2260
02:19:18,946 --> 02:19:20,880
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.

2261
02:19:20,981 --> 02:19:23,040
And where do you practice now?

2262
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:26,745
I'm the medical superintendent of the
Bonder State Hospital for the Insane.

2263
02:19:26,854 --> 02:19:29,049
It's been stated here that...

2264
02:19:29,156 --> 02:19:32,057
dissociative reaction,
or irresistible impulse...

2265
02:19:32,159 --> 02:19:34,992
is not uncommon
among soldiers in combat.

2266
02:19:35,095 --> 02:19:37,825
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do...

2267
02:19:37,931 --> 02:19:39,922
but not as it was put
by Dr. Smith.

2268
02:19:40,034 --> 02:19:43,800
- Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
- Dissociative reaction...

2269
02:19:43,904 --> 02:19:47,635
is not something that comes out of
the blue and disappears as quickly.

2270
02:19:47,741 --> 02:19:51,973
It can only occur,
even among soldiers in combat...

2271
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:56,015
if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

2272
02:19:56,116 --> 02:19:59,779
It's been testified here that
a psychiatric exam of the defendant...

2273
02:19:59,887 --> 02:20:02,447
showed no evidence of neuroses...

2274
02:20:02,556 --> 02:20:04,888
and no history
of dissociative reaction.

2275
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,960
You've further heard it testified...

2276
02:20:07,061 --> 02:20:09,052
that the defendant's behavior
on the night of the shooting...

2277
02:20:09,163 --> 02:20:11,723
was cool and direct.

2278
02:20:11,832 --> 02:20:15,393
As an observer,
do you remember this testimony?

2279
02:20:15,502 --> 02:20:18,733
From this, have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity...

2280
02:20:18,839 --> 02:20:20,773
on the night of the shooting?

2281
02:20:20,874 --> 02:20:24,810
I'm of the opinion that he was in
possession of his faculties...

2282
02:20:24,912 --> 02:20:27,574
so that he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2283
02:20:27,681 --> 02:20:31,515
In other words, he was not
in the grip of irresistible impulse.

2284
02:20:31,618 --> 02:20:33,848
- In my opinion, he was not.
- Thank you. Your witness.

2285
02:20:33,954 --> 02:20:37,947
Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry is an effort
to probe into the dark...

2286
02:20:38,058 --> 02:20:40,026
undiscovered world of the mind.

2287
02:20:40,127 --> 02:20:43,392
And in there, the world
might be round, it could be square.

2288
02:20:43,497 --> 02:20:47,194
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's
could be right. Is that true?

2289
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:49,963
I'd be a poor doctor
if I didn't agree with that.

2290
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:53,471
But I believe my opinion
to be right.

2291
02:20:53,574 --> 02:20:55,974
Do you think you might've changed
your opinion...

2292
02:20:56,076 --> 02:20:58,704
if you'd examined the defendant
as Dr. Smith did?

2293
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:01,910
- I don't believe so.
- But Dr. Smith's opinion...

2294
02:21:02,015 --> 02:21:04,108
was made under better circumstances,
wasn't it?

2295
02:21:04,218 --> 02:21:07,244
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2296
02:21:07,354 --> 02:21:10,755
- Yeah. Thank you, Doctor.
- That's all, Dr. Harcourt.

2297
02:21:10,858 --> 02:21:14,726
- Is there more rebuttal?
- We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2298
02:21:14,828 --> 02:21:17,422
We have to use him.

2299
02:21:17,531 --> 02:21:20,159
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2300
02:21:20,267 --> 02:21:22,292
Will the sheriff please
bring in the witness?

2301
02:21:28,909 --> 02:21:31,275
What can he tell?

2302
02:21:31,378 --> 02:21:33,938
Nothing.

2303
02:21:34,047 --> 02:21:35,947
He can't tell anything.

2304
02:21:46,793 --> 02:21:50,160
Raise your right hand. Do you swear
the testimony you give in this cause...

2305
02:21:50,264 --> 02:21:53,233
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2306
02:21:53,333 --> 02:21:55,233
I do.

2307
02:21:57,204 --> 02:22:01,504
- State your name, please.
- Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.

2308
02:22:01,608 --> 02:22:03,508
Where do you presently reside?

2309
02:22:03,610 --> 02:22:05,669
Across the alley in the jail.

2310
02:22:05,779 --> 02:22:07,974
You know the defendant,
Frederick Manion?

2311
02:22:08,081 --> 02:22:10,914
Yeah, I got to know him in the past
few weeks. His cell's next to mine.

2312
02:22:11,018 --> 02:22:13,486
What was the last conversation
you had with the lieutenant?

2313
02:22:13,587 --> 02:22:17,182
Except for "hello" this morning,
the last time was last night.

2314
02:22:17,291 --> 02:22:20,954
- Did you discuss his trial last night?
- Yeah, some.

2315
02:22:21,061 --> 02:22:24,121
Would you tell the court what Lt. Manion
had to say about the trial?

2316
02:22:24,231 --> 02:22:27,723
Well, I said,
"Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2317
02:22:27,834 --> 02:22:30,735
And he said,
"I got it made, buster."

2318
02:22:30,837 --> 02:22:33,499
He said,
"I fooled my lawyer...

2319
02:22:33,607 --> 02:22:35,234
I fooled that head-shrinker...

2320
02:22:35,342 --> 02:22:37,902
and I'm gonna fool
that bunch of corn cobs on the jury."

2321
02:22:38,011 --> 02:22:41,674
Liar!
You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!

2322
02:22:43,116 --> 02:22:45,516
Take it easy, now.

2323
02:22:45,619 --> 02:22:48,486
I apologize for my client,
Your Honor.

2324
02:22:48,589 --> 02:22:52,286
Yet his outburst is almost excusable,
since the prosecution has seen fit...

2325
02:22:52,392 --> 02:22:55,987
to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the U. S. Army.

2326
02:22:56,096 --> 02:23:00,465
Your Honor, I don't know who's the
worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.

2327
02:23:00,567 --> 02:23:02,933
We're close to the end.

2328
02:23:03,036 --> 02:23:05,527
In the name of heaven,
let's have peace...

2329
02:23:05,639 --> 02:23:08,574
and courtesy
for these last few hours.

2330
02:23:08,675 --> 02:23:13,305
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2331
02:23:13,413 --> 02:23:16,746
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off
at every opportunity.

2332
02:23:16,850 --> 02:23:19,842
And the defendant will remain seated
in his chair and keep his mouth shut.

2333
02:23:19,953 --> 02:23:22,547
- Now go ahead.
- Mr. Miller...

2334
02:23:22,656 --> 02:23:25,352
are you certain
that Lt. Manion said...

2335
02:23:25,459 --> 02:23:27,654
"I've got it made, buster"?

2336
02:23:27,761 --> 02:23:30,525
- That's what he said.
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?

2337
02:23:30,631 --> 02:23:33,099
Yes, sir. He said when he got out...

2338
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,634
the first thing he was gonna do
was kick that bitch...

2339
02:23:35,736 --> 02:23:38,534
from here to kingdom come.

2340
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:41,437
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2341
02:23:42,542 --> 02:23:44,032
Your witness.

2342
02:23:45,045 --> 02:23:47,445
- What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.

2343
02:23:47,547 --> 02:23:49,538
I copped out,
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2344
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:51,641
How many other offenses
have you committed?

2345
02:23:51,752 --> 02:23:55,051
I was in reform school as a kid,
but that's all.

2346
02:23:55,155 --> 02:23:58,090
Your Honor, I'd like to see
this man's criminal record.

2347
02:23:58,191 --> 02:24:00,318
Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?

2348
02:24:00,427 --> 02:24:02,759
Yes, sir.

2349
02:24:02,863 --> 02:24:05,024
Here it is.

2350
02:24:07,334 --> 02:24:10,064
Your record shows you've been
in prison six times...

2351
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:12,695
in three different states...

2352
02:24:12,806 --> 02:24:16,264
three times for arson, twice for assault
with a deadly weapon...

2353
02:24:16,376 --> 02:24:18,276
once for larceny.

2354
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:23,315
Also shows you've done short stretches
in four city jails...

2355
02:24:23,417 --> 02:24:26,011
on charges of indecent exposure...

2356
02:24:26,119 --> 02:24:28,246
window-peeping, perjury...

2357
02:24:28,355 --> 02:24:31,256
and disorderly conduct.

2358
02:24:31,358 --> 02:24:34,156
Is this your true record?

2359
02:24:34,261 --> 02:24:36,024
Them things are never right.

2360
02:24:36,129 --> 02:24:38,427
How did you get the ear
of the prosecution...

2361
02:24:38,532 --> 02:24:41,831
in order to tell them about the
conversation you had with Lt. Manion?

2362
02:24:41,935 --> 02:24:44,927
-The D. A. was taking us into his office.
-Taking who into his office?

2363
02:24:45,038 --> 02:24:48,337
- Us prisoners in the jail.
- All at once, or one at a time?

2364
02:24:48,442 --> 02:24:51,309
One at a time.
Him and that other lawyer...

2365
02:24:51,411 --> 02:24:55,370
took us to his office and asked us
questions about Lt. Manion.

2366
02:24:55,482 --> 02:24:58,747
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand?

2367
02:24:58,852 --> 02:25:01,946
- Your Honor, the people object to...
- Overruled. Answer the question.

2368
02:25:02,055 --> 02:25:05,547
- I wasn't promised anything.
- You thought it'd help your troubles...

2369
02:25:05,659 --> 02:25:07,991
if you dreamed up this story
to please the D. A.

2370
02:25:08,095 --> 02:25:10,962
- I didn't dream up nothin'.
- You're sure that's what Manion said?

2371
02:25:11,064 --> 02:25:14,158
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- As sure as you were about your record?

2372
02:25:14,267 --> 02:25:16,827
Well, I guess I kind of goofed
on that one.

2373
02:25:19,339 --> 02:25:21,830
Your Honor,
I don't feel I can dignify...

2374
02:25:21,942 --> 02:25:24,502
this creature with any more questions.

2375
02:25:24,611 --> 02:25:27,045
Take the witness away.

2376
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:29,239
Would you like a conference
with your client?

2377
02:25:29,349 --> 02:25:32,477
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2378
02:25:32,586 --> 02:25:34,850
No, Your Honor.
We don't need a conference.

2379
02:25:34,955 --> 02:25:37,515
I'll recall Lt. Manion
to the stand right now.

2380
02:25:45,766 --> 02:25:48,894
Now, you've heard the testimony
of this Miller.

2381
02:25:50,137 --> 02:25:52,605
- Is any part of it true?
- None.

2382
02:25:53,874 --> 02:25:58,106
Lieutenant, do you have any idea why he
might come here with a tale like that?

2383
02:25:58,211 --> 02:26:00,111
No, sir.

2384
02:26:01,648 --> 02:26:03,946
Have you ever talked with this man?

2385
02:26:05,819 --> 02:26:07,616
What did you talk about?

2386
02:26:09,689 --> 02:26:11,850
Nothing important.

2387
02:26:11,958 --> 02:26:15,519
Certainly, nothing about
my personal life or my feelings.

2388
02:26:15,629 --> 02:26:17,688
That's all I wanted to know.

2389
02:26:17,798 --> 02:26:20,426
Lt. Manion...

2390
02:26:20,534 --> 02:26:23,560
have you ever had
any sort of...

2391
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:26,036
trouble with Miller?

2392
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:29,770
I don't know. What do you mean?
An argument? Something like that?

2393
02:26:29,876 --> 02:26:33,676
Did you ever attack...
physically attack him?

2394
02:26:35,015 --> 02:26:37,483
Your lawyer can't answer
the question for you, Lieutenant.

2395
02:26:37,584 --> 02:26:42,214
- Did you ever physically attack Miller?
- I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.

2396
02:26:42,322 --> 02:26:44,347
I pushed his head
against the bars one day.

2397
02:26:44,458 --> 02:26:47,552
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.

2398
02:26:47,661 --> 02:26:51,256
Do you remember pushing or bumping
his head against the bars?

2399
02:26:51,364 --> 02:26:53,491
Sure. I just told you.

2400
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:56,034
Then this was not
dissociative reaction.

2401
02:26:56,136 --> 02:26:58,661
The defendant isn't qualified
to answer that.

2402
02:26:58,772 --> 02:27:00,899
Lt. Manion...

2403
02:27:01,007 --> 02:27:03,339
wasn't your action against Barney Quill
much the same...

2404
02:27:03,443 --> 02:27:06,037
as your action against Miller
and against the lieutenant...

2405
02:27:06,146 --> 02:27:08,376
that you struck
at the cocktail party?

2406
02:27:08,482 --> 02:27:13,010
All in the heat of anger with a willful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2407
02:27:13,119 --> 02:27:15,349
I don't remember
my action against Quill.

2408
02:27:16,590 --> 02:27:20,026
How long had you known that your wife
was running around with Barney Quill?

2409
02:27:21,461 --> 02:27:24,328
I never knew anything like that.

2410
02:27:24,431 --> 02:27:26,023
I trust my wife.

2411
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:29,928
I suppose you just beat her up
occasionally for the fun of it.

2412
02:27:30,036 --> 02:27:33,301
Nothing has been established
to permit a question like that.

2413
02:27:33,406 --> 02:27:35,533
He keeps implying things
without getting to the point.

2414
02:27:35,642 --> 02:27:38,975
Let him ask the lieutenant,
did he ever beat his wife?

2415
02:27:39,079 --> 02:27:40,944
I'll sustain the objection.

2416
02:27:41,047 --> 02:27:43,572
Would you like to rephrase
your question, Mr. Dancer?

2417
02:27:45,285 --> 02:27:47,412
No thank you, Your Honor.

2418
02:27:47,521 --> 02:27:49,421
I've finished.

2419
02:27:49,523 --> 02:27:52,788
Then I'll ask him.
Did you, Lt. Manion...

2420
02:27:52,893 --> 02:27:56,021
ever beat your wife on the night
of the shooting or any other time?

2421
02:27:56,129 --> 02:27:58,063
- No, sir.
- Is there any doubt in your mind...

2422
02:27:58,164 --> 02:28:00,564
that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2423
02:28:00,667 --> 02:28:02,567
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2424
02:28:02,669 --> 02:28:05,069
Step down, Lieutenant.

2425
02:28:10,176 --> 02:28:12,736
- We hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2426
02:28:18,685 --> 02:28:22,451
Your Honor, I know time is pressing.
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2427
02:28:22,556 --> 02:28:24,490
I would like to leave
the courtroom for a moment.

2428
02:28:24,591 --> 02:28:27,151
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2429
02:28:27,260 --> 02:28:29,592
Thank you, sir.

2430
02:28:29,696 --> 02:28:32,164
This is highly irregular,
Your Honor.

2431
02:28:32,265 --> 02:28:35,063
There's no reason to make
a federal case out of it.

2432
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:50,116
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2433
02:28:50,216 --> 02:28:52,514
The defense calls Mary Pilant
to the stand.

2434
02:28:52,619 --> 02:28:54,712
We must protest this whole affair.

2435
02:28:54,821 --> 02:28:57,654
The noble defense attorney rushes out
to a secret conference...

2436
02:28:57,757 --> 02:29:00,726
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle.

2437
02:29:00,827 --> 02:29:03,853
The whole thing has obviously been
rigged to unduly excite the jury.

2438
02:29:03,964 --> 02:29:06,432
It's another cornball trick.

2439
02:29:06,533 --> 02:29:09,798
Your Honor, I don't blame Mr. Dancer
for feeling put-upon.

2440
02:29:09,903 --> 02:29:12,872
I'm just a humble country lawyer
trying to do the best I can...

2441
02:29:12,973 --> 02:29:16,374
against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2442
02:29:16,476 --> 02:29:18,842
Swear the witness.

2443
02:29:18,945 --> 02:29:22,745
Raise your right hand. Do you swear
the testimony you shall give...

2444
02:29:22,849 --> 02:29:26,649
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2445
02:29:26,753 --> 02:29:28,653
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2446
02:29:31,825 --> 02:29:34,817
- Where do you live, Miss Pilant?
- At Thunder Bay Inn in Thunder Bay.

2447
02:29:34,928 --> 02:29:38,193
- And how long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2448
02:29:38,298 --> 02:29:41,267
- And what's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2449
02:29:41,368 --> 02:29:45,998
Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundry
handled at Thunder Bay Inn?

2450
02:29:46,106 --> 02:29:48,040
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2451
02:29:48,141 --> 02:29:50,837
Where is the location of that chute
on the second floor?

2452
02:29:50,944 --> 02:29:54,471
- Between room 42 and 43.
- Who lives in those rooms?

2453
02:29:54,581 --> 02:29:58,244
I live in 42.
Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2454
02:29:58,351 --> 02:30:00,819
Would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2455
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:05,619
have to pass by the mouth of that chute
on the way to his room?

2456
02:30:05,725 --> 02:30:10,219
Would it be very easy for him to drop
something into that chute as he passed?

2457
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:14,198
Have you ever had occasion to go
down into the laundry at any time?

2458
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:17,599
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2459
02:30:17,704 --> 02:30:20,195
as they come out of
the wash-and-dry machine.

2460
02:30:20,306 --> 02:30:23,275
Would you tell the court what you found
among those pieces of laundry...

2461
02:30:23,376 --> 02:30:25,867
the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2462
02:30:25,979 --> 02:30:28,209
I found a pair of women's panties.

2463
02:30:28,314 --> 02:30:31,283
- And what did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2464
02:30:31,384 --> 02:30:34,717
When did you learn the significance
of those panties?

2465
02:30:34,821 --> 02:30:37,756
Here.
This morning, in the courtroom.

2466
02:30:37,857 --> 02:30:40,417
And then you went home
and got them out of the rag bin?

2467
02:30:40,527 --> 02:30:42,495
Did you bring them with you?

2468
02:30:45,699 --> 02:30:49,032
I offer this article of lingerie...

2469
02:30:49,135 --> 02:30:51,467
as Exhibit Number One
for the defense.

2470
02:30:51,571 --> 02:30:55,803
They're white,
they have lace up the side...

2471
02:30:55,909 --> 02:30:58,173
and they're badly torn...

2472
02:30:58,278 --> 02:31:02,009
as if they've been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2473
02:31:02,115 --> 02:31:04,049
The label reads...

2474
02:31:05,485 --> 02:31:08,079
"Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2475
02:31:08,188 --> 02:31:11,521
If there is no objection, the exhibit
will be received in evidence.

2476
02:31:11,624 --> 02:31:14,718
- That's all, Miss Pilant.
- Do you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick...

2477
02:31:14,828 --> 02:31:16,762
about the death of Barney Quill?

2478
02:31:16,863 --> 02:31:19,798
He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2479
02:31:19,899 --> 02:31:23,198
Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't
believe Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2480
02:31:23,303 --> 02:31:27,603
- Yes, I told him that.
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?

2481
02:31:27,707 --> 02:31:30,608
Was this also in connection
with the shooting of Quill?

2482
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:33,440
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2483
02:31:33,546 --> 02:31:35,776
- How many times did you talk to him?
- Twice.

2484
02:31:35,882 --> 02:31:38,077
- When was the last time?
- Last night.

2485
02:31:38,184 --> 02:31:40,482
And have you now changed your mind?
Do you now believe...

2486
02:31:40,587 --> 02:31:42,851
Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2487
02:31:42,956 --> 02:31:45,015
I don't know now.
I think he might have.

2488
02:31:45,125 --> 02:31:47,184
When did you change your mind?
Last night?

2489
02:31:47,293 --> 02:31:50,160
- No, it was here, this morning.
- When were you given the panties?

2490
02:31:50,263 --> 02:31:52,458
- Was that last night?
-Just wait a minute!

2491
02:31:52,565 --> 02:31:55,432
Use the proper form
of objection, Mr. Biegler.

2492
02:31:55,535 --> 02:31:59,528
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2493
02:31:59,639 --> 02:32:02,130
- The witness may answer.
- No.

2494
02:32:02,242 --> 02:32:05,075
I was not given the panties last night
or at any other time.

2495
02:32:05,178 --> 02:32:08,011
- I found them exactly as I said.
- Do you know for a fact...

2496
02:32:08,114 --> 02:32:10,981
that Barney Quill dropped the panties
down the chute, or did you assume it?

2497
02:32:11,084 --> 02:32:13,018
- I assumed it.
- Had you thought maybe someone else...

2498
02:32:13,119 --> 02:32:16,577
might have put the panties there
who wanted them found in the laundry?

2499
02:32:16,689 --> 02:32:18,589
I hadn't thought of that.

2500
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:22,525
And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call irresistible impulse...

2501
02:32:22,629 --> 02:32:25,257
you rushed in here with the panties
because you wanted to crucify...

2502
02:32:25,365 --> 02:32:27,265
the dead Barney Quill,
isn't that true?

2503
02:32:27,367 --> 02:32:30,336
- No, I thought it was my duty...
- Your pride was hurt, wasn't it?

2504
02:32:30,436 --> 02:32:33,371
- I don't know what you mean.
- He's trying to confuse the witness.

2505
02:32:33,473 --> 02:32:35,941
Let him ask her a question
she can understand.

2506
02:32:36,042 --> 02:32:40,035
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I myself would like
to know what you're driving at.

2507
02:32:40,146 --> 02:32:43,479
Miss Pilant,
when you found the panties...

2508
02:32:43,583 --> 02:32:46,814
was your first thought that Barney Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2509
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:50,822
or was it that he might have been
stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2510
02:32:50,924 --> 02:32:52,983
I don't know what he means.

2511
02:32:53,092 --> 02:32:57,654
Mr. Dancer, once again I must ask you to
put straight questions to the witness.

2512
02:32:57,764 --> 02:33:01,200
Here is a straight question,
Your Honor.

2513
02:33:01,301 --> 02:33:03,963
Miss Pilant, are you
Barney Quill's mistress?

2514
02:33:04,070 --> 02:33:05,970
No. No, I was not!

2515
02:33:06,072 --> 02:33:08,063
It's common knowledge in Thunder Bay
you were living with Quill.

2516
02:33:08,174 --> 02:33:12,543
- That's not true. Barney Quill was...
- Was what, Miss Pilant?

2517
02:33:16,916 --> 02:33:19,476
Barney Quill was my father.

2518
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:33,057
No more questions.

2519
02:33:33,166 --> 02:33:35,066
That's all for me.

2520
02:33:35,168 --> 02:33:38,069
The witness may step down.

2521
02:33:38,171 --> 02:33:40,765
We will recess for 15 minutes,
after which...

2522
02:33:40,874 --> 02:33:43,172
we will hear the closing arguments.

2523
02:33:43,276 --> 02:33:47,337
If possible, I would like to charge
the jury before nightfall.

2524
02:34:03,429 --> 02:34:05,863
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2525
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:23,340
Can't somebody say something?

2526
02:34:25,151 --> 02:34:27,642
What do you want me
to say, Maida, darling?

2527
02:34:27,754 --> 02:34:30,985
Tell me we're gonna win.

2528
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:35,026
I'm counting on getting that
promissory note from the lieutenant.

2529
02:34:35,128 --> 02:34:39,292
I hope I can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.

2530
02:34:39,399 --> 02:34:43,597
Half the time, the "p" and the "f"
don't strike on mine.

2531
02:34:43,703 --> 02:34:46,297
" Party of the first part"
sometimes comes out...

2532
02:34:46,406 --> 02:34:48,897
"arty of the irst art."

2533
02:34:49,008 --> 02:34:51,738
Doesn't make sense.
It's embarrassing.

2534
02:34:51,844 --> 02:34:54,210
"Arty of the irst art"?

2535
02:34:54,314 --> 02:34:56,441
I kind of like that.

2536
02:34:56,549 --> 02:34:58,676
Has a ring to it.

2537
02:35:01,587 --> 02:35:04,283
Twelve people go off
into a room.

2538
02:35:05,792 --> 02:35:09,728
Twelve different minds,
twelve different hearts...

2539
02:35:09,829 --> 02:35:13,196
and twelve different walks of life.

2540
02:35:13,299 --> 02:35:17,201
Twelve sets of eyes, ears,
shapes and sizes.

2541
02:35:17,303 --> 02:35:20,204
And these twelve people...

2542
02:35:20,306 --> 02:35:23,400
are asked to judge
another human being...

2543
02:35:23,509 --> 02:35:26,945
as different from them
as they are from each other.

2544
02:35:27,046 --> 02:35:30,607
And in their judgment,
they must become of one mind.

2545
02:35:30,717 --> 02:35:33,447
Unanimous.

2546
02:35:33,553 --> 02:35:37,455
That's one of the miracles of man's
disorganized soul that they can do it.

2547
02:35:38,992 --> 02:35:41,085
And most instances,
do it right well.

2548
02:35:43,062 --> 02:35:45,929
God bless juries.

2549
02:35:47,166 --> 02:35:49,828
I don't know what I'd do
if I were on that jury.

2550
02:35:53,473 --> 02:35:55,373
I really don't know.

2551
02:35:56,809 --> 02:35:58,037
Do you?

2552
02:36:02,882 --> 02:36:04,782
I loved that, Paulie.

2553
02:36:04,884 --> 02:36:08,786
I loved that
"humble country lawyer" bit.

2554
02:36:08,888 --> 02:36:12,016
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2555
02:36:12,125 --> 02:36:14,025
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.

2556
02:36:14,127 --> 02:36:16,459
That's the best summary I've ever heard
in a courtroom.

2557
02:36:16,562 --> 02:36:19,463
I liked yours much better, Paulie.

2558
02:36:24,404 --> 02:36:27,237
Do you have to play that stuff?
Can't you play " Danny Boy"...

2559
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:29,433
or "Sweet Isle of Innisfree"?

2560
02:36:43,523 --> 02:36:47,653
Paul Biegler's office.
Yes, sir. Right away.

2561
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:49,660
They're ready.

2562
02:36:59,338 --> 02:37:01,499
Hey, sweetie.

2563
02:37:02,675 --> 02:37:05,337
Go on.

2564
02:37:05,445 --> 02:37:07,538
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

2565
02:37:07,647 --> 02:37:10,616
You can tell my loving husband
I'll be waiting in the car.

2566
02:37:10,716 --> 02:37:13,810
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Oh, sure!

2567
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:17,481
He's lucky.
Some people have all the luck.

2568
02:37:17,590 --> 02:37:22,152
You can tell him I'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2569
02:37:22,261 --> 02:37:24,229
Oh! Hey, sweetie...

2570
02:37:24,330 --> 02:37:26,798
I have a souvenir for you.

2571
02:37:28,234 --> 02:37:30,225
You'd better keep that thing.

2572
02:37:30,336 --> 02:37:32,930
You might need it again sometime.
You never know.

2573
02:37:33,039 --> 02:37:35,166
No, you don't, do you?

2574
02:37:35,274 --> 02:37:37,504
Oh, I like you, Paulie.

2575
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:48,050
I warn all those present not
to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2576
02:37:48,154 --> 02:37:50,622
I will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

2577
02:37:50,723 --> 02:37:53,089
if there is any demonstration.

2578
02:38:02,034 --> 02:38:04,025
Proceed, Mr. Clerk.

2579
02:38:04,137 --> 02:38:06,697
Members of the jury,
have you agreed upon a verdict...

2580
02:38:06,806 --> 02:38:10,207
- and if so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.

2581
02:38:10,309 --> 02:38:12,209
The defendant will rise.

2582
02:38:15,047 --> 02:38:17,345
- What is your verdict?
- We find the defendant...

2583
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:19,884
not guilty by reason of insanity.

2584
02:38:25,558 --> 02:38:27,856
Maida gave you that promissory note,
didn't she?

2585
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:30,520
Right here, ready to be signed
by our happy client.

2586
02:38:32,031 --> 02:38:35,660
You know, I used to think the world
looked better through a glass of whisky.

2587
02:38:35,768 --> 02:38:38,032
It doesn't.

2588
02:38:38,137 --> 02:38:40,867
I think I'll keep it this way.
Looks nice.

2589
02:38:42,108 --> 02:38:45,305
Well, I got one good thing
out of this case...

2590
02:38:45,411 --> 02:38:49,370
a new law partner,
if it's all right with him.

2591
02:38:49,482 --> 02:38:52,940
He'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

2592
02:39:23,149 --> 02:39:26,414
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion,
aren't you, Mr. Biegler?

2593
02:39:26,519 --> 02:39:28,510
He gave me this note for you.

2594
02:39:30,089 --> 02:39:34,116
I felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.
She was crying.

2595
02:39:34,227 --> 02:39:37,890
Left a mess, didn't they?
Well, we'd better get busy here.

2596
02:39:37,997 --> 02:39:41,933
" Dear Mr. Biegler,
so sorry that I had to leave suddenly.

2597
02:39:42,034 --> 02:39:44,969
I was seized
by an irresistible impulse.

2598
02:39:45,071 --> 02:39:47,631
Frederick Manion."

2599
02:39:47,740 --> 02:39:50,368
How in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

2600
02:39:51,978 --> 02:39:55,971
Gin. I knew there was
something wrong with that guy.

2601
02:39:56,082 --> 02:39:58,414
Never saw a gin drinker yet
you could trust.

2602
02:39:59,919 --> 02:40:02,911
Partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

2603
02:40:03,022 --> 02:40:05,217
- Who might that be?
- Mary Pilant.

2604
02:40:05,324 --> 02:40:07,815
We're gonna administer
Barney Quill's estate.

2605
02:40:07,927 --> 02:40:11,363
Now, that's what I call
poetic justice for everybody.
