1
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,550
Your pal just drove into town,
Mr. McCarthy.

2
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,557
I'll have one more, Toybo.

3
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,718
I'm afraid I'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

4
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,395
- You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.
- Thank you, Toybo.

5
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,997
- Good night, Toybo.
- Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

6
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,034
<i>Operator.</i>

7
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,430
Operator, I want...

8
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,308
...489 Thunder Bay.
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

9
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,877
M-A-N-I-O-N.

10
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,757
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Iron City 700.

11
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,798
- Will they know when she'll be there?
<i>- No, they don't.</i>

12
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,270
I see. You just leave a message.
Tell her to call this number.

13
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,952
- What do you say there, Counsellor?
- Save your money.

14
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,838
- What's in the brown paper bag?
- It might be a cabbage head.

15
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,548
But it wouldn't be.

16
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,235
You're a very suspicious man.

17
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,354
True.

18
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,351
I'm everlastingly suspicious of...

19
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,074
...andlor fascinated by...

20
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,875
...the contents of brown paper bags.

21
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,872
- Can I sneak a peek?
- You do that, Counsellor.

22
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,394
You do that.

23
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,990
After you sneak a peek,
why, you uncork whatever you find.

24
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,389
Shall I pour?

25
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,909
- Your privilege.
- My pleasure, sir.

26
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,870
You fought this soldier by yourself.
You've been drinking alone, Pauly.

27
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,312
I don't like that.

28
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,552
Drop the stone, Counsellor.
You live in a glass house.

29
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,153
My windows were busted a long time ago,
so I can say as I please.

30
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,190
- Have an Italian cigar?
- No, thanks.

31
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,355
Those stinkweeds
are another sign of your decadence.

32
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,399
Pauly, it's a fact.

33
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,910
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out
of the office of public prosecutor...

34
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,994
...you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.
Not that I don't understand how you feel.

35
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,473
A man who gets beat out of an office
he's held for a long time...

36
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,431
...feels his community has deserted him.
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.

37
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,398
None but the lonely hearts
shall know my anguish.

38
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,278
Pauly, you are a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

39
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,391
Be here ready for clients, not fishing...

40
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,875
...and playing that rooty-tooty jazz.

41
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,916
I'm making a living.

42
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,955
I run a few abstracts and divorce Jane Doe
from John Doe every once in a while.

43
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,999
Threaten a few deadbeats.
And in the evening I sit around...

44
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,676
...and drink bourbon whiskey and read law
with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy.

45
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,435
One of the world's great men.

46
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,594
That was a kind word, Pauly.
You know, I might have been.

47
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,112
That's one of the reasons I hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

48
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,949
I look at you and see myself years ago,
with the same love for the smell...

49
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,635
...of the old brown books in a dusty office.

50
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,592
Here's a rose, a lily...

51
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,156
...a sweet lupine.

52
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,477
<i>The United States Supreme Court Reports.</i>

53
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,395
What shall we read this evening,
Counsellor?

54
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,638
How about a little Chief Justice Holmes?

55
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,557
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.
I might have a client. Waiting for a call.

56
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,557
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Biegler?</i>

57
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,195
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Hello, Mrs. Manion?

58
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,077
- What?
<i>- Mr. Biegler?</i>

59
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,509
I'm sorry I missed you.
Did you get my message?

60
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,874
Who? What is that name?

61
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,157
Just a minute, please.
We seem to have a bad connection.

62
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,872
It's a woman named Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

63
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,515
In Thunder Bay? If she wants you
to represent her husband, say yes.

64
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,269
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

65
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,588
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Biegler?</i>

66
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,513
This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

67
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,348
I waited for your call all afternoon.

68
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,795
<i>Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago.</i>

69
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,550
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

70
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,829
Yes.

71
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,550
<i>Mr. Biegler,</i>
<i>have you read about my husband?</i>

72
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,631
Yes, I have. A little.

73
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,433
<i>Will you defend him?</i>

74
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,875
I don't know.
I'd have to know more about it.

75
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,075
<i>Will you talk to him?</i>

76
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,078
He's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?

77
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,675
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.

78
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,554
I have?

79
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,837
<i>Yes, someone told him about you.</i>
<i>Will you see him?</i>

80
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,275
I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

81
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,632
- Would you want me there, too?
<i>- I think that would be fine.</i>

82
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,354
Let's make it about 10:00.

83
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,038
<i>- Thank you so much.</i>
- You're quite welcome.

84
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,558
What's this all about?

85
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,518
A man named Barney Quill
raped Mrs. Manion.

86
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,636
Her husband is a lieutenant in the Army.

87
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,553
There's a base in Thunder Bay,
gunnery or something.

88
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,310
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Quill about five times...

89
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,000
...which causes Quill
to die of lead poisoning.

90
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,877
- When?
- A couple of nights ago.

91
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,192
If you hadn't been out fishing in some
godforsaken place, you'd have known.

92
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,429
Good morning, Maida.

93
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,118
- There it is.
- What?

94
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,118
The newspaper.
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.

95
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,192
We haven't paid the bill.
Did you get my note?

96
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,835
We may be in the case.
I'm reading up on it now...

97
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,797
...before talking to Lt. Manion.

98
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,552
Doesn't he ever go home?

99
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,473
You mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.

100
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,039
Is that a fact?

101
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,596
I think maybe you'd better cancel
all my appointments for today.

102
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,508
What appointments?
People think you've migrated to the woods.

103
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,956
If this refrigerator gets more fish in it...

104
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,032
...it'll swim upstream
and spawn all by itself.

105
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,952
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

106
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,830
Yeah.

107
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,953
I went over your cheque-book yesterday.
I can't pay me my salary.

108
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,555
What happened to the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

109
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,558
Help salt a uranium mine or something?

110
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,996
I bought a few bare necessities.

111
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,113
Like a new outboard motor.
I wish I could be classed as a necessity.

112
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,394
- Aren't you going to have any toast?
- No.

113
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,431
I'll call you.
Let you know how things are going.

114
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,028
Now, don't let him pay you off
in Purple Hearts.

115
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,554
Those professional soldiers
never have a dime.

116
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,870
I ought to know, I was married to one.

117
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,157
Pardon me. Are you Mrs. Manion?

118
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,037
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

119
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,631
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

120
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,357
- This is Muff.
- Hello, Muff.

121
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,871
The jail's right here.

122
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,152
You're tall!

123
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,634
- Hello, Pauly.
- Hi, Sulo.

124
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,911
You wait here, Muffy.

125
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,352
- Good to see you.
- How're you feeling?

126
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,159
Fine. I guess you've come
for the soldier boy?

127
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,953
Yes. Do you think we could talk
in the sheriff's office?

128
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,838
Sure, I'll bring him down.

129
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,872
Would you mind taking your glasses off,
Mrs. Manion?

130
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,954
Gee-whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?

131
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,192
More than that. You should see. All over.

132
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,670
You can put them back on,
if it's more comfortable for you.

133
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,314
This is Pauly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Pauly.

134
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,719
- Lt. Manion?
- Hello, there.

135
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,638
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.

136
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,473
I wonder if you could meet me
down at my office about 2:00 p.m.

137
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,232
It's 305 West Barnham.

138
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,039
- Of course.
- Fine.

139
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,195
- Is there anything I can get you, hon?
- I'm all right, hon.

140
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,119
Right in here.

141
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,149
Wanted: The Big 10.

142
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,994
They got the 10 best-dressed dames,
the 10 top teams, the 10 top tunes...

143
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,432
...and now the 10 most-wanted.

144
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,670
Don't knock it. That's the American dream.

145
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,597
Those boys made the grade.

146
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,237
You were the district attorney around here,
weren't you?

147
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,117
Yes. Ten years.

148
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,274
What's your experience
as a defence lawyer?

149
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,515
Not very much.

150
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,234
How do I know you can handle my case?

151
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,710
I guess you don't know.
Shall we talk about it?

152
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,113
I suppose so.

153
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,236
Come on. Don't be so bored.

154
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,869
You know, it might very well be
that no lawyer can "handle" your case...

155
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,678
...if you mean getting off scot-free.

156
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,197
You seem to be forgetting:
Barney Quill raped my wife.

157
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,952
I have the unwritten law on my side.

158
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,635
The unwritten law is a myth.

159
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,553
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law.

160
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,638
Anyone who commits murder
on the theory it does exist...

161
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,757
...has bought himself room and board
in the state penitentiary.

162
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,432
Maybe for life.

163
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,994
With that in mind, perhaps we can proceed
with a few questions and answers that...

164
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,432
Can I borrow your lighter?

165
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,510
We can proceed with a few questions...

166
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,797
...that might be of some help
in your defence.

167
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,437
But probably won't be.

168
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,311
That's a nice lighter.

169
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,150
- How old are you?
- Twenty-eight.

170
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,198
- How long have you been in the service?
- Since '50.

171
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,070
- Have you seen any action?
- Korea.

172
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,958
- Do you have any decorations?
- Plenty.

173
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,032
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.

174
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,758
You're not on the witness stand.

175
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,833
You don't have to answer yes or no.
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

176
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,559
Is this necessary?

177
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,997
I'll be the judge of that.

178
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,637
My first wife divorced me.
Charged cruelty.

179
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,517
Eating crackers in bed,
you know, the usual stuff.

180
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,873
The truth was, she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

181
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,677
I met Laura four years ago, in Georgia.
We were married right after her divorce.

182
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,071
Did you know the husband?

183
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,113
He was in my outfit down there.

184
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,191
You mean you were buddies?

185
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,837
I'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.

186
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,708
Have there been any children
by or from any of these marriages?

187
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,553
- No.
- Any present prospects?

188
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,154
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

189
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,390
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?

190
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
War souvenir. Luger.
The police have it now.

191
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,192
I suppose you've read
the newspaper stories about your case?

192
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,389
Some of them.

193
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,074
- Are they substantially correct?
- Yes.

194
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,397
And you didn't see Quill
rape and beat your wife?

195
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,879
No. When she got back to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

196
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,278
How long was it
before you went to Quill's and killed him?

197
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,157
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

198
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,599
That long?

199
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,996
The newspapers say your wife volunteered
to take a lie-detector test.

200
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,433
Know anything about this?

201
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,312
Only what I read and what she told me.

202
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,834
Do you know
how the lie-detector test turned out?

203
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,150
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?

204
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,068
Pauly, we got lunch served for the jail.
Do you want to eat with us?

205
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,355
- Does your sister still cook for the jail?
- Sure, she cooks.

206
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,716
You give her my compliments, Sulo.
I've got a luncheon date downtown.

207
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,597
- Nice going...
- I'll be back after lunch.

208
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,873
I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.

209
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,952
No, you're not.

210
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,434
Come on, bucko.

211
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,431
Pass the salt, Pauly.

212
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,874
Thank you.

213
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,238
Did you give the lieutenant
the well-known lecture?

214
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,670
If you mean,
"Did I coach him into a phoney story?" No.

215
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,474
Maybe you're too pure, Paul. Too pure
for the natural impurities of the law.

216
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,959
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
a chance to find a defence.

217
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,676
You might guide him, show him the way
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

218
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,354
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.

219
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,638
I'm not the right lawyer for this fellow.
He's insolent, hostile.

220
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,278
You don't have to love him,
just defend him.

221
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,278
What's the matter, don't you need a fee?

222
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,191
You know something?
I think you might be a little bit afraid.

223
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,875
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

224
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,635
You know, there's only one thing
more devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

225
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,110
...and that's an Irish lawyer. Pass the salt.

226
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,549
Put it down!

227
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,070
- Hello, there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

228
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,711
Are we gonna have some more jokes?

229
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,030
Not unless you want to be the comic.

230
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,198
- I brought you some cigarettes.
- Thanks.

231
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,713
- Peace?
- Sure.

232
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,597
Fine. Now, Lieutenant...

233
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,953
...there are four ways I can defend murder.

234
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,910
Number 1: It wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

235
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,310
Number 2: You didn't do it.
Number 3: You were legally justified.

236
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,436
Like protecting your home or self-defence.

237
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,909
Number 4: The killing was excusable.

238
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,594
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?

239
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,753
I'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

240
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,549
Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

241
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,272
The time element.

242
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,239
If you'd caught him in the act, the shooting
might be justified. But you didn't.

243
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,153
You had time to get the police.
You didn't do that, either.

244
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,277
You're guilty of murder,
premeditated and with vengeance.

245
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,476
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

246
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,910
- So I should plead guilty?
- When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.

247
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,434
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

248
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,797
If you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me?

249
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,638
I'm not telling you to do anything.

250
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,070
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

251
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,795
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

252
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,669
Whatever it is you're getting at.

253
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,038
You're very bright.

254
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,349
Let's see how really bright you can be.

255
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,118
Well, I'm working at it.

256
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,352
Because your wife was raped, you'll have
a favourable atmosphere in the courtroom.

257
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,113
The sympathy will be with you
if all the facts are true.

258
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,792
What you need is a legal peg...

259
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,639
...so the jury can hang up
their sympathy in your behalf.

260
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,950
- You follow me?
- Yes.

261
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,595
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

262
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,917
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

263
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,952
Not justification, huh?

264
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,312
Not justification.

265
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,433
Excuse.

266
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,148
Just excuse, huh?

267
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,752
What excuses are there?

268
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,790
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

269
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,753
I must've been mad.

270
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,590
- How's that?
- I said I must've been mad.

271
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,031
A bad temper's no excuse.

272
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,158
I mean, I must've been crazy.

273
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,155
Am I getting warmer?

274
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,637
Okay, Sulo. I'm going...

275
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,073
Am I getting warmer?

276
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,313
I'll tell you that
after I've talked to your wife.

277
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,995
In the meantime, see if you can remember
just how crazy you were.

278
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,791
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?

279
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,991
She's been waiting quite a while.

280
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,277
She's been through all your albums
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

281
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,873
What do you think of her?

282
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,476
Soft, easy. The kind men
like to take advantage of, and do.

283
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,674
Did you get any money?

284
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,352
- Huh?
- Money.

285
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,509
I haven't decided to take the case yet.
You surprise me, sometimes.

286
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,475
Why? I've been around.

287
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,274
Yeah, well...

288
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,475
- Hi.
- Hi.

289
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,835
I hope you don't mind.
I think we'd better talk.

290
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,473
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.
The music, I mean.

291
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,229
Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?

292
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,471
Not that kind of music.

293
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,997
I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of a lawyer.

294
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,913
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?
Where'd you go to school?

295
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,513
Where did you grow up?

296
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,957
No place in particular. We moved around.
My father was a boomer.

297
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,431
Construction boomer.
Building dams mostly. Call me Laura.

298
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,678
- Is your family still alive, Laura?
- No.

299
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,435
I have some cigarettes
around here someplace.

300
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,915
- Want a cigarette?
- No, I wanted to offer you one.

301
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,195
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

302
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,229
Here.

303
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,352
That's just like your husband's, isn't it?

304
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,471
He gave me this because I liked the one
he had. He's like that.

305
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,039
He gives me presents all the time.

306
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,599
You have a happy marriage?

307
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,949
Yes.

308
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,234
What went wrong with the first marriage?

309
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,073
What went wrong
is when I went for Manny.

310
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,512
- That's honest enough.
- It was more than just that.

311
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,878
Like I told you, I grew up on the move,
and Jack, my first husband...

312
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,274
...didn't like to move.

313
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,590
He wouldn't even take a transfer.

314
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,117
I was really bored. Manny likes to go.
We're always going.

315
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,714
Whenever we get the chance.
We've been all over.

316
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,949
I'm thirsty.

317
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,118
Water? Or would a beer do?

318
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,031
I think a beer would do fine.

319
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,388
Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?

320
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,275
- Are you married?
- No.

321
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,639
That's nice.

322
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,518
What do you do alone in this house
if you aren't married?

323
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,989
It's a family home.
I'm the last of the family...

324
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,752
- There you are.
- Thank you.

325
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,591
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.

326
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,594
There you are.

327
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,277
Could Muff have a little?
In that ashtray, maybe? He loves beer.

328
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,273
You want a beer for the dog?

329
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,672
Well, here we are.

330
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,957
He'll go to sleep now.

331
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,752
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,234
Well, how about it? Are you ready?

333
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,198
I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?

334
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,277
I know what you mean.

335
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,717
Suppose you tell me
everything you told the state police...

336
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,230
...plus, everything you didn't tell
the state police.

337
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,153
Where shall I begin?

338
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,874
What time did you leave for Quill's bar?

339
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,918
Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.

340
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,794
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range. So, we had dinner.

341
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,478
He laid down and went to sleep.

342
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,678
I hadn't been out of the trailer all day,
so I took Muff and a flashlight...

343
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,239
...and walked over to the bar.

344
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,629
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

345
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,711
Many people in the bar?

346
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,756
Not many. Barney came over
and challenged me to a game. For drinks.

347
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,837
How well did you know Barney?

348
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,230
He owned this bar where Manny and I went
sometimes, that's all.

349
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,434
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No, nothing like that at all.

350
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,070
Was he drinking heavily that night?

351
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,197
He didn't seem to be.
At least, not when we were playing pinball.

352
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,834
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

353
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,871
No, there were other people playing.

354
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,349
What time did you leave the bar?

355
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,552
About 11:00, I guess.

356
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,718
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

357
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,279
He carries it in his mouth.

358
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,709
He's so cute,
running along with the light shining.

359
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,915
Was he sober?

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,276
Muff? Of course he was sober.
You're joking now, aren't you?

361
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,274
Yes, I'm joking. Go on.

362
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,595
Well, Barney came from somewhere,
not the door I left by.

363
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,917
He said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

364
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,549
He said the bears were prowling around
and I oughtn't to walk home.

365
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,035
The bears come out at night to scavenge.

366
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,951
They're harmless enough, aren't they?

367
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,077
I suppose I wouldn't have been afraid
in the daylight, but...

368
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,639
...the dark isn't the same.

369
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,320
Yes, I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car...

370
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,715
I got in and he drove to the trailer park.

371
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,632
He made overtures?

372
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,029
No, nothing.

373
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,953
When we got to the trailer park,
the auto-gate was closed.

374
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,470
Mr. Lemon closes it about 11:00,
or a little after.

375
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,233
I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

376
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,914
...but he said
there wasn't any need for me to walk.

377
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,793
That he could drive me into the park
on another road.

378
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,077
I didn't know there was another road,
but he drove on...

379
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,031
...before I could say yes or no.

380
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,272
- Were you alarmed?
- No, I'm not usually afraid of men.

381
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,670
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

382
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,957
Doesn't a woman sort of instinctively know
when a fellow's on the make?

383
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,558
Sure, but that's only usual with me,
with almost all men.

384
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,474
Ever since I was a kid.
You, for instance. You're interested.

385
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,799
But there isn't any reason to be afraid
of you. It was like that with Barney.

386
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,309
Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least...

387
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,992
Call me Laura.

388
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,310
Laura, I'm only interested in helping
your husband. Nothing more.

389
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,830
I don't mean you'd try anything.

390
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,117
I just mean, it's the way you look at me.

391
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,275
It would be very difficult
not to look at you.

392
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,994
The way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

393
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,799
I love it. I just love it.

394
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,758
We'd better keep moving along
with this thing.

395
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,638
How were you dressed that night?

396
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,429
In a sweater, like this, and a skirt.

397
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,870
And the rest? What about that?

398
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,675
Underneath? I had on a slip
and panties and a bra.

399
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,634
No girdle?

400
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,598
I don't need a girdle.
Do you think I need a girdle?

401
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,192
I don't know. How should...

402
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,551
I'm only concerned with the few facts
that might be of help to me...

403
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,756
...to defend your husband. That's all.

404
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,195
- Well, I don't wear one.
- Okay, no girdle.

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,958
All right. Now, go on.

406
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,312
He turned off the highway into a lane
in the woods, and he stopped the car...

407
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,158
...and turned off the lights.

408
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,751
And then he grabbed me and he said,
"I'm gonna rape you." Just like that.

409
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,829
He used those words?

410
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,311
Exactly those words. Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

411
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,915
I could hear little Muffy whining
outside the car, all through it.

412
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,716
Barney began to try to get at me
and I fought him off as best I could.

413
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,313
But he was terribly strong.

414
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,311
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

415
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,194
Didn't seem to be much use,
out there in the woods.

416
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,950
He began to shout names at me
like "army slut" and some other names.

417
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,594
Then, he drew back
and hit me with his fist.

418
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,478
He hit me again and I didn't fight anymore.

419
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,313
I must've been only half-conscious...

420
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,516
...but I know that he tore my panties off
and did what he wanted.

421
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,670
The newspapers said
a doctor examined you...

422
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,751
...and he didn't think you'd been raped.

423
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,389
I don't care what the doctor thought,
a woman doesn't mistake these things.

424
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,040
All right. Go ahead.

425
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,716
I don't know exactly what happened then,
I must've fainted.

426
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,836
The next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

427
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,311
Barney was driving very fast
and he was breathing hard.

428
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,195
An ugly, gasping sound.

429
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,669
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

430
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,399
...and he swung in by the gate
and stopped.

431
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,959
I opened the door to get out.

432
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,674
Muffy jumped out
with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.

433
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,875
Wait a minute.

434
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,117
You said he'd thrown Muff out of the car,
back in the woods.

435
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,513
He did, but he must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

436
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,678
All right. You opened the door
and Muff got out first.

437
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,431
Before I could get out, Barney grabbed me
and said he was gonna...

438
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,835
...tear all my clothes off
and attack me again.

439
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,109
I got away and ran.

440
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,276
I could see Muff at an opening in the fence.

441
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,432
He was scooting back and forth
with the flashlight.

442
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,428
Barney caught me from behind
and I fell to the ground.

443
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,273
He fell on top of me
and began to beat me with his fists.

444
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,078
I thought he was gonna kill me.

445
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,193
I screamed and somehow
I got to my feet again and ran.

446
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,312
I went through the opening in the fence,
followed Muffy...

447
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,630
...who was running ahead
with the flashlight.

448
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,393
I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

449
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,556
And you didn't see Barney again?

450
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,632
I never laid eyes on him again,
dead or alive.

451
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,718
I think that's enough for now.

452
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,115
I've got lots of time. All you want.

453
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,959
Where can I reach you?

454
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,709
I'm still in Thunder Bay,
but I can drive down again in the morning.

455
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,718
- Was there something else?
- No.

456
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,593
- Thanks for letting me play the records.
- You're very welcome.

457
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,677
- Who was that?
- The lady in the case.

458
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,837
You're not gonna take the case?

459
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,435
I don't know. That depends on
what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.

460
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,511
He's thinking things out.

461
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,152
That's more like it.

462
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,753
If I take the case, I'll want you in it.

463
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,429
Me? In a big murder case?

464
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,517
The sight of this whiskey-drinking old man
at the counsel table would ruin you.

465
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,999
I need you.

466
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,479
You mean that?

467
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,831
Why else would he say it?

468
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,998
I'll be glad to work with you outside
the courtroom, but not in the courtroom.

469
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,838
You suit yourself about that.

470
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,555
Either way, I'm gonna have to be able
to depend on you.

471
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,715
Will you lay off the booze?

472
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,756
I don't know about that.

473
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,638
Why don't you know?

474
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,878
Do you think I could lay off the booze?

475
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,357
Have you ever tried it?

476
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,874
Try it.

477
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,631
I've never been in a big murder case.
Not once in all my life.

478
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,632
Well, it's up to you, Parn.

479
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,398
Will you be around tonight?

480
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,155
Yeah, I'll be around.

481
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,595
Maida, darling, I might manage it.

482
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,120
I might manage to be a real lawyer again...

483
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,397
...for a little while, anyway.

484
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,559
I tried remembering.
There were still some pieces missing.

485
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,551
I remember...

486
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,309
...going to Quill's bar with a gun.

487
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,512
And I remember Quill's face
behind the bar...

488
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,916
...but I don't remember anything else.
Not even going home.

489
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,956
Don't you remember firing the gun?

490
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,110
Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.

491
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,988
I remember hearing shots,
but they don't seem connected with me.

492
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,511
They seemed far away, like somebody else
was doing the shooting.

493
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,477
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.

494
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,159
Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

495
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,430
There's the little matter of the fee.

496
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,353
$3,000. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

497
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,754
More than reasonable.

498
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,319
I'll pay you later. I'm broke.

499
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,954
- You're what?
- I'm flat busted.

500
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,235
I don't have $3, much less $3,000.

501
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,594
Can you raise it?

502
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,875
Yeah, as soon as I get out of jail.

503
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,076
Next week's payday,
I'll be able to give you $150.

504
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,197
If you get me off,
I'll give you a promissory note for the rest.

505
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,273
Suppose I don't go along with you
unless you pay me half the fee?

506
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,998
I'll have to take a lawyer
the court appoints. I got my defence now.

507
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,877
Right? Insanity?

508
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,919
I think I'll stick around
and make damn sure you get off.

509
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,595
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.

510
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,878
As neither one of us has money...

511
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,594
...do you think
the Army'll stir one up for you?

512
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,830
I know a colonel in the Pentagon. I'll write.

513
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,239
Good, do that. Sulo?

514
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,513
Where are you going now?

515
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,989
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

516
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,270
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

517
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,029
That's right, I did.
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

518
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,996
A man gets used to the way his wife looks.

519
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,918
Yeah, I guess he does. I'll see you.

520
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,797
Come on in, Pauly.

521
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,113
You haven't been in here
since you vacated.

522
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,953
Hardly recognise the old place?
Mary did it for me.

523
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,357
She just finished a decorator's course.
Smart girl.

524
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,035
- Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print.
- Very nice.

525
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,198
Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

526
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,350
Here, sit right down.

527
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,475
Great, isn't it?
"Good for the nerves," they say.

528
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,517
How do you shut it off?

529
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,955
Here we are. Feel better?

530
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,832
I feel all shook up.

531
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,675
I just dropped by to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

532
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,830
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

533
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,951
That's a mistake. It's open and shut.

534
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,513
Maybe. We'll see.

535
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,073
Judge Maitland's in the hospital.

536
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,873
Maybe you'd like a continuance
until he gets back.

537
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,712
If we go now, we'll have to try...

538
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,109
...before some grab-bag judge
they'll send in.

539
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,668
- I'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah, so would I.

540
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,548
But, of course, that also means my client
lies around in jail another two...

541
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,676
...or three months before the trial.

542
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,430
If you drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

543
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,313
...so he can get out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

544
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,755
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

545
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,637
I don't know, I might.

546
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,749
I might, since a big fat lie-detector test
on his wife has given proof...

547
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,308
...to the rape story.
The jury'll be with him.

548
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,391
How did you know what the lie...

549
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,552
- Bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

550
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,108
A lie-detector test
isn't admissible evidence.

551
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,315
You can't use it.

552
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,077
No, but it carries moral weight.
I wouldn't sit in that chair too much.

553
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,755
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.
I'll see you later.

554
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,797
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.

555
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,078
He likes the beer in my icebox.
What's the occasion today, a buffalo hunt?

556
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,277
No, I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

557
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,038
Aren't they smart?

558
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,872
We can sit in my car.

559
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,069
Here you are.

560
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,675
Several things have occurred to me.

561
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,150
The undergarments
that Barney Quill tore off:

562
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,470
Who has them now? The police?

563
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,437
You mean my panties?

564
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,517
All right, your panties.

565
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,073
I haven't seen them since.

566
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,913
I gave the torn skirt and sweater
to the police.

567
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,117
Then I went with them into the woods
to look for the panties...

568
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,475
...but we couldn't find anything
but my glasses.

569
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,834
Your glasses!

570
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,713
You mean,
you were wearing glasses through all that?

571
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,558
I had them in a case in my hand.

572
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,433
I wear them for reading,
playing pinball, things like that.

573
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,990
I must've tried to get out of the car
and dropped them.

574
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,753
You might be interested to know
that your lie-detector test turned out...

575
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,552
...in your favour.

576
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,074
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

577
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,798
You weren't worried about it?

578
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,871
No, why should I be?

579
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,557
Would you like to have something
to worry about?

580
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,834
Silly.

581
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,310
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

582
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,477
All right, let's have it.

583
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,913
Did he say something to you?

584
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,798
Just enough. Are you afraid of him?

585
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,314
Yes.

586
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,798
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie-detector test? For him?

587
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,909
Yeah.

588
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,314
Does he have reason to be jealous?

589
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,030
He was jealous
even before we were married.

590
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,549
I should've known how it would be.

591
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,439
It's funny, though.
He likes to show me off.

592
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,592
He likes me to dress the way I do,
and then he gets furious...

593
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,470
...if a man pays any attention to me.
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.

594
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,437
He begs, I give in.

595
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,235
Now, if you think
I've forgotten my question, I haven't.

596
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,399
I have.

597
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,870
Then I'll ask it again. Does your husband
have any reason to be jealous?

598
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,189
No. Not once.

599
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,113
Not ever.

600
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,674
Like the place all right?

601
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,275
I was just looking at those pictures.
That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?

602
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,432
- That's right. Barney Quill.
- I'm Paul Biegler...

603
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,717
I know who you are.
I've seen you around Iron City.

604
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,678
You didn't tell me your name.

605
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,069
Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

606
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,755
That's all right. I can wait.
I don't have the shakes yet.

607
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,948
You were on the job that night,
weren't you?

608
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,911
The night Barney Quill was killed.

609
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,230
Like the newspaper said, I was present.

610
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,676
You were the fellow
that stopped Lt. Manion outside.

611
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,829
That's right.

612
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,629
He pointed the gun at me and said,
"You want some too, buster?"

613
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,917
And you said no,
because your name isn't Buster.

614
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,558
Wasn't anything funny about it.

615
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,478
No, there wasn't anything... I'm sorry.

616
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,399
Where were you
when Barney Quill was killed?

617
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,519
I gather you don't want to talk
about that night?

618
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,750
That's right. I don't want to talk about it.

619
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,037
You'll have to talk to me about it in court,
why not now?

620
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,873
'Cause I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

621
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,949
Okay.

622
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,593
Old Barney, he was
kind of a rugged character, wasn't he?

623
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,269
Ex-prize fighter and muscleman,
and fancy with guns.

624
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,515
He paid his debts, ran a clean place.
Me, I liked him.

625
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,073
You run the place now?

626
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,152
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

627
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,716
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?

628
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,678
No. He didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

629
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,629
I wonder who's going to inherit the place.

630
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,792
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again, huh?

631
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,479
What's the matter with that?

632
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,314
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know.

633
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,594
Mary what?

634
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,559
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

635
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,352
She's in the back booth.

636
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,956
We don't talk about our customers here,
but if we did, which we don't...

637
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,189
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

638
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,797
Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?

639
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,350
Sure. I know the lieutenant, too.
He's a good officer.

640
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,758
She's all right, too. Friendly, a good kid.

641
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,869
- What do you know? Knock it off.
- I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.

642
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,188
What's wrong with that?

643
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,274
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?
What chances has the lieutenant got?

644
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,429
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

645
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,797
I'd like to help him out,
I sure would, but we're moving out.

646
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,916
The whole outfit. Berlin.

647
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,592
Tell me, who is this "babe" at the hotel?

648
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,113
Her name is Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

649
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,354
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

650
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,275
Will you be alone?

651
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,555
No, I'll be joined by two others.

652
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,957
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.

653
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,509
How was the manicure?

654
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,831
Ask me any questions about anybody.
I've got all the dope.

655
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,992
Can you tell me about a woman
by the name of Mary Pilant?

656
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,669
Easy. Mary Pilant may
or may not have been...

657
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,910
...the mistress of the late B. Quill.

658
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,560
The manicurist is in favour
of the mistress theory...

659
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,392
...but the hairdresser is against it.

660
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,156
However, they both agree that some kind
of hanky-panky must've been going on.

661
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,474
To be continued.

662
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,357
- Menu?
- Thank you.

663
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,757
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty. Well, go on.

664
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,350
There's one story that says that Barney's
wild night with Mrs. Manion was...

665
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,159
...somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.

666
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,875
Seemed she'd been seeing some soldier
and Barney blew his stack.

667
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,598
He got tanked up and exploded.

668
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,638
- Is Mary Pilant local?
- No, she's a Canadian.

669
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,756
Barney brought her in
to dress up the place...

670
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,594
...and she stayed on to manage it for him.
Looks like she's done all right.

671
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,353
It's better than all right.
She's in for the estate.

672
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,717
She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?

673
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,909
Where?

674
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,276
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.

675
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,191
This girl, right here?

676
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,833
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

677
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,349
I'm Paul Biegler, attorney for Lt. Manion.

678
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,318
This is Mrs. Rutledge and Mr. McCarthy,
my associates.

679
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,197
Could you sit with us for a minute?

680
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,475
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

681
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,670
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

682
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,309
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

683
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,392
Like, what kind of man your employer was?

684
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,754
A very nice man.

685
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,316
If that's true, how do you explain
what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?

686
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,474
I don't know what happened
with Lt. Manion's wife...

687
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,034
...so there isn't anything for me to explain.

688
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,078
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching.

689
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,913
Barney was well-liked here by everyone,
Mr. Biegler.

690
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,039
It's very generous to overlook his little
faults, like raping other men's wives.

691
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,232
If you will pardon me.

692
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,914
The waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

693
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,238
Nice to have met you,
Mr. Biegler, Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

694
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,909
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.

695
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,114
Manion?

696
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,432
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah, this. From Washington.

697
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,957
They'll let a doctor come to testify,
but there's a string on it.

698
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,675
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

699
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,070
Doesn't the Army understand
you're in jail on a non-bailable offence?

700
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,355
That's it, as far as the Army's concerned.

701
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,910
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try to think of something.

702
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,831
My wife hasn't been here for two days.

703
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,150
- Have you seen her?
- No. Not for a while.

704
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,516
- Where the hell is she?
- You've got other things to worry about.

705
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,319
I'll get in touch with her
and tell her you miss her.

706
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,595
Yeah, you tell her that.

707
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,755
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Pauly.

708
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,869
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

709
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,152
I'd be tearing my hair out, too,
if I had something like that outside.

710
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,150
Something like what outside?

711
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,234
You know what I mean. Something
like that running around on the loose.

712
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,109
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?

713
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,833
It's me, dummy.
I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.

714
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,840
You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?

715
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,434
No, but a little bourbon might help.

716
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,520
Knock it off, buckos!

717
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,955
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

718
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,919
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got!
Hi, Pauly.

719
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,393
That's what they call you, isn't it? Pauly?
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.

720
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,394
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- You're not splitting the scene, man?

721
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,478
- I mean, you're not cutting out?
- No, I'll be back.

722
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,753
Hi, Pauly. Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.

723
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,670
- Sit down, won't you?
- Sorry, I can't right now.

724
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,917
Mrs. Manion, may I talk to you
for a moment outside?

725
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,430
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped
the formalities a long time ago.

726
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,239
We'd better pick them up again.
This is important.

727
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,709
- All right, I'll go with you.
- All right, come on.

728
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,191
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure, what do you think?

729
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,992
- See you later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.

730
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,398
Did you get my phone message?

731
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,999
Yeah, but I got busy.

732
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,911
Why haven't you been to see
your husband?

733
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,877
I don't see why I have to go every day.

734
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,235
It would be a very good idea if you did.

735
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,436
All right. I'll see him every day.

736
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,675
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay.

737
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,591
- Where's your car?
- I came with them.

738
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,752
- Mine's right over here.
- Now wait, I got friends inside.

739
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,558
Friends or not, you're going home.

740
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,675
Who do you think you are?

741
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,553
I'm the lawyer trying to save your husband.
Remember?

742
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,438
- What's that got to do with...
- You listen to me!

743
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,597
Until this is over, you're going to be
a meek little housewife...

744
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,312
...with horn-rimmed spectacles.

745
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,394
You're going to stay away from men,
juke joints, booze and pinball machines.

746
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,040
You're gonna wear a skirt
and low-heeled shoes.

747
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,634
And you're gonna wear a girdle.
Especially a girdle.

748
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,315
Believe me. I don't usually complain
of an attractive jiggle...

749
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,517
...but you save that jiggle
for your husband to look at...

750
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,275
...if and when I get him out of jail.
Now, come on. Let's go.

751
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,838
I'm sorry. I really am.

752
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,229
I wouldn't hurt Manny's chances
for anything.

753
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,514
Come on.

754
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,955
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

755
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,718
Yeah. Right over here.

756
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,354
Over there's the opening in the fence
where Muffy...

757
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,238
...was running back and forth
with the flashlight.

758
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,197
Where's your trailer?

759
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,392
Up there on the hill.

760
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,997
This is my favourite place.

761
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,475
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
I'd come out here and just sit.

762
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,119
I had to get out of that trailer.

763
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,998
I couldn't stand
being cooped up all the time.

764
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,878
I'm lonely, Paul. I'm awful lonely.

765
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,150
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that.

766
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,830
Maybe you're getting in
some good practise for being lonely.

767
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,516
You think maybe Manny won't get off?

768
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,592
That'll be up to the jury
and you never can tell about them.

769
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,069
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

770
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,312
No, I don't mean that.

771
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,430
I may think it sometimes,
but I don't really want it.

772
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,558
Hello, sweetie. Did you miss me?
Of course you missed me.

773
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,508
You want to come in, Paul?
You can if you want to, you know.

774
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,317
No, thank you, Laura.

775
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,037
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun
over at that place.

776
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,554
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.

777
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,876
Hear ye, hear ye.

778
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,158
The Circuit Court for the County
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

779
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,433
You can be seated.

780
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,350
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

781
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,394
I'm from downstate
and I'm sitting temporarily...

782
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,473
...while your good Judge Maitland
is recovering from a severe illness.

783
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,872
There's no need, I think,
to dwell at length upon my methods.

784
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,474
One judge is quite like another.

785
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,189
The only differences may be
in the state of their digestions...

786
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,477
...or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

787
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,279
For myself, I can digest pig iron...

788
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,837
...and while I might appear
to doze occasionally, you'll find...

789
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,717
...that I'm easily awakened...

790
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,190
...particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer...

791
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,311
...with a nice point of law.

792
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,999
We will now take up the criminal docket.

793
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,595
Case Number 1:
The People versus Clarence Madigan.

794
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,509
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.

795
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,753
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

796
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,757
That's me, Your Honour.

797
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,793
"State of Michigan, Court of Iron Cliffs.
I, Mitch Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...

798
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,878
"... come into said county
and give the court to understand...

799
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,034
"... that Clarence Madigan, alias 'One-Shot
Madigan,' alias 'Smoky Madigan'...

800
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,236
"... did enter the dwelling of Casper Katz...

801
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,955
"... and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises."

802
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,949
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

803
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,669
No. A man's got to have money
to ask them fellows the time of day.

804
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,549
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,
it's my duty to appoint an attorney...

805
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,914
...on your behalf.

806
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,869
I wouldn't bother, Your Honour.
I stole the whiskey. I'm guilty as hell.

807
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,595
It was a full case of expensive bourbon.

808
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,073
Did you sell this whiskey?

809
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,713
No. I drank it.

810
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,518
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

811
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,149
Are you aware that it will be necessary
to punish you for this crime?

812
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,633
It was worth it.

813
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,713
I'll accept your plea of guilty.
You'll be sentenced later.

814
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,957
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honour.

815
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,552
Case Number 2:

816
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,353
The People versus Frederick Manion.
The charge: Murder.

817
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,231
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

818
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,994
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?

819
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,399
None of them.

820
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,358
Mr. Sheriff, will you produce the prisoner?

821
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,434
I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Honour.

822
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,398
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

823
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,554
The defendant is in Detroit
being examined by a psychiatrist.

824
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,636
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

825
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,678
...before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

826
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,354
We're dealing with the Army in this matter.

827
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,552
They only gave us one crack
at one of their psychiatrists.

828
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,710
The court was not present
and it was urgent...

829
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,195
...to get the defendant to the psychiatrist.

830
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,595
What does the attorney for the People say?

831
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,716
It was done with my knowledge,
Your Honour.

832
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,553
I've always heard this Upper Peninsula
of our fair state...

833
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,232
...was a queer place.

834
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,869
If it's customary here to allow a man
charged with first-degree murder...

835
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,748
...to wander about at will,
I don't suppose it behoves an outsider...

836
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,391
...to point out that the law makes
no provision for such quaint liberalism.

837
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:08,157
The defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon.

838
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,437
We'll formally arraign the defendant
on his return.

839
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,157
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue as to his plea?

840
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,551
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

841
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,756
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

842
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,708
The case of Frederick Manion
will be placed first on the trial docket.

843
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,795
Can you hurry it up?

844
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,316
If the judge hears the prisoner
was lounging at the railroad station...

845
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,839
...he'll really give it to me.

846
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,514
It'll just take a minute. Come over here.

847
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,276
Lieutenant, how did things turn out?

848
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,393
I was temporarily insane.

849
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,072
- Did he tell you that?
- Yeah.

850
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,191
He said he'd write you a letter,
but I took notes on my own.

851
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,436
- The doctor's name was Smith.
- Smith?

852
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,593
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

853
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,831
- Name like that would impress the jury.
- Just plain Matthew Smith.

854
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,831
He said when I shot Quill...

855
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,514
...I was suffering from
"dissociative reaction."

856
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,150
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?

857
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,919
What does it mean in English?

858
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,198
It means I had an "irresistible impulse"
to shoot Quill.

859
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,439
That's okay, isn't it?

860
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,517
Did he say you knew the difference...

861
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,955
...between right and wrong
when you shot Quill?

862
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,277
I don't think he said anything about that.
Is that important?

863
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,952
We'd better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You'd better go.

864
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,992
You ever heard of a Michigan court
accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?

865
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,958
No. Maybe we'd better switch
to self-defence.

866
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,597
Even Mitch Lodwick
would make a monkey out of us on that.

867
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,079
Damn strawberry soda.

868
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,549
- Here, do you want a peanut?
- No, thanks.

869
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,037
Tomorrow is Saturday.

870
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,795
We just have the weekend before the trial.

871
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,472
When do we start working?

872
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,835
Tomorrow morning. Early.

873
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,315
- Pauly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

874
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,511
Never mind that. Just find:

875
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,708
"People versus Durfee,
62, Michigan, 486, year 1886."

876
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,832
That's it. I have it right here in the <i>A.L.R.</i>
Listen.

877
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,873
"The right and wrong test,
though deemed unscientific...

878
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,236
"... is adhered to by most of the states,
but..." Listen to this.

879
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,153
"But, the fact that one accused
of committing a crime...

880
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,754
"... may have been able
to comprehend the nature...

881
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,831
"... and the consequences of this act...

882
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,151
"... and to know that it was wrong,
nevertheless..."

883
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,874
Dear, sweet, endearing word,
"nevertheless."

884
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,716
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution by an impulse...

885
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,198
"... by an impulse,
which he was powerless to control...

886
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,550
"... he will be excused from punishment."

887
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,310
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.

888
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,038
This is precedent.

889
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,190
I think we got a hold of something here.

890
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,478
Good old Durfee, 1886. How about that?
Give me a pad.

891
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,429
By the saints, this strawberry soda pop
is beginning to taste like whiskey.

892
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,796
Don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...

893
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,872
...that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

894
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,188
Remember that.

895
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,595
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

896
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,509
Before we proceed, it will be necessary
for me to examine you...

897
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,751
...on your qualifications to sit as jurors.

898
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,835
Please remember that you are under oath.

899
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,717
Are all of you citizens?

900
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,959
Will you please raise your hand
if you are not?

901
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,796
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

902
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,195
No.

903
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,831
Are any of you related by blood
or marriage to a law enforcement officer?

904
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,508
No.

905
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,315
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.

906
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:16,196
Does anyone have business pending with
the prosecuting attorney, Mitch Lodwick?

907
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,474
No.

908
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,635
Does anyone have business pending
with Paul Biegler, attorney for the defence?

909
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,069
No.

910
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,436
Is anyone acquainted with the defendant...

911
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,795
...seated there on Mr. Biegler's left?

912
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,151
Will the defendant's wife please stand?

913
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,232
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

914
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,993
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

915
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,230
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

916
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,195
Before counsel's challenge, may I introduce
Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?

917
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,632
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general
from Lansing.

918
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,320
Because of the peculiar nature
of this case...

919
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,154
...I asked the attorney general
for Mr. Dancer to sit with the prosecution.

920
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,630
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

921
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,793
- It's a privilege to have you in my court.
- I'm sure it'll be instructive.

922
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,716
Do any of you have any business pending
before the attorney general's office?

923
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,433
No.

924
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,078
I must apologise
for my disparaging remarks...

925
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,628
...about the Upper Peninsula
and its customs.

926
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,595
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected
and sworn in less than half a day.

927
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,918
You've won my heart completely.

928
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,231
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

929
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,960
There was a little suggestion
I wanted to make.

930
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,354
By all means.

931
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,956
Since the defence plea is insanity,
the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.

932
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,551
By statute, we have the right to request
a mental examination by our own doctor.

933
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,949
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?

934
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,989
Moderately.

935
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,753
It would only delay things
to file a formal petition...

936
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,952
...so why don't we informally agree...

937
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,719
...to ask for an adjournment?
Only a day or so...

938
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,549
...and our doctor can see the defendant.
It would save a great deal of time.

939
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,477
- Yes, I'm sure it will.
- Good.

940
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,752
But, suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway?

941
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,955
You're a little late,
but maybe His Honour will overlook that.

942
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,950
I'd sort of like the jury to see that
you think our insanity plea has some merit.

943
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,548
There's no need for our doctor
to examine your client.

944
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,911
- I was only following the usual procedure.
- I'm all for it.

945
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,072
Do you wish to file the petition?

946
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,438
- Yes...
- It won't be necessary.

947
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,119
It won't be necessary.

948
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,875
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?

949
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,149
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

950
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,518
One of the bullets
had passed through the heart.

951
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,797
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

952
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,030
...and was directly caused by this wound.

953
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,953
Dr. Raschid,
may I have your detailed report?

954
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,234
Certainly.

955
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,915
I ask that this report be marked
"People's Exhibit 1" for identification.

956
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,752
So received and marked.

957
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,197
The People hand the defence
a copy of the report.

958
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,316
Counsel may cross-examine.

959
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,030
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was
to ascertain the cause of death, was it not?

960
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,235
Yes.

961
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,117
Yet I read in your report...

962
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,869
...you checked to determine
if spermatogenesis was occurring...

963
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,116
...in the body at the time of death.

964
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,519
Objection, Your Honour!

965
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,558
The People call this witness
only to show the cause of death.

966
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,433
Your Honour,
the entire report was offered as evidence...

967
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,273
...and it contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

968
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,198
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.

969
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,753
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

970
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,309
Would you tell the court your findings?

971
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,634
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

972
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:44,157
In other words, the deceased,
in life, was not sterile.

973
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,471
- He could produce children.
- Correct.

974
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,712
If a woman says she has had intercourse
with a certain man...

975
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,434
...who is proven fertile, though no evidence
is found in the woman's body...

976
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,795
...could a lawyer, a prosecuting attorney...

977
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,111
...could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

978
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,349
Your Honour...

979
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,517
...I object to this line of questioning.

980
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,157
We are not concerned here with relations
between a man and a woman.

981
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,357
As long as an examination
for spermatogenesis had been made...

982
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,391
...at least we're entitled to know why.

983
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,993
Overruled. You may answer.

984
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,954
Yes, prosecution could use that...

985
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,311
...though it certainly would not be
conclusive that she was lying.

986
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,635
Why not?

987
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,951
There could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative.

988
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,794
The use of a contraceptive...

989
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,629
...or possibly, there was no completion
on the part of the man.

990
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,428
In this post-mortem,
were you asked to determine...

991
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,034
...if the deceased
had reached sexual climax...

992
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,236
...shortly before death?
- No, sir.

993
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,954
- Could you have determined it?
- Yes.

994
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,473
So, you were only asked
to make such examinations...

995
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,592
...that might be useful to the prosecution,
but not the defence?

996
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,079
I object, Your Honour.

997
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,192
The question is argumentative.

998
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,558
The defence is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the People.

999
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,712
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1000
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,268
I withdraw the question and apologise.

1001
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,630
The question and answer will be stricken...

1002
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,236
...and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1003
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,275
That's all.

1004
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,439
No redirect.
The People now call Lloyd Burke.

1005
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,509
Will the witness step forward, please?

1006
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,276
How can a jury disregard
what it has already heard?

1007
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,036
They can't, Lieutenant.

1008
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,954
They can't.

1009
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,389
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1010
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,469
I do.

1011
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,430
Will you state your profession, please?

1012
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,152
I'm a commercial photographer.

1013
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,715
Were you called upon by the police...

1014
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,429
...to take photographs of the body
of the deceased, Bernard Quill...

1015
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,432
...before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1016
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,555
Yes, sir.

1017
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,438
Were these photographs of the deceased
made by you?

1018
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,239
They were.

1019
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,317
The recorder will mark these photographs:

1020
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,233
"People's Exhibit 2A to 2D"
for identification.

1021
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,631
Photographs are tendered to the defence
for examination...

1022
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,513
...and we move their admission
as evidence. Your witness.

1023
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,313
No questions, no objections.

1024
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,234
- He took pictures of me that night, too.
- Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1025
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,153
Mr. Burke, these photographs
offered as evidence:

1026
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,879
Are they the only photographs
you took that night?

1027
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,994
No.

1028
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,031
The others didn't turn out?

1029
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,711
All my pictures turn out.

1030
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,912
Of course. I beg your pardon.

1031
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,310
Did you give the other pictures
to the police?

1032
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,708
Yes, sir, I did.

1033
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,989
What were they?

1034
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,709
Were they side shots
or a shot of the moon, perhaps?

1035
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,394
Or a black bear scavenging
in the Thunder Bay dump?

1036
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,359
I object. I can't see how other photographs
are relevant.

1037
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,556
The photographs
were introduced to show...

1038
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,995
...that the deceased
met with a violent death.

1039
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,516
Your Honour, any photograph
pertaining to the case would be relevant.

1040
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,189
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

1041
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,073
What were these other photographs of,
Mr. Burke?

1042
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,518
Lt. Manion's wife.

1043
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,275
These photographs showed how she looked
after Barney Quill was killed?

1044
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,318
- Yes.
- Your Honour, how she looked is irrelevant.

1045
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,870
No evidence has been introduced
to connect her appearance to the murder.

1046
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,394
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honour.

1047
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,597
I wanted to be sure the prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1048
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,908
Now, look here!

1049
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,032
I protest to the defence attorney's
persistent attacks...

1050
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,355
...on the motives of the prosecution.

1051
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,871
The jury will disregard the remark made
by the attorney for the defence.

1052
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,313
There is no reason to believe
the prosecution hasn't acted in good faith.

1053
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,358
My apologies to the prosecution
and the court.

1054
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,793
But, Your Honour...

1055
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,192
...as long as protests are being made,
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1056
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:54,349
I'm perfectly willing to take on
these two legal giants any time, any place.

1057
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,069
But, in all fairness,
it ought to be one at a time.

1058
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,675
I don't want these two pitching
knuckle balls at me at the same time.

1059
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,953
It seems to me
you're batting close to 1000...

1060
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,389
...but your point is well-taken.

1061
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,949
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

1062
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,512
...he, alone, shall continue
with that witness until they are excused.

1063
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,790
Thank you, Your Honour.
No more questions.

1064
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,359
No questions.

1065
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,433
We're doing well, aren't we?

1066
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,592
- Where is Parnell?
- Why? Isn't he here?

1067
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,792
No, nor in his rooming house.
He hasn't been there all night.

1068
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,518
You saw him last. Where is he?

1069
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,750
I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.

1070
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,876
He hasn't fallen off the wagon?

1071
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,149
No. He was sober.

1072
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,468
Has he gone somewhere?

1073
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,755
He did borrow my car for something.

1074
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,558
Your car? That was smart.

1075
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,076
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.
He'll kill himself. Where's he gone?

1076
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,918
My word is my bond.

1077
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,591
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1078
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,869
You may proceed.

1079
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,113
Your Honour...

1080
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,195
...the defence notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1081
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,272
We were wondering if the court
shares our curiosity about him?

1082
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,918
I was about to introduce him.

1083
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,789
Your Honour, this gentleman
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1084
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,677
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist
in this case.

1085
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,438
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

1086
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,276
What will he observe? The constellation
of Taurus or the life of a bumblebee?

1087
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,437
He'll observe the defendant.

1088
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,879
That's fine.

1089
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,632
The defence has no objection.

1090
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,280
I just wish to express my relief...

1091
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,319
...that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1092
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,870
We call Alphonse Paquette.

1093
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,638
Raise your right hand, please.

1094
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,314
You do solemnly swear
that the testimony you give...

1095
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,029
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1096
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,832
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.

1097
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,232
Will you state your name, please?

1098
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,833
Alphonse Paquette.

1099
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,674
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn, right?
- I'm bartender there.

1100
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,151
Were you working the night
Mr. Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1101
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,390
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1102
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,635
I was.

1103
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,598
Will you tell us in your own words, please,
what happened?

1104
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,871
I was at a table by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1105
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,996
Did you know Lt. Manion
by sight and name?

1106
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,553
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

1107
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,315
He came in and walked over to the bar
and began to shoot.

1108
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,635
He shot Barney
when he came up to the bar.

1109
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,349
When Barney fell, he kept on shooting
down at Barney behind the bar.

1110
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,118
Then he turned and walked out.

1111
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,398
When Lt. Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1112
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,437
Well, he walked slow.

1113
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,076
Kind of deliberate.

1114
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,037
Did he speak to Barney Quill?

1115
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,235
Not a word.

1116
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,558
He just walked over
and pulled out his gun and "bang."

1117
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,270
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.

1118
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,799
When he walked out,
how did he appear to you?

1119
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,555
He seemed just like he did
when he walked in.

1120
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,796
Like he was the mailman delivering mail.

1121
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,078
When Lt. Manion walked out of the bar,
what did you do?

1122
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,317
It happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned...

1123
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,200
...but then I ran after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1124
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,954
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1125
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,073
I said, "Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1126
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,952
Did he reply to you?

1127
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,358
He said, "Do you want some, too, buster?"

1128
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,871
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1129
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,669
He was holding the gun in my direction,
but the muzzle was low.

1130
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,748
When he said,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"...

1131
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,313
...how was that expressed?

1132
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:08,349
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?
Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?

1133
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,073
No, sir. He just said it cool and hard,
and looked right at me.

1134
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,318
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1135
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,193
...to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

1136
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,830
Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.

1137
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,198
- Your witness.
- Did you see Laura Manion...

1138
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,470
...Lt. Manion's wife, in the bar that night?

1139
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,552
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1140
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,428
I don't see what the prosecution's
jumpy about. I haven't gone any place yet.

1141
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,996
Let's see where he's going
before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.

1142
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,071
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1143
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,914
Did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1144
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,516
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night?

1145
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,151
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1146
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,992
Around midnight.

1147
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,112
From which entrance did he come?

1148
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,193
Did he come from the lobby entrance
or from that outside entrance?

1149
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,912
It was from the lobby.

1150
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,273
- How did he appear to you at that time?
- How do you mean?

1151
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,631
You understood the prosecution...

1152
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,314
...when he asked
about Lt. Manion's appearance.

1153
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,473
He was just old Barney, like usual.

1154
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,833
You mean,
he was just good old, sober, reliable...

1155
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,794
...gentle, salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney?

1156
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,395
- What kind of a question is that?
- I withdraw the question.

1157
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,872
Mr. Paquette...

1158
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,789
...had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1159
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,989
I don't remember.

1160
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,759
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned?

1161
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,434
That is,
might he have changed his clothes?

1162
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,393
I couldn't say. I didn't notice.

1163
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,398
Was Barney drinking that night?

1164
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,919
He always had a few shots
while talking to the customers.

1165
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,151
- He was friendly.
- Sure he was, good old Barney.

1166
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,829
How many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1167
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,115
I don't know exactly.

1168
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,112
Wasn't he, in fact,
pretty loaded that night?

1169
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,474
Objection.

1170
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,996
Even if the deceased was dead drunk,
it's no defence to this charge.

1171
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,272
Sustained. I suggest you get off this.

1172
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,034
Mr. Paquette.

1173
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,715
What would you call a man
with an insatiable penchant for women?

1174
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,589
A what?

1175
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,237
A penchant: A desire, a taste, passion.

1176
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,112
A ladies' man, I guess.

1177
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,350
Or maybe just a damned fool.

1178
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,553
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.

1179
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,314
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

1180
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,195
What else would you call a man like that?

1181
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,350
We can't see the drift of this.

1182
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,396
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.

1183
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,589
You may answer.

1184
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,951
Can you think of another name?

1185
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,671
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.

1186
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,199
- Masher?
- Come now, Mr. Paquette.

1187
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,636
Mashers went out
with whalebone corsets and hairnets.

1188
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,197
- Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?
- Sure, I've heard that.

1189
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,636
- It just slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind. Naturally, it would.

1190
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,234
Clanking around in there
with those rusty old mashers.

1191
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,630
Have you ever known a man
who you could call a wolf?

1192
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,559
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?

1193
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,948
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't.

1194
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,917
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1195
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,719
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.

1196
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,279
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned...

1197
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,516
...from wherever he had gone...

1198
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,477
...did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1199
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,758
- What did he say?
- He said, "I'll take over."

1200
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,155
Coming out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1201
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,919
I went over to the Pedersons' table.

1202
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,756
You testified that you were by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1203
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,798
You were by the door
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1204
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,148
Yes.

1205
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,879
How long was it
before Lt. Manion came in?

1206
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,077
I don't know exactly. Maybe 30 minutes.

1207
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,549
And you remained with the Pedersons
all that time?

1208
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,993
Yes. They're my friends.

1209
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,674
Is there also a window beside that table?

1210
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,752
- I think so.
- You think so.

1211
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,957
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn?

1212
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,388
Six or seven years.

1213
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,632
Does this window beside the table
suddenly vanish...

1214
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,514
...and then reappear,
and come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1215
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,828
It's there all the time.

1216
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,595
While you were talking to your friends,
did you look out the window?

1217
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,157
- I might have.
- When you looked out...

1218
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,755
...were you looking for something?
- No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1219
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,158
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go
to the window and watch out for Manion?

1220
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,000
Did he tell you to look out for Lt. Manion?

1221
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,873
He did not.

1222
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,429
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?
With guns.

1223
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,511
He'd won prizes for shooting, hadn't he?

1224
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,197
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

1225
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,519
He might have.

1226
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,434
Isn't it a fact that there are three
concealed pistol racks behind the bar?

1227
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,156
The defendant's plea is one of insanity,
not self-defence.

1228
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:57,835
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten that,
Mr. Lodwick.

1229
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,308
You may answer.

1230
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,073
Are there concealed gun racks
behind the bar?

1231
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,552
- Yes.
- How many people know of the gun racks?

1232
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,109
I couldn't say.

1233
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,749
Isn't it a fact that Barney
would sometimes take the guns out...

1234
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:15,470
...twirling them on his fingers,
to demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

1235
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,749
- I don't remember.
- Try and remember.

1236
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,956
Did you ever see him do that yourself?

1237
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,755
Once or twice.

1238
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,672
That's all, Mr. Paquette.

1239
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,193
No further questions.

1240
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,679
The witness may step down.

1241
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,910
Call George Lemon.

1242
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,550
Biegler's going off in all directions.

1243
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,519
What's he getting at?

1244
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,677
I have a feeling he's afraid
of what we'll get at.

1245
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,954
Mr. Biegler's putting up a smoke screen
for some reason.

1246
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,069
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.

1247
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,273
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1248
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,711
What kind of work do you do?

1249
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,719
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1250
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,631
I see the place is clean and orderly.

1251
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,194
I check people in and out,
lock the gate at night.

1252
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,354
What is your authority for these duties?

1253
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,115
I'm paid by Mastodon township
and I'm also a deputy sheriff...

1254
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,593
...just courtesy, sort of.

1255
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,913
Did you see Lt. Manion
on the night of the 15th...

1256
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,834
...the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1257
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,671
Will you tell the court...

1258
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,390
...about how and when
you saw Lt. Manion?

1259
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,513
About 1:00 a.m.,
a knock on my door waked me up.

1260
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,068
I went to the door
and Lt. Manion was standing there.

1261
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,233
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1262
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,992
I told him to go to his trailer
and that I would call the police.

1263
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,835
How did Lt. Manion appear to you
when he asked you to take him?

1264
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,396
He said what he had to and did what I said.
There wasn't any fuss.

1265
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,557
Did he appear to be,
as far as you could tell...

1266
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,996
...in complete possession of his faculties?

1267
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,152
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.

1268
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,233
Take the witness.

1269
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,076
Mr. Lemon,
did you go to the Manions' trailer?

1270
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,229
Yes, sir.

1271
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,880
- Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,598
What was her appearance?

1273
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,913
She was a mess.

1274
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,629
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...

1275
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,115
...to make Mrs. Manion's
appearance relevant.

1276
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,795
No evidence was introduced to make
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1277
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,552
...but you didn't object to that.

1278
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,309
Is that because you know
that Barney Quill bathed and changed...

1279
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,834
...after he raped and beat
this poor woman?

1280
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,913
Everybody in this court is being tried
except Frederick Manion. I protest...

1281
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,953
This is a cross-examination
in a murder case, not a high-school debate!

1282
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,510
What are you trying to do,
railroad this soldier into the clink?

1283
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,239
Mr. Biegler,
you are an experienced attorney...

1284
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,954
...and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1285
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,032
I will not tolerate
intemperance of this sort.

1286
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,032
If you once again try the patience
of this court...

1287
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,076
...I shall hold you in contempt.

1288
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,709
Sorry.

1289
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,869
Your Honour...

1290
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,233
...I apologise.

1291
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,035
It won't happen again.

1292
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,552
The witness' answer will be stricken
and the jury will disregard the answer.

1293
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,475
Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1294
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,794
Yes, sir.

1295
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,079
Mr. Lemon.

1296
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,070
On the night when Lt. Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1297
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,593
...had you been awakened before?

1298
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,353
- Had anything else disturbed your slumber?
- No, sir.

1299
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,318
There were no soldiers singing?

1300
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,755
No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.

1301
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,917
There were no women screaming?

1302
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,997
Those screams were down by the gate.

1303
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,394
Objection!

1304
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,120
I see no reason for objecting yet.

1305
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:39,109
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.

1306
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,392
I didn't hear them myself.

1307
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,314
Some tourists from Ohio in the park
heard them and told me the next day.

1308
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,429
Mr. Lodwick?

1309
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,353
This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...

1310
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,273
...irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...

1311
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,191
That's too much for me.

1312
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,358
The witness is yours.

1313
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,073
No questions.

1314
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,192
The witness may step down.

1315
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,959
Call your next witness.

1316
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,191
Detective Sgt. James Durgo.

1317
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,838
- Hi, Pauly.
- Hi, Jim.

1318
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,072
As soon as we break,
you'd better phone that Army psychiatrist.

1319
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,435
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1320
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,157
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1321
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,514
Won't do.

1322
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,313
You're fired!

1323
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,834
You can't fire me till you pay me.

1324
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,998
Were you called to Thunder Bay
by Deputy Sheriff Lemon...

1325
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,958
...on the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir, I was.

1326
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,911
My companion officer and I
were first on the case.

1327
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,596
Sgt. Durgo, when you arrived
at the Manion trailer, who was there?

1328
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,597
Lt. Manion and his wife.

1329
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,310
What did Lt. Manion say to you?

1330
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,192
He said his wife had had some trouble
with Barney Quill...

1331
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,034
...and that he'd gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1332
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,312
He asked whether Quill was dead or not,
we told him he was.

1333
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,875
How did Lt. Manion take this information?

1334
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,919
He didn't seem surprised.

1335
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,712
What did you do then?

1336
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,718
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1337
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,794
Did you take Lt. Manion
to the jail here in Iron City that night?

1338
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,719
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant down
with his wife.

1339
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,588
On the drive to Iron City,
did the lieutenant talk about the shooting?

1340
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,276
He said that if he could do
the whole thing again, he'd still do it.

1341
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,996
During all this,
at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...

1342
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,633
...how did Lt. Manion appear?

1343
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,036
He was very quiet most of the time.

1344
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,355
Seemed clear-headed.

1345
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,029
Would you say he was
in complete possession of his faculties?

1346
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,999
He seemed so to me.

1347
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,155
Your witness.

1348
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,712
You testified that Lt. Manion
told you that he shot Barney Quill...

1349
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,634
...after he had learned that his wife
had had some trouble with Quill.

1350
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,436
Were these the words
Lt. Manion used: "some trouble"?

1351
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,677
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

1352
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,468
Was it your notion to use your own words?

1353
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,318
No, sir, it was not.

1354
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,630
Was the suggestion
to call it "some trouble"...

1355
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,188
...made by somebody in this courtroom?

1356
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,548
Yes, sir, it was.

1357
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:13,271
Would you tell the court
what words Lt. Manion actually used...

1358
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,316
...to describe the trouble his wife had?

1359
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,119
Objection. We've been over this before.

1360
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,152
This would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1361
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:26,268
The statement "some trouble" came out
during the examination of Sgt. Durgo.

1362
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,715
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted
all testimony concerning Laura Manion.

1363
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,270
The cat's out of the bag,
it's fair game for me to chase it.

1364
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,552
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1365
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,313
I'd like to hear the prosecution.

1366
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,472
The burden is on the defence...

1367
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,313
...to prove temporary insanity
at the time of the shooting.

1368
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,194
If the reason for the alleged insanity
is important to this case...

1369
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,709
...then it's a matter
for a competent witness.

1370
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,394
An expert on the subject
of the human mind.

1371
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,868
What the defence is trying to do...

1372
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,599
...is introduce some sensational material...

1373
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,513
...for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues.

1374
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:09,156
Your Honour, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here...

1375
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,471
...unless they first know the reason
behind this whole trial:

1376
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,393
Why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?

1377
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,109
Now, the prosecution would like
to separate the motive from the act.

1378
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,113
That's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1379
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,910
The core of our defence is that
the defendant's temporary insanity...

1380
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,237
...was triggered by this
so-called trouble with Quill.

1381
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,276
I beg the court...

1382
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,711
I beg the court to let me cut into the apple.

1383
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,955
Our objection still stands, Your Honour.

1384
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,633
Objection overruled.

1385
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,517
Tell the court how Lt. Manion
described the trouble...

1386
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,437
...his wife had with Barney Quill.

1387
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,478
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.

1388
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,839
Can you recall what Lt. Manion
told you about the rape?

1389
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,469
Yes, sir.

1390
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,239
He said he'd been asleep
since right after dinner.

1391
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,309
He was waked up by some noise,
screams, he thought.

1392
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:32,349
He got up,
opened the trailer door and went outside.

1393
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,552
His wife came running out of the dark
and fell into his arms.

1394
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,679
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?

1395
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,752
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1396
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,593
She had big, black bruises
over her face and arms.

1397
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,513
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

1398
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,635
She did.

1399
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,671
Did she take you to where it happened?

1400
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,909
Yes, the next morning.

1401
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,314
Did you find anything?

1402
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,995
Any evidence pertaining to the story
that Mrs. Manion had told you?

1403
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,992
On the lane in the woods,
we found tyre tracks and dog tracks...

1404
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:06,115
...and a leather case
with some horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1405
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,318
We also looked for a certain undergarment
of Mrs. Manion's, but we didn't find it.

1406
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,315
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench, please?

1407
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,908
Mr. Biegler, you finally got
your rape into the case...

1408
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,795
...and I think all the details
should now be made clear to the jury.

1409
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,438
Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?

1410
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,955
Absolutely.

1411
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,950
What exactly was the undergarment
just referred to?

1412
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,553
Panties, Your Honour.

1413
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,756
Do you expect this subject
to come up again?

1414
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,159
Yes, sir.

1415
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:43,273
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1416
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,431
Can we find another name for them?

1417
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,988
I've never heard my wife
call them anything else.

1418
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,197
I'm a bachelor, Your Honour.

1419
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,953
That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

1420
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:58,511
When I was overseas during the war,
Your Honour, I learned a French word.

1421
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,109
I'm afraid it might be slightly suggestive.

1422
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,918
Most French words are.

1423
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,514
All right, gentlemen, back to your places.

1424
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,958
For the benefit of the jury,
but more especially for the spectators...

1425
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:14,949
...the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1426
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,912
...Mrs. Manion's panties.

1427
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,389
I wanted you to get
your snickering over and done with.

1428
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,513
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial.

1429
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:33,152
When it happens, there will not be
one laugh, one snicker, one giggle...

1430
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,919
...or even one smirk in my courtroom.

1431
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,789
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1432
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:43,236
...which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1433
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,517
...and the possible incarceration of another.

1434
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,679
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1435
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,149
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie-detector test?

1436
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,437
Objection. A polygraph test
is inadmissible evidence in our courts.

1437
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,592
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1438
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,319
He may answer that.

1439
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,638
I gave her a lie-detector test
at her request.

1440
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,236
Now, after all this investigation,
did you believe Mrs. Manion?

1441
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,309
I did.

1442
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,472
- Even after the lie-detector test?
- I object to that question.

1443
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,394
It constitutes flagrant subterfuge
on the part of the defence counsel.

1444
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,232
Objection sustained.

1445
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:20,355
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
a polygraph or lie-detector test...

1446
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,115
...is not admissible in evidence,
because no one has ever been sure...

1447
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,789
...that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1448
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,308
Go ahead.

1449
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:33,679
In any case, Sgt. Durgo, you, yourself,
in your own heart and mind...

1450
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,035
...are quite convinced
of Mrs. Manion's honesty.

1451
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,071
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1452
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,598
Just a moment.

1453
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,957
Did you look for the panties
elsewhere than the lane in the woods?

1454
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,191
We looked in Barney Quill's car
and his room in the hotel.

1455
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,633
We didn't find the panties.

1456
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,678
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie-detector test?

1457
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,951
- I know what she said.
- What was that?

1458
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:03,828
She wanted everybody to believe her story
as she knew it would help her husband.

1459
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,558
Was that the only reason she gave?

1460
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,588
Said she'd already sworn to her husband
and she wanted everybody to believe it.

1461
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,796
One moment please, Your Honour.

1462
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,236
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1463
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,877
Did Mrs. Manion say
how she had sworn to her husband?

1464
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,793
Yes, sir.
She said she had sworn on a rosary.

1465
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:29,193
Sergeant, this lane in the woods:
What's it used for? Where does it go?

1466
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,711
It used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go any place, just stops.

1467
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,119
Who uses it now?

1468
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,796
I think it's a road kids drive down to park.

1469
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,394
- It's a lovers' lane?
- I think so, yes.

1470
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,948
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.

1471
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,479
The witness may step down.

1472
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,872
In view of the evidence concerning rape,
which Your Honour has ruled admissible...

1473
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,679
...we ask for a 30-minute recess
in order that we may...

1474
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,228
...bring in a witness
we had not anticipated using.

1475
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,715
All right, we'll take a 30-minute recess.

1476
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,199
Recess.

1477
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,434
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

1478
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,953
We forgot it.

1479
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,758
We didn't forget it. Manny said,
maybe we shouldn't tell that again.

1480
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:18,313
It might've looked like something else.
Like I didn't believe her.

1481
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,871
How much more didn't you tell me?

1482
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,077
Everything else.
We told you everything else.

1483
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,838
Is that right, Laura?

1484
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,797
Yes, everything else.

1485
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,110
All right, now get this, both of you:

1486
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,835
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

1487
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,355
I don't want you to tell anything
but the truth.

1488
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,956
Don't try and lie or conceal anything,
or you'll get skinned alive.

1489
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,715
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1490
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,276
Doctor Dompierre, did you have occasion
to come to the county jail...

1491
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,316
...the night of August 15 of this year?

1492
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,389
I did.

1493
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,398
- Who called you to the jail?
- The police authorities.

1494
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,436
What did they want you to do?

1495
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,472
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1496
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,630
...on the person
of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1497
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,755
I made the test.

1498
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,513
In making this test,
what was your conclusion?

1499
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,352
Negative. There was none.

1500
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,351
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1501
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,997
In making these tests,
did you notice any bruises or marks...

1502
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,718
...on Mrs. Manion at that time?

1503
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,789
I did.

1504
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,348
Were you asked about
the reason for these bruises?

1505
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,668
I was not.

1506
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,558
Where did you do the lab work
on your test for sperm?

1507
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,557
St. Margaret's Hospital in this city.

1508
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,669
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.

1509
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,313
Wouldn't it have been better to have
these slides worked up by a pathologist...

1510
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,072
...or an expert in this field?

1511
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,594
Yes, but the police were in a hurry.

1512
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,240
I knew this fellow came on at 7:00 a.m.

1513
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,033
Wouldn't it have been better
to wait for the expert...

1514
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,714
...if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1515
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,869
It would've been.

1516
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,953
In the newspaper,
on the evening of August 16...

1517
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,952
...it was stated you found
no evidence of rape. Is that true?

1518
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,470
It is not true. I made no such statement.

1519
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,473
Did you form an opinion as to
whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1520
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,312
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1521
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,753
It's impossible to tell if a mature,
married woman has been raped.

1522
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,148
That's all.

1523
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:30,597
Did you have an opinion about whether
she'd had any recent relations with a man?

1524
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,719
Insofar as no sperm was present...

1525
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,110
...it didn't appear that she had had
recent relations with a man.

1526
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,713
Just one more question:

1527
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,360
The fact that no evidence was present
in her body...

1528
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,670
...does not mean that she was not raped,
does it?

1529
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,749
No.

1530
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,229
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1531
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,830
Yes, sir. Violation is sufficient for rape.

1532
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,074
- There need not be a completion.
- No further questions.

1533
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,559
The witness may step down.

1534
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,438
The People recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand.

1535
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:02,514
Your Honour, since counsel for the defence
has forced the question of rape...

1536
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,717
...it's necessary to take
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1537
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,036
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1538
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,677
Will you look at Mrs. Manion,
seated behind the defence table?

1539
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,394
Was she dressed like this
on the night of the shooting?

1540
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,993
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1541
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:23,830
She had on a real tight skirt
and sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.

1542
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,510
She was wearing
red shoes with high heels.

1543
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,158
Was she wearing hose?

1544
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,954
No, she was bare-legged.

1545
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,911
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1546
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,513
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion have
under that hat?

1547
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,518
We'd be very happy to show the court
Mrs. Manion's hair.

1548
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,831
Mrs. Manion,
would you take off your hat, please?

1549
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,912
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1550
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,197
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing glasses
that night?

1551
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,630
I think she was when she played pinball.

1552
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:59,713
Considering the tight skirt
and the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1553
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,118
...what was the result in her appearance?

1554
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:07,358
Would you say Mrs. Manion's appearance
was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1555
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,756
You could pretty much see
everything she had.

1556
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,276
The defence will concede that Mrs. Manion,
when dressed informally...

1557
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,351
...is an astonishingly beautiful woman.

1558
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,956
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please.

1559
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:23,354
As a matter of fact, it's pretty easy
to understand why her husband...

1560
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,116
...became temporarily deranged, seeing
such beauty bruised and torn by a beast.

1561
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,229
I protest.

1562
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,311
Mr. Biegler is the least disciplined...

1563
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:35,830
...and the most completely out-of-order
attorney I've ever seen.

1564
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,793
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

1565
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,113
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily
that night?

1566
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,875
I sold her six drinks myself,
and then Barney got some more for her.

1567
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,279
I don't remember how many.

1568
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,078
Would you say that she was tight?

1569
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,189
She was high all right.

1570
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,475
What did she do
to make you think she was high?

1571
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,994
She took off her shoes
and went barefooted.

1572
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:59,792
When she played pinball...

1573
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,394
...she'd swish around
to give the machine inkling.

1574
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,149
You mean,
she was flipping her hips around?

1575
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,958
Anything else?

1576
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:13,155
When she made a good score, she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do.

1577
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,397
She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?

1578
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,636
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

1579
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,188
Friendly, I guess.

1580
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,833
More than friendly?

1581
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,116
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?

1582
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,678
She'd kind of lean on him...

1583
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,110
...and a couple of times
she bumped him with her hip.

1584
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,111
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1585
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:39,639
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness.

1586
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,759
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was free and easy with Barney Quill?

1587
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,795
I would.

1588
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:45,915
Your witness.

1589
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,268
The attorney for the People asked you
if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...

1590
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,595
...and you said she was "high."

1591
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,517
Speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1592
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,636
I don't think I understand.

1593
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,115
When we say a person is tight,
we usually mean they're a little...

1594
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,196
...stupid with drink, isn't that so?

1595
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,793
I guess that's about it, yes.

1596
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,713
If they're high,
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1597
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:11,829
Yes.

1598
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,269
In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

1599
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:17,477
Is there anything wrong with being happy
in Thunder Bay Inn?

1600
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:23,073
Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?
Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?

1601
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:27,713
Is there anything unusual about seeing
a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1602
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,838
So, Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off
in Thunder Bay...

1603
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,037
...doesn't necessarily mean
she was being unladylike, does it?

1604
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,473
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1605
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,549
No.

1606
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:44,309
You testified that Mrs. Manion
was squealing and jumping up and down...

1607
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,315
...and "swishing her hips"
around the pinball machine.

1608
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,990
Was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1609
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:58,596
Were all the men at the bar
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

1610
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,790
But you were very conscious
of Mrs. Manion.

1611
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,678
You were so conscious
that you can tell us all this.

1612
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,072
Barney Quill was conscious of Mrs. Manion
because he was playing pinball with her.

1613
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,394
Wouldn't you say so?

1614
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,150
So, it seems only you and Barney Quill
were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion...

1615
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,071
...her actions and her appearance.

1616
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,237
Maybe when good old Barney
came to get some drinks from you...

1617
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,319
...maybe he winked and said,
"I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."

1618
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,435
No, he didn't.

1619
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,313
Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss."

1620
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,550
Objection!
Counsel is attacking the witness.

1621
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,312
No more questions.

1622
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:35,789
The court's had about all of this dogfight
it can take for one day.

1623
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,117
I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1624
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,158
Tomorrow, the defence takes over.

1625
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,158
With expedition, prayer,
and a little self-discipline...

1626
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:48,199
...on the part of the counsel, perhaps
we can reach an end by Saturday night.

1627
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,157
Will you adjourn court?

1628
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,876
This court stands adjourned
until 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

1629
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,313
He's banged up a little, but nothing else.

1630
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,834
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

1631
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,797
How much damage did he do?

1632
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,874
He wrecked a gate and a barn door
and he hasn't got a driver's license.

1633
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:54,429
He'll have to appear in the J.P. Court
when he's able, the old fool.

1634
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,911
Speak kindly of the dead.

1635
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,112
- Can I have a minute with the corpse?
- Sure, Pauly.

1636
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,796
Was it worth trying to kill yourself
for whatever it is you've been up to?

1637
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,998
How's the trial going?

1638
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,959
I'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.

1639
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,712
Where've you been?

1640
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,990
Quill hired Mary Pilant
up north of Sault Sainte Marie.

1641
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:26,559
It struck me funny he'd go up there
to hire somebody just to work for him.

1642
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,870
I've been up there nosing around.

1643
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,991
Did you find anything useful?

1644
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,878
Not until I looked up her birth certificate.

1645
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:38,950
Born: Blind River, Ontario, 1934,
out of wedlock.

1646
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,836
Mother was a waitress. Simone Platt.

1647
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:47,712
Father was a lumberjack
named Barney Quill.

1648
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,475
I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.

1649
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,669
It's late, mister.

1650
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,671
I know. This is important.

1651
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,830
- Real important?
- Real important.

1652
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,638
Miss Pilant? Sorry if I woke you.
There's a guy to see you.

1653
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,994
Says it's important.

1654
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,399
- What's your...
- Biegler.

1655
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,468
<i>I don't wish to see him.</i>

1656
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,388
She said it's not important enough.

1657
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:23,870
You call her back and tell her
I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.

1658
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,758
I'll be in the bar.

1659
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,355
Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?

1660
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,159
I'll try a little of both.

1661
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,913
What do you say we start out with a beer?

1662
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,234
On the house.

1663
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,949
That's all you get: A beer.
No questions, no answers.

1664
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,390
I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.

1665
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,436
What are you so afraid of, Al?

1666
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,152
Sit over there, please.

1667
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,515
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.

1668
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,114
I was a little rough
when I was out here before.

1669
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,630
I didn't know Barney Quill was your father.

1670
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,631
You didn't come here just to apologise.

1671
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,231
No, but the apology was part of it.

1672
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:30,592
To tell the truth, I sort of hoped
maybe it would thaw you out a bit.

1673
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,748
All I want you to do is listen to me,
just for a few minutes.

1674
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:39,678
I need some strong evidence to back up
Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1675
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,150
The prosecution's gonna attack
that story pretty hard.

1676
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:48,311
If the jury thinks she's lying,
it could turn the decision against Manion.

1677
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:53,151
Isn't she lying? Barney didn't do
what she said he did. He couldn't have.

1678
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,672
What did you know about your father?

1679
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,709
All I needed to know. He took care of me
and my mother for as long as she lived.

1680
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:04,278
He was always there when I needed him.

1681
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:09,116
That's what I know about my father.
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

1682
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:12,112
I don't want to get at you.
I don't want to hurt you.

1683
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,435
I appreciate your affection for your father.

1684
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:20,151
But, as a lawyer, I've had to learn
that people aren't just good or just bad.

1685
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,231
People are many things.

1686
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,477
I kind of have a feeling
that Barney Quill was many things.

1687
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,754
I don't wanna hear it.

1688
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,836
Please, hear me out.
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette...

1689
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,592
...what happened that night.

1690
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,752
He told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1691
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,832
Barney stayed behind the bar,
next to a gun rack.

1692
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:39,989
Just waiting.

1693
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,870
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1694
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:46,315
...and the first shot
went through Barney's heart.

1695
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,675
Here's what I want you to do.

1696
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:53,117
I want you to try and persuade Al
to come to court as a defence witness...

1697
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,953
...and tell them exactly
what Barney told him that night:

1698
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,958
That he'd raped
and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

1699
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:03,479
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?

1700
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,471
I don't know.

1701
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:10,076
But I know this:
Everybody loves something or someone.

1702
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:14,308
Me, I love fishing
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1703
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,756
Manion loves his freedom,
he'd like to have a little more of it.

1704
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,991
Barney loved you, maybe so does Al.

1705
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,752
I wouldn't blame him.

1706
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,515
But he doesn't want to hurt you.
He doesn't want you to know the truth:

1707
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:31,679
That Barney could be dangerous and brutal.
If you just ask Al...

1708
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,716
If you just ask him straight out...

1709
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,355
Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1710
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:52,035
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed.

1711
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,951
Something you won't tell.

1712
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:58,034
Lawyer, I told you once, I'll tell you again:
No questions, no answers.

1713
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,439
Wait, Al.

1714
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,752
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1715
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,275
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1716
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:12,593
Is there any reason
you wouldn't tell me the truth about that?

1717
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,519
What reason?

1718
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:21,989
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

1719
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,119
I'm gonna leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1720
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:29,596
You might like to watch
Lt. Manion get convicted.

1721
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,916
You gonna talk about
Mary being Barney's kid?

1722
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:35,669
No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.
Thank you for the beer.

1723
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,399
- Good night.
- 'Night.

1724
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,911
All right, now let's get at this rosary thing.

1725
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,232
It's been testified
that your wife swore to you on a rosary...

1726
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,515
...that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

1727
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,797
Now, did you ask your wife
to swear on a rosary?

1728
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,152
My wife was hysterical
and she wasn't making much sense.

1729
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:00,798
I thought if I asked her to take an oath
on a rosary it might serve to calm her.

1730
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,279
Make her think more clearly.

1731
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,112
Did the rosary help?

1732
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,788
She was able to tell me, in detail,
what had happened.

1733
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,952
All right, go on from there.
Now, what did you do then?

1734
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:17,355
I had her lie on the bed
and I got some cold cloths for her head.

1735
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,035
I gave her a drink of brandy.

1736
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,475
After a while, she became calm
and seemed to go to sleep.

1737
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:32,991
Then I went to the closet,
I got my gun and I loaded it.

1738
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:37,193
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.

1739
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,829
Then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1740
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,480
I knew I had to go to his place,
I thought I'd need it.

1741
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,549
Why?

1742
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:49,797
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1743
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,595
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you going to do?

1744
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:55,793
I'm not sure.

1745
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,719
I remember having some idea
of finding him...

1746
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,314
...and holding him while I called the police.

1747
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,472
Well, that Mr. What's- his-name...

1748
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:09,598
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court
was a deputy sheriff.

1749
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,557
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

1750
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:16,271
Maybe because he always seemed to be
just the old caretaker of the park.

1751
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:22,593
Maybe I wasn't thinking about anything
too clearly, except finding Barney Quill.

1752
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,236
Why didn't you call the state police
before you went to the bar?

1753
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:27,714
I don't know.

1754
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,392
I was in sort of a daze.

1755
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,832
It was a horrible thing to see
what had been done to my wife.

1756
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,990
You say you were in a sort of a daze.

1757
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:40,908
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1758
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,156
I didn't see anyone at the bar
except Barney Quill.

1759
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:49,953
He was the only person I saw.

1760
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:51,553
What was he doing?

1761
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,917
I think he was just standing there
behind the bar.

1762
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,958
Did he make a threatening move
to get a gun?

1763
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,639
I don't know.

1764
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,278
He may have, I don't know.

1765
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,830
You say you went there to find him,
to hold him for the police?

1766
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,511
Why did you shoot him?

1767
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,430
I don't remember shooting him.

1768
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,115
When you left the bar, do you remember
Alphonse Paquette coming up to you...

1769
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,800
...saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...

1770
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,196
...and your reply,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"

1771
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,079
Remember that?

1772
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:32,199
I seem to have a vague recollection
of someone speaking to me...

1773
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:36,317
...but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

1774
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,234
When did you realize you'd shot Quill?

1775
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,871
I was getting a drink of water.
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

1776
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:53,311
When I put the glass down, I saw the gun
on the kitchen sink beside the tap.

1777
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,870
I noticed the gun was empty.

1778
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,917
I'd like you to show the court and jury...

1779
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,039
...just how you knew this gun was empty.

1780
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:10,030
This gadget here, when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1781
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:15,831
On the night of the shooting,
did you love your wife?

1782
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,548
Yes, sir.

1783
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,791
Do you still love her?

1784
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,439
Very much.

1785
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,072
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1786
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,475
How many men have you killed?

1787
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,198
Now, wait a minute!

1788
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,957
A man's war record,
in Lt. Manion's case a great record...

1789
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,917
...shouldn't be used against him.

1790
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,197
I'm as patriotic as the next man...

1791
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:47,353
...but the simple truth is war can condition
a man to killing other men.

1792
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,471
I just want to know how conditioned...

1793
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:53,639
...the lieutenant may be to the use
of firearms on other human beings.

1794
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,796
I don't like the question...

1795
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:59,156
...but I don't see how I can exclude it.
Let him answer.

1796
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,478
I know I killed at least four men in Korea.

1797
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:06,874
Three with a hand grenade
and one with my service automatic.

1798
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:10,715
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1799
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,671
In these acts of killing,
did you ever have a lapse of memory...

1800
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,558
...like when you killed Barney Quill?
- No, sir.

1801
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,518
- Ever have a memory lapse during battle?
- No, sir.

1802
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,909
Were you ever submitted
to a constant barrage...

1803
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,673
...in a sweat for many hours,
constantly under attack?

1804
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,875
Many times.

1805
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,076
Ever treated for shellshock
or war neurosis?

1806
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:30,229
No, sir.

1807
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,199
Did you ever experience
any unusual mental state during the war?

1808
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:37,108
- I remember having one great urge.
- What was that?

1809
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,918
To get the hell out and go home.

1810
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:44,832
You would do well to consider
the seriousness of the situation you are in.

1811
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,114
Sorry, Your Honour.

1812
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,872
I sympathise with the lieutenant.

1813
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:51,270
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

1814
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:56,634
The point is that during your service there
was never a record of mental disturbance.

1815
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:00,508
- You were always completely sane?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

1816
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,393
No more questions.

1817
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,833
No redirect, Your Honour.

1818
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,275
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

1819
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,794
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

1820
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,074
- Up these stairs to the right.
- Thanks.

1821
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,913
How long after you told your husband
what happened did he leave the trailer?

1822
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:37,829
I don't know exactly.
Everything was kind of fuzzy.

1823
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:42,233
I was faint and I lay down on the bed,
he sat beside me.

1824
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:45,592
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

1825
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:50,037
I remember wondering if he was going
for a doctor, and then he came back in.

1826
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,312
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must've been longer.

1827
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,197
I must've gone to sleep.

1828
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:59,598
When he came back in, he sat on the bed
and he had a gun in his hand.

1829
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,995
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

1830
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:08,394
He said, "I think I've already done it.
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1831
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,592
Are you sure he didn't say,
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

1832
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,073
No. I remember distinctly:
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1833
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,271
Then what did you do?

1834
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:22,035
I put my arms around him
and began to cry.

1835
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,353
I said, "You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

1836
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,396
My husband said, "I forgot about that."

1837
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:30,313
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

1838
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,472
He meant he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

1839
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,275
And he said,
"Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

1840
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,470
I have no other direct questions
at this time.

1841
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:44,112
But, since I'm sure it's difficult
to visualise the part...

1842
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,191
...a little dog played on this night...

1843
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,354
...I should like to show the court
this remarkable little animal.

1844
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:52,237
Do the People object?

1845
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,072
I'm sure if we did...

1846
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,875
...Mr. Biegler would declare
that we're haters of small, furry animals.

1847
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,276
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

1848
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:03,237
Bring in the dog.

1849
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:04,549
Thank you, sir.

1850
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,673
Will the deputy bring in the dog, please?

1851
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,870
Now, you can put him right there.

1852
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,195
Come on.

1853
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:29,198
That's a boy!

1854
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,154
Now, I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

1855
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:48,314
I'll ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

1856
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:00,552
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know
who his enemies are.

1857
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:03,916
Remove the dog, please.
Witness will resume the stand.

1858
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,353
There we go, Muff.

1859
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,473
Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you
on your well-trained pet.

1860
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,716
May I also say that I'm pleased to see...

1861
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,951
...you are not hiding your lovely hair
under a hat.

1862
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,472
Is the assistant attorney general
from Lansing pitching woo...

1863
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,630
...or is he going to cross-examine?

1864
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,028
Let's get on with it.

1865
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,429
What was your occupation
before you were married?

1866
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:28,834
Housewife.

1867
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,279
You were married before?

1868
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:31,588
Yes, once.

1869
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,910
I suppose your first husband died?

1870
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:35,909
No.

1871
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,912
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lt. Manion?

1872
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,913
If counsel wants to know the grounds
for her divorce, let him ask that question.

1873
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,759
- What were they?
- Mental cruelty.

1874
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:50,039
Naturally. How long after your divorce
did you marry Lt. Manion?

1875
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,868
I'm not sure.

1876
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:54,554
May I refresh the witness' memory
for Mr. Dancer?

1877
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,709
By all means.

1878
01:57:56,200 --> 01:58:00,716
I believe she told me that they were
married three days after the divorce.

1879
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,275
- Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?
- Yes.

1880
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,320
Then unless yours was
a whirlwind courtship...

1881
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:09,039
...you must've known Lt. Manion
before your divorce.

1882
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,469
Yes.

1883
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:14,437
Mrs. Manion,
what is your religious affiliation?

1884
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,553
I'm a Catholic.

1885
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,234
A Catholic in good standing?

1886
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,033
No, the divorce, you know.

1887
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:22,918
You were ex-communicated
because of the divorce?

1888
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,989
Yes.

1889
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,830
Wouldn't you say that a Catholic...

1890
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:30,799
...who can blithely ignore
one of the cardinal rules of her Church...

1891
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:34,111
...could also easily ignore
an oath taken on one of its artefacts?

1892
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,111
Say, an oath taken on a rosary?

1893
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,031
I don't think that's true.

1894
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:43,948
Wouldn't there be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person?

1895
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,914
I don't know. All I know is
the rosary means something to me.

1896
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,869
I see.

1897
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,555
I'll pass on to something else.

1898
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,152
You testified that your husband came
home late on the night of the shooting.

1899
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:59,749
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

1900
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:01,552
I guess I was a little put out.

1901
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:04,598
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.

1902
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:08,150
When you left to go to the inn,
did your husband know you were going?

1903
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,788
He was asleep.

1904
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:14,635
Was part of your reason for going without
his knowledge because you were vexed?

1905
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:18,590
I'd been ironing all day...

1906
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,472
Yes, I guess that's true.

1907
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,358
Counsel has deliberately cut off my view
of the witness.

1908
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:27,393
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't interfere
with your signals to Mrs. Manion.

1909
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:29,755
I object to the implication I was signalling.

1910
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,593
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick
I've ever seen.

1911
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,272
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.

1912
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,556
I ask the court to rule on my objection.

1913
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:41,071
Will you be careful not to place yourself
between Mr. Biegler and his witness?

1914
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:42,879
Of course, Your Honour.

1915
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:44,912
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

1916
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,994
You do it again, I'll punt you all the way
out into the middle of Lake Superior.

1917
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:54,113
Gentlemen, this rowing has got to stop.

1918
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:58,474
The next one of you that speaks out of turn
will have me to deal with.

1919
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,596
Now, get on with your cross-examination.

1920
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,838
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had been awake?

1921
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,752
He would have gone with me.

1922
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,319
Would you have gone alone?

1923
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:11,274
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

1924
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:13,789
I'm not sure.
I don't know how to answer that.

1925
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,600
Had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn...

1926
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,513
...or elsewhere in Thunder Bay,
alone at night?

1927
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,312
Yes. Sometimes.

1928
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:23,278
Did your husband know you were going?

1929
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:28,275
Not always. He goes to sleep early
and sometimes I'm restless.

1930
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,670
Where did you go on these occasions?

1931
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:35,197
I'd take a walk by the lake,
or to the bingo place, maybe to the inn.

1932
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,791
Did you ever go to meet another man?

1933
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,789
No, I didn't. I never did that.

1934
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,231
You mean to say a lovely woman
like yourself, attractive to men...

1935
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:46,551
...lonely, restless, that you never...

1936
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:49,717
Objection, the witness has answered
the question about other men.

1937
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:52,360
Counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

1938
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:54,954
I withdraw the question.

1939
02:00:55,640 --> 02:01:00,714
On these occasional excursions into the
night, did you always return home alone?

1940
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:02,559
Of course.

1941
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:06,276
You testified that the reason
you got into Barney Quill's car...

1942
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:08,510
...was that you were afraid
to go home alone.

1943
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:11,353
Why were you so frightened
on this particular night?

1944
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:15,115
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

1945
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:18,590
Was this the first time you'd heard
that bears came around Thunder Bay...

1946
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:21,877
...to pick up scraps?
Had you seen the bears before?

1947
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:22,915
Yes.

1948
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,514
This was just the first time
you were afraid of them?

1949
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,477
No. I was always afraid of them.

1950
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,870
This was just the first time
you were enough afraid to allow a man...

1951
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,996
...to take you home after an evening prowl?

1952
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:36,635
Objection. The use of the word "prowl"
is meant to mislead the jury.

1953
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,711
- Sustained.
- I apologise, Mrs. Manion.

1954
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:42,228
I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

1955
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,709
Was this the first time
you were enough afraid...

1956
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,076
...to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

1957
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,991
It wasn't just that. It was...

1958
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,355
You should be able
to answer that straight off.

1959
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,152
That's a simple enough question.

1960
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:00,159
How can the witness answer straight off,
if counsel keeps interrupting the answer?

1961
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:03,317
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.

1962
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,432
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

1963
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:10,589
In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection
has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time...

1964
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:13,717
...to think of an answer.
You've thought of one, haven't you?

1965
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,836
What I was going to say was that...

1966
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:20,038
...I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill
by making him think I didn't like him.

1967
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:23,596
He'd been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

1968
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,597
That's very good. Very good indeed.

1969
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:26,994
Your Honour, please.

1970
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:31,319
The attorney for the People will reserve
his comments for the arguments.

1971
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,834
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion:

1972
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:38,792
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

1973
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:44,549
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

1974
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,713
Yes, I heard.

1975
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:49,471
Yes, it was the first time.

1976
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,755
Would you raise your voice a little?

1977
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,515
I said it was the first time.

1978
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:01,033
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

1979
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:05,113
Would you describe this article
of clothing to the courtroom?

1980
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:08,198
They were nylon and had lace up the sides.

1981
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,512
There was a store label in them
from the Smartshop in Phoenix, Arizona.

1982
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:14,079
What was their colour?

1983
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:15,793
- I believe white.
- You believe?

1984
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:18,354
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

1985
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:22,314
You're not sure. Haven't you checked
to see which pair of panties is missing?

1986
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,310
When your husband came home late
and you had this little spat...

1987
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,351
...were you already dressed to go out?

1988
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,959
- No.
- When did you dress?

1989
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:31,519
After dinner. When he was asleep.

1990
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,795
It's been stated
you were bare-legged in the bar.

1991
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,518
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1992
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:38,353
In your anger and haste
to get out of the trailer...

1993
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:40,078
...perhaps you forgot your panties?

1994
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:42,913
Objection. She testified
as to what she was wearing.

1995
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:43,989
Sustained.

1996
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,798
Do you always wear panties?

1997
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:48,348
Your Honour,
I object to this line of questioning.

1998
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:51,034
Now, it's immaterial
what she does all the time.

1999
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:53,429
The night of the attack,
she was wearing panties.

2000
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,351
That's all we're concerned with.

2001
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:59,792
Mrs. Manion seems a little uncertain about
what kind of panties she was wearing.

2002
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,438
Since they've not been found...

2003
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:04,996
...I submit that it's possible
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

2004
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,433
That's all I'm getting at.

2005
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,670
You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2006
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:11,391
Do you always wear panties?

2007
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,674
No.

2008
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:17,231
On what occasions don't you?
When you go out alone at night?

2009
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:21,031
Objection. He claims to go after
one thing and goes after another.

2010
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,076
I'll sustain the objection.

2011
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:26,516
Strike out the last two questions
and Mrs. Manion's answers.

2012
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:30,513
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.

2013
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,598
Yes, Your Honour.

2014
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:36,510
Mrs. Manion,
is your husband a jealous man?

2015
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:37,875
He loves me.

2016
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,878
I'm sure of that,
but is he excessively jealous?

2017
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:44,828
How can the witness answer that?
What's the norm of jealousy?

2018
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,759
Can you put your question differently,
Mr. Dancer?

2019
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,553
Has your husband ever struck you
in a jealous rage?

2020
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:54,275
Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevancy of this question?

2021
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:56,271
The shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

2022
02:04:56,360 --> 02:05:00,194
In his own words, this isn't a debate,
it's a cross-examination in a murder trial.

2023
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:02,510
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2024
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:05,038
Mrs. Manion.

2025
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,238
Did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2026
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:10,993
A few times.

2027
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,350
When your husband's outfit moved there...

2028
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:17,672
...didn't Mr. Quill throw a cocktail party
for the officers and their wives?

2029
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,878
Didn't your husband strike
a young second lieutenant at this party?

2030
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:24,395
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.

2031
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,518
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2032
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:31,236
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2033
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:36,989
I think it was because the lieutenant
was cutting in too much...

2034
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:38,718
...when I danced with my husband.

2035
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,677
Shortly afterwards, on the veranda...

2036
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:45,072
...didn't your husband slap you hard
enough so that you fell against the wall?

2037
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,349
He was drinking.

2038
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:50,631
- Wasn't it a jealous rage?
- I don't know.

2039
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,915
- Do you remember why he struck you?
- Yes.

2040
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,278
Wasn't he enraged because he thought
you'd encouraged this young lieutenant?

2041
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,554
He might have thought so.

2042
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,312
There are witnesses to this.

2043
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,675
I'll ask you again,
wasn't this a jealous rage?

2044
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,075
I guess you could call it that.

2045
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,992
Now I'll ask you:

2046
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:13,713
On the night of the shooting,
what did you swear?

2047
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:16,793
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2048
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,755
It was about Barney Quill raping me.

2049
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:23,156
Why did you swear on the rosary
that he'd raped you?

2050
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:25,675
For the reason that he gave:
I was hysterical.

2051
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:27,591
That is why he asked you to swear.

2052
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,511
- Why did you swear?
- So he'd believe me.

2053
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:30,589
Why shouldn't he?

2054
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:33,672
Objection. The reason for the rosary
has been established.

2055
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,432
These questions are immaterial.

2056
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,671
No, I think I'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2057
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:41,718
I'll ask you again.
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2058
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,037
Because I wasn't making much sense.

2059
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:48,196
Did he think you'd lie about such a thing?

2060
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,517
Objection. Lt. Manion has already testified
as to what he thought.

2061
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:52,749
Sustained.

2062
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:56,993
Did your husband strike you that night?
Did he hit you that night?

2063
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,276
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

2064
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,828
Didn't you swear to a lie
to stop him hitting you?

2065
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:08,909
No. I didn't.

2066
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,919
Didn't he beat you at the gate
upon your return from...

2067
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,115
...lovers' lane with Quill?

2068
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:17,115
Objection. She testified
she was beaten by Barney Quill.

2069
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:20,277
- Quiet.
- No more questions.

2070
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:24,314
I think the witness has had enough,
Your Honour.

2071
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,913
The witness may step down.

2072
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:28,429
We'll recess for lunch.

2073
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,152
Recess until 1:00.

2074
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:35,759
It's all right, you were fine.

2075
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:09,559
Dr. Smith?

2076
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,639
I've come to meet you, sir.

2077
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:12,789
My name is...

2078
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,154
Sorry, you're mistaken.

2079
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:17,437
Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2080
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,954
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2081
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:21,439
Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith?

2082
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:22,873
That's me.

2083
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,638
The Army psychiatrist?

2084
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,991
Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

2085
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:28,435
No.

2086
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,590
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2087
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:33,439
I'm forty.

2088
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:38,196
I sort of hoped you'd have a beard
and wear a monocle.

2089
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,594
- Is that better?
- It helps.

2090
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:46,148
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2091
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,033
Have you formed an opinion
as to Frederick Manion's...

2092
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:53,793
...mental and emotional state
when he killed Barney Quill?

2093
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:55,558
- I have.
- And what is it?

2094
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:58,518
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2095
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:02,792
At that time, do you believe he was able
to distinguish right from wrong?

2096
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,111
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make much difference.

2097
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,710
As clearly as you can...

2098
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:12,356
...will you explain
Manion's temporary insanity?

2099
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,034
It is known as "dissociative reaction."

2100
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:20,111
A psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension...

2101
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:22,873
...which the person in shock must alleviate.

2102
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:25,594
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...

2103
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:28,353
...it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2104
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:31,989
Only direct, simple action
against Barney Quill...

2105
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:34,036
...would relieve this unbearable tension.

2106
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,708
This is not uncommon.

2107
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:38,997
For example, in combat,
some of the more remarkable heroics...

2108
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:40,832
...take place in this state of mind.

2109
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:44,708
Is there another name for this state
we might be more likely to recognise?

2110
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,837
Yes, it has been known
as "irresistible impulse."

2111
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:52,388
A man in the grip of irresistible impulse,
would he be likely to go...

2112
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:56,268
...to his neighbour for advice,
or call up the police to come to his aid?

2113
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:57,714
Completely incompatible.

2114
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:02,158
Yes, but our man was able
to take out a gun and load it...

2115
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:03,958
...before setting out to find Quill.

2116
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:05,792
That was his conscious mind.

2117
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:08,440
But if no gun were available,
he would've gone anyway.

2118
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:12,115
How would a man look
in the grip of dissociative reaction?

2119
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:16,079
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2120
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:21,311
Would you describe his behaviour as being
like a mailman delivering the mail?

2121
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:25,951
Yes. Like a mailman, he would have
a job to do and he would do it.

2122
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:28,314
Your witness.

2123
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:31,914
Did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2124
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,797
- I did not.
- Any neurosis?

2125
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:35,950
I found no history of neurosis.

2126
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:39,470
- Any history of delusion?
- None.

2127
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:42,199
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.

2128
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,198
Can you spot Mary Pilant?

2129
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:49,949
She didn't come back after lunch.
I think you'd better give up on that one.

2130
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:53,638
Doctor, you stated that the defendant
might or might not...

2131
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:56,320
...have been able to distinguish
right from wrong...

2132
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,470
...but it wouldn't have made a difference.

2133
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,312
- Is that what you said?
- Approximately.

2134
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:04,154
So, at the time of the shooting,
he could have known the difference?

2135
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,992
He might have, yes.

2136
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,479
Dr. Smith...

2137
02:11:07,720 --> 02:11:12,475
...if the defendant could have known
what he was doing and that it was wrong...

2138
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:15,279
...how can you testify
that he was legally insane?

2139
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:17,669
I'm not saying he was legally insane.

2140
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:21,116
I'm saying that in his condition
it wouldn't have made a difference...

2141
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:24,795
...whether he knew right from wrong.
He would still have shot Quill.

2142
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,871
Dr. Smith...

2143
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,839
...are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2144
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,239
Yes, I am.

2145
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:36,599
Your Honour,
I'd like to ask for a short recess.

2146
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:39,877
We would like to meet with Mr. Biegler
and the court in chambers.

2147
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,474
- Mr. Biegler?
- Glad to oblige, Your Honour.

2148
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:45,753
Short recess. The jury will remain.

2149
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:02,358
Someday I'm going to horrify tradition
and lay a dense cloud of tobacco smoke...

2150
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,431
...in that hallowed courtroom.

2151
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:06,989
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2152
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:10,999
In view of Dr. Smith's testimony,
the defence might like to change their plea.

2153
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:13,878
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2154
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,473
No, we'll still go for broke.

2155
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:20,278
No one's considered nuts
unless he didn't know right from wrong.

2156
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:24,672
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honour, would you turn to page 486?

2157
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,154
What's that?

2158
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,875
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2159
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:32,671
I'm sorry, Your Honour.

2160
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,955
I make those to help me think sometimes.

2161
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:37,680
- For perch?
- No, it's for frogs.

2162
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,512
What case is he citing?

2163
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:42,195
We gig frogs
down in my part of the country.

2164
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:43,315
It's the same up here.

2165
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:46,312
I'm a trout man,
but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.

2166
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:48,152
They do it a lot down in the bayou.

2167
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:51,835
The idea is to get a great big long pole
and a 10-pound line.

2168
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,514
Just drift along a high bank in a boat.

2169
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:59,876
Then you see that great big old bullfrog
in a crevice, and you float this along...

2170
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,356
...in front of him
and that old tongue snaps out.

2171
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,998
You got frog's legs for supper.

2172
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,354
I'll be darned.

2173
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,953
Keep it. Try it sometime.

2174
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,712
Thanks. I will.

2175
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:11,958
486.

2176
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,153
- What is it, Your Honour?
- People versus Durfee, 1886.

2177
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,951
Looks like a precedent.

2178
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:22,196
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?

2179
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:27,033
No, thank you. I think I recall the case.

2180
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:31,679
We're hooked, like the frog.

2181
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,798
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

2182
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:39,711
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.

2183
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:41,756
And where do you practise now?

2184
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:45,594
I'm the medical superintendent
of the Bonder State Hospital for the insane.

2185
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:50,356
It's been stated that dissociative reaction
or irresistible impulse...

2186
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:53,239
...is not uncommon
among soldiers in combat.

2187
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:55,959
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do.

2188
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,871
But not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

2189
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,632
Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?

2190
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:03,474
Dissociative reaction is not something
that comes out of the blue...

2191
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:05,471
...and disappears as quickly.

2192
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:09,553
It can only occur,
even among soldiers in combat...

2193
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:13,275
...if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

2194
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:16,598
It has been testified here
that a psychiatric examination...

2195
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:19,558
...of the defendant showed
no evidence of neurosis...

2196
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:21,915
...and no history of dissociative reaction.

2197
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,072
You've also heard it testified
that the defendant's behaviour...

2198
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:28,277
...on the night of the shooting
was cool and direct.

2199
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:31,751
- As an observer, do you remember this?
- Yes.

2200
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:34,993
Have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity...

2201
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:36,593
...on the night of the shooting?

2202
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:38,119
Yes. I'm of the opinion...

2203
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:41,078
...that he was in sufficient possession
of his faculties...

2204
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:43,720
...so he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2205
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:47,270
In other words, he was not in the grip
of irresistible impulse.

2206
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,913
In my opinion, he was not.

2207
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,115
Your witness.

2208
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,274
Psychiatry is an effort to probe into
the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.

2209
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:58,751
In there, the world might be round,
it could be square.

2210
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,669
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's
opinion could be right, is that true?

2211
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:05,069
I'd be a poor doctor
if I didn't agree with that.

2212
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:07,913
But, I believe my opinion to be right.

2213
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,869
Might you have changed your opinion...

2214
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,315
...if you'd examined the defendant
like Dr. Smith?

2215
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:15,475
I don't believe so.

2216
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:18,558
But Smith's opinion was made
under better circumstances?

2217
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:21,514
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2218
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,438
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

2219
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,512
That's all, Dr. Harcourt.
Is there more rebuttal?

2220
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:28,717
We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2221
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,911
We have to use him.

2222
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:33,836
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2223
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:36,111
Will the sheriff bring in the witness?

2224
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,679
What can he tell?

2225
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:46,068
Nothing.

2226
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:48,912
He can't tell anything.

2227
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,794
Raise your right hand.

2228
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,791
Do you swear the testimony you give...

2229
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:05,917
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

2230
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:06,989
I do.

2231
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:11,033
State your name, please.

2232
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:13,588
Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.

2233
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:15,398
Where do you presently reside?

2234
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,716
Across the alley, in the jail.

2235
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:19,631
You know the defendant, Lt. Manion?

2236
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,753
I got to know him recently.
His cell's next to mine.

2237
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:25,075
When was your last conversation?

2238
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:28,677
Except for "hello" this morning,
it was last night.

2239
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:31,115
Did you discuss his trial last night?

2240
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:32,269
Yeah, some.

2241
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:35,397
Would you tell the court
what Lt. Manion said about the trial?

2242
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:38,278
I said, "Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2243
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:41,674
He said, "I got it made, buster."

2244
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:45,913
He said, "I fooled my lawyer,
I fooled that head-shrinker...

2245
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:48,509
"... l'm gonna fool
those corn-cobbers on the jury."

2246
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:49,835
You're a liar!

2247
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,195
A lousy stinking liar!

2248
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:58,515
I apologise for my client, Your Honour.

2249
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,390
His outburst is almost excusable
since the prosecution has seen fit...

2250
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:06,359
...to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the U.S. Army.

2251
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:10,029
I don't know who is the worst offender:
Manion or his lawyer.

2252
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,391
We're close to the end.

2253
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:17,509
In the name of heaven, let's have peace
and courtesy for these last few hours.

2254
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:22,113
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2255
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:26,031
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off
at every opportunity.

2256
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,879
The defendant will remain seated
and keep his mouth shut.

2257
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,155
- Now, go ahead.
- Mr. Miller.

2258
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:33,954
Are you certain that Lt. Manion said:

2259
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:37,198
- "I've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.

2260
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,919
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?
- Yes, sir.

2261
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:42,874
He said when he got out,
the first thing he'd do...

2262
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,599
...was kick that bitch
from here to kingdom come.

2263
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:49,434
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2264
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:51,959
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2265
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,235
- What're you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.

2266
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:57,231
I copped out
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2267
02:17:57,320 --> 02:17:59,231
How many other crimes
have you committed?

2268
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:02,398
I was in reform school when I was a kid,
but that's all.

2269
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:05,475
I'd like to see this man's criminal record.

2270
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:07,551
Do you have his record?

2271
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:08,749
Yes, sir.

2272
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,148
Here it is.

2273
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:18,797
Your record shows you've been in prison
six times in three different states.

2274
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:24,549
Been in three times for arson,
twice for assault, once for larceny.

2275
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:29,878
It also shows you've done
short stretches in four city jails...

2276
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:33,555
...on charges of indecent exposure,
window-peeping...

2277
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:36,108
...perjury and disorderly conduct.

2278
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:39,072
Is this your true record?

2279
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:41,679
Them things are never right.

2280
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:44,155
How did you get the ear
of the prosecution...

2281
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:47,590
...to tell them about this conversation
you had with Lt. Manion?

2282
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:50,240
- The D.A. Was taking us to his office.
- Taking who?

2283
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:51,879
Us prisoners, in the jail.

2284
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,638
All at once, or one at a time?

2285
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:55,028
One at a time.

2286
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:58,198
Him and that other lawyer
took us to his office...

2287
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:00,430
...and asked us questions about Lt. Manion.

2288
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:04,110
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand?

2289
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,589
- The People object...
- Overruled. Answer.

2290
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:08,233
I wasn't promised anything.

2291
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:10,072
You just thought it would help you...

2292
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:12,515
...if you dreamed up this story
to please the D.A.

2293
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:13,868
I didn't dream it up.

2294
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:16,110
- You're sure that's what he said?
- I'm sure.

2295
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:18,435
As sure as you were about your record?

2296
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:21,110
I guess I kind of goofed on that one.

2297
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:28,235
I don't feel I can dignify this creature
with any more questions.

2298
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:29,953
Take the witness away.

2299
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,797
Would you like a conference
with your client?

2300
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:35,678
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2301
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:38,190
No, we don't need a conference.

2302
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:40,834
I'll recall Lt. Manion to the stand right now.

2303
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:51,673
You've heard the testimony of this Miller.

2304
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,359
Is any part of it true?

2305
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,635
None.

2306
02:19:56,480 --> 02:20:00,519
Do you have any idea why he might come
here with a tale like that?

2307
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:01,709
No, sir.

2308
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,956
Have you ever talked with this man?

2309
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,189
Yes.

2310
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:09,639
What did you talk about?

2311
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:13,312
Nothing important.

2312
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:17,110
Certainly nothing about my personal life
or my feelings.

2313
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,672
That's all I wanted to know.

2314
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,352
Lt. Manion.

2315
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:26,756
Have you ever had any trouble with Miller?

2316
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:30,868
What do you mean?
An argument, something like that?

2317
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:34,789
Did you ever attack Miller?
Physically attack him?

2318
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,434
Your lawyer can't answer the question
for you.

2319
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:40,357
Did you ever attack Miller?

2320
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:42,749
I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.

2321
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:44,996
I pushed his head against the bars once.

2322
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:47,958
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.

2323
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:51,551
Do you remember pushing or bumping
his head against the bars?

2324
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:53,717
Sure. I just told you.

2325
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:55,996
Then this was not dissociative reaction?

2326
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,833
- The defendant isn't qualified to answer.
- Sustained.

2327
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:00,512
Lt. Manion.

2328
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:04,839
Wasn't your action against Quill
the same as your action against Miller...

2329
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:07,912
...and against the lieutenant
you struck at the cocktail party?

2330
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:11,953
All in the heat of anger, with a wilful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2331
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,636
I don't remember my action against Quill.

2332
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:19,037
How long had you known
your wife was running around with Quill?

2333
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:22,551
I never knew anything like that.

2334
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:24,829
I trust my wife.

2335
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:28,679
I suppose you beat her up occasionally
just for fun?

2336
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:31,593
Nothing has been established
to permit such a question.

2337
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,116
He implies things
without getting to the point.

2338
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:37,516
Let him ask, "Did he ever beat his wife?"

2339
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,192
I'll sustain the objection.

2340
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:41,834
Would you like to rephrase your question?

2341
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:44,839
No, thank you.

2342
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,159
I've finished.

2343
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:49,078
Then I'll ask it.

2344
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,510
Did you ever beat your wife,
on the night of the shooting...

2345
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,198
...or at any other time?
- No.

2346
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:57,955
Is there any doubt in your mind
that Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2347
02:21:58,040 --> 02:21:59,473
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2348
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,874
Step down, Lieutenant.

2349
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:09,475
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2350
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:10,829
Paul.

2351
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:18,995
I know time is pressing,
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2352
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,917
I'd like to leave the courtroom briefly.

2353
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,474
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2354
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,392
Thank you, sir.

2355
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,196
This is highly irregular, Your Honour.

2356
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:31,233
There's no reason
to make a federal case out of it.

2357
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,519
Thank you, Your Honour.

2358
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,710
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2359
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:47,631
The defence calls Mary Pilant.

2360
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:49,836
We must protest this whole affair.

2361
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:52,872
The noble defence attorney
rushes to a secret conference...

2362
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:55,793
...and the last-minute witness
is brought dramatically in.

2363
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:58,957
It's obviously been rigged
to unduly excite the jury.

2364
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,110
It's just another cornball trick.

2365
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:04,391
Your Honour, I don't blame Mr. Dancer
for feeling put upon.

2366
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:07,278
I'm just a humble country lawyer,
trying to do my best...

2367
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:10,670
...against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2368
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:12,592
Swear the witness.

2369
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:14,754
Raise your right hand.

2370
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:16,796
Do you swear the testimony you give...

2371
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:20,555
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

2372
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:22,438
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2373
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:28,592
- Where do you live?
- At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.

2374
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:31,353
- How long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2375
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:34,520
- What's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2376
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,393
Miss Pilant.

2377
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:39,034
How is the laundry handled at the inn?

2378
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:41,151
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2379
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,800
Where is that chute on the second floor?

2380
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:45,876
Between Room 42 and 43.

2381
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:47,359
Who lives in those rooms?

2382
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:50,750
I live in 42, Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2383
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,514
Would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2384
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:56,910
...have to pass by that chute
on the way to his room?

2385
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:59,198
- Yes.
- Would it be easy for him...

2386
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,669
...to drop something
into that chute as he passed?

2387
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:02,795
Yes.

2388
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:06,156
Have you ever had occasion
to go down into the laundry?

2389
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:09,670
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2390
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:12,155
...as they come out of the machines.

2391
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:15,038
Would you tell us
what you found among the laundry...

2392
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:17,276
...the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2393
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,590
I found a pair of woman's panties.

2394
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:22,598
- What did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2395
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,632
When did you learn the significance
of those panties?

2396
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:28,714
Here. This morning in the courtroom.

2397
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:31,348
- You went and got them out of the rag bin?
- Yes.

2398
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,590
- Did you bring them with you?
- Yes.

2399
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:41,918
I offer this article of lingerie
as "Exhibit Number 1" for the defence.

2400
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:43,314
They're white.

2401
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:45,676
They have lace up the side...

2402
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:48,158
...and they're badly torn.

2403
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:51,591
As if they'd been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2404
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,077
The label reads:

2405
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:57,755
"Smartshop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2406
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:01,351
If there is no objection,
the exhibit will be received in evidence.

2407
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:02,469
That's all.

2408
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:05,472
Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick
about Quill's death?

2409
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:08,991
Yes. He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2410
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:12,351
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2411
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:13,429
Yes, I told him that.

2412
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:17,149
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?
- Yes.

2413
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:19,549
- In connection with Quill's death?
- Yes.

2414
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,274
Did you tell him
you didn't believe Quill raped her?

2415
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:24,510
- How many times did you talk with him?
- Twice.

2416
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:26,591
- When was the last time?
- Last night.

2417
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:28,238
Have you now changed your mind?

2418
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:30,510
Do you now believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2419
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:33,155
I don't know now. I think he might have.

2420
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:35,356
When did you change your mind,
last night?

2421
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:37,232
No, it was here, this morning.

2422
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:39,595
When were you given the panties?
Last night?

2423
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:42,951
- Just wait a minute!
- Use the proper form of objection.

2424
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:46,989
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2425
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,599
The witness may answer.

2426
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:52,559
No. I was not given the panties,
last night or any other time.

2427
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,312
I found them exactly as I said.

2428
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:57,119
Do you know that Quill
put the panties in the chute...

2429
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:59,071
...or did you assume it?
- I assumed it.

2430
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,549
Had you thought someone else
may have put them there?

2431
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:03,676
Someone who wanted them found
in the laundry?

2432
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:05,432
I hadn't thought of that.

2433
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,115
In the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call "irresistible impulse"...

2434
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:11,118
...you rushed in with the panties...

2435
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:15,239
...wanting to crucify Quill's character?
- No, it was my duty.

2436
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:18,079
- Your pride was hurt, right?
- I don't know what you mean.

2437
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:22,073
He's trying to confuse the witness.
Let him ask a question she understands.

2438
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:26,029
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I, myself,
would like to know what you're driving at.

2439
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:29,118
When you found the panties...

2440
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:32,836
...was your first thought that Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2441
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:36,151
...or was it that he might have been
stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2442
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:38,392
I don't know what he means.

2443
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:40,550
Mr. Dancer, once again, I must ask you...

2444
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:43,029
...to put straight questions to the witness.

2445
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:45,754
Here is a straight question, Your Honour.

2446
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,995
Miss Pilant,
were you Barney Quill's mistress?

2447
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:50,832
No, I was not!

2448
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:52,831
Everyone knows you were living with Quill.

2449
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:54,911
That's not true. Barney Quill was...

2450
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,479
Was what?

2451
02:26:57,360 --> 02:26:59,635
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

2452
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,510
Barney Quill was my father.

2453
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:16,313
No more questions.

2454
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,433
That's all.

2455
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:21,677
The witness may step down.

2456
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:26,431
We will recess for 15 minutes, after which
we will hear the closing arguments.

2457
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:30,874
If possible, I would like to charge the jury
before nightfall.

2458
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:48,349
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2459
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:04,591
Can't somebody say something?

2460
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,190
What do you want me to say,
Maida, darling?

2461
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:11,118
Tell me we're gonna win.

2462
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:16,149
I'm counting on getting that
promissory note from the lieutenant.

2463
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:20,154
I hope we can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.

2464
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:23,990
Half the time, the "P" and the "F"
don't strike on mine.

2465
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:28,952
"Party of the first part" sometimes
comes out "arty o the irst art."

2466
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:32,268
Doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.

2467
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:34,277
"Arty o the irst art"?

2468
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:36,512
I kind of like that.

2469
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:38,872
It has a ring to it.

2470
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:44,598
Twelve people go off into a room.

2471
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:47,472
Twelve different minds.

2472
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,478
Twelve different hearts.

2473
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,070
Twelve different walks of life.

2474
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:56,596
Twelve sets of eyes,
ears, shapes and sizes.

2475
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:02,515
These twelve people are asked to judge
another human being...

2476
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:05,952
...as different from them
as they are from each other.

2477
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:10,752
In their judgement, they must become
of one mind, unanimous.

2478
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:16,679
It's one of the miracles of man's
disorganised soul that they can do it.

2479
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:20,233
In most instances, do it right well.

2480
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:24,034
God bless juries.

2481
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:28,193
I don't know what I'd do
if I were on that jury.

2482
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:33,437
I really don't know.

2483
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:35,909
Do you?

2484
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:42,152
I loved that, Pauly.

2485
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:45,358
I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.

2486
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:48,470
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2487
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:53,555
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.
That's the best summary I've ever heard.

2488
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,389
I liked yours much better, Pauly.

2489
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:02,719
Do you have to play that?

2490
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:06,150
Can't you play <i>Danny Boy</i>
or <i>Sweet Isle of Innisfree?</i>

2491
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,873
Paul Biegler's office.

2492
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:23,113
Yes, sir. Right away.

2493
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:24,874
They're ready.

2494
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:36,558
Hey, sweetie!

2495
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:39,473
Go on.

2496
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,835
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

2497
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:45,559
You can tell my loving husband
I'll be in the car.

2498
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:48,558
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Sure.

2499
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:49,914
He's lucky.

2500
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:52,310
Some people have all the luck.

2501
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:56,115
You can tell him I'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2502
02:30:56,640 --> 02:30:58,039
Hey, sweetie.

2503
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:01,473
I have a souvenir for you.

2504
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:04,237
You'd better keep that.

2505
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:07,034
You might need it again sometime.
You never know.

2506
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:08,678
No, you don't, do you?

2507
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,997
I like you, Pauly.

2508
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,436
I warn all those present
not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2509
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:24,239
I will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

2510
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:26,550
...if there is any demonstration.

2511
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:36,711
Proceed, Mr. Cray.

2512
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:39,229
Members of the jury, have you a verdict?

2513
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:42,870
- If so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.

2514
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,956
The defendant will rise.

2515
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:48,435
What is your verdict?

2516
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:52,035
We find the defendant not guilty,
by reason of insanity.

2517
02:31:57,440 --> 02:31:59,670
Did Maida give you that promissory note?

2518
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:03,076
Right here,
ready to be signed by our happy client.

2519
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:07,156
I used to think the world looked better
through a glass of whiskey.

2520
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:08,593
It doesn't.

2521
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:10,998
I think I'll keep it this way.

2522
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:12,559
It looks nice.

2523
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,669
I got one good thing out of this case:

2524
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:18,068
A new law partner.

2525
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:20,230
If it's all right with him.

2526
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:24,036
He'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

2527
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:55,598
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion,
aren't you?

2528
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:57,837
He gave me this note for you.

2529
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:01,111
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.

2530
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,713
She was crying.

2531
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:04,878
Left a mess, didn't they?

2532
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,916
We'd better get busy here.

2533
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,598
"Dear Mr. Biegler:

2534
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:10,636
"So sorry, but I had to leave suddenly.

2535
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:13,029
"I was seized by an irresistible impulse.

2536
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,238
"Frederick Manion."

2537
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:19,073
How in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

2538
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:21,349
Gin.

2539
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:24,229
I knew there was something wrong
with that guy.

2540
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:26,828
I never saw a gin-drinker yet
you could trust.

2541
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,992
Partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

2542
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:32,275
Who might that be?

2543
02:33:32,360 --> 02:33:35,511
Mary Pilant. We're going to administer
Barney Quill's estate.

2544
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:38,956
Now, that's what I call
poetic justice for everybody.

2545
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,549
Yeah.

2546
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:00,791
