1
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,896
Hi, Toybull.

2
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,265
Hey, your pal just drove
into town, Mr. McCarthy.

3
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,206
I'll have one more, Toybull.

4
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,511
I'm afraid I'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

5
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,638
You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.

6
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,648
Thank you, Toybull.

7
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,613
Good night, Toybull.

8
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,249
Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

9
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,806
Operator.

10
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,183
Operator, I want...

11
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,415
489 Thunder Bay.

12
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,821
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

13
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,120
M-A-N-l-O-N.

14
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,287
This is Paul Biegler speaking.

15
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,422
Iron City 700.

16
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,274
- Do they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't.

17
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,407
I see. Just leave a message.
Tell her to call this number.

18
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,213
Thank you.

19
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,951
- What do you say there, counselor?
- Save your money.

20
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,962
What's in the brown paper bag?

21
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,294
It might be a cabbage head.

22
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,300
Bet it wouldn't be.

23
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,098
You're a very suspicious man.

24
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,410
True, I'm everlastingly
suspicious of...

25
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,912
and/or fascinated by...

26
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,984
the contents of brown paper bags.

27
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,452
- Shall I sneak a peek?
- You do that, counselor.

28
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,056
You do that.

29
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,753
After you sneak a peek, why, you...

30
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,228
uncork whatever you find.

31
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,437
- Shall I pour?
- Be a privilege.

32
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,439
My pleasure, sir.

33
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,043
You fought this soldier by yourself.

34
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,316
You've been drinking alone, Paulie.

35
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,483
I don't like that.

36
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,756
Drop the stone, counselor.
You live in a glass house.

37
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,025
My windows have been busted long ago,
so I can say as I please.

38
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,695
Have an Italian cigar?

39
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,966
No, thanks.

40
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,339
Those stinkweeds are another sign
of your decadence.

41
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,272
Paulie, it's a fact.

42
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,784
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out of
the office of public prosecutor...

43
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,685
you haven't been worth
salt for peanuts.

44
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,951
Not that I don't understand
how you feel.

45
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,088
A man gets beat out of an office
he's held for a long time...

46
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,764
he feels his community
has deserted him.

47
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,131
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.

48
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,228
None but the lonely hearts
shall know my anguish.

49
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,399
Paulie, you're a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

50
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,307
Be here ready for clients,
not out fishing and playing that...

51
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,209
rooty-tooty jazz.

52
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,077
Oh, I'm making a living.

53
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,151
I run a few abstracts...

54
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,243
how to divorce Jane Doe
from John Doe every once in a while.

55
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,948
Threaten a few deadbeats.

56
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,924
And in the evening,
I sit around and drink bourbon whisky...

57
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,986
and read law
with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy...

58
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,463
one of the world's great men.

59
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,331
That was a kind word, Paulie.

60
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,199
You know...

61
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,205
I might have been.

62
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,437
That's one of the reasons I hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

63
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,978
I look at you, and I see myself
years ago...

64
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,072
with the same love for the smell
of the old brown books...

65
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,276
and the dusty office.

66
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,547
Here's the rose.

67
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,023
A lily.
A sweet lupine.

68
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,459
The United States
Supreme Court reports.

69
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,458
Well...

70
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,126
what shall we read
this evening, counselor?

71
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,103
How about a little
Chief Justice Holmes?

72
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,471
Keep Chief Justice on hold for a moment.
I might have a client.

73
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,070
- Waiting for a call. Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?

74
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,309
- This is Paul Biegler speaking.
- It's your party.

75
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,647
- Hello? Mrs. Manion?
- What?

76
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,380
Mr. Biegler?

77
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,820
I'm sorry I missed you a while ago.
Did you get my message?

78
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,415
- Who is that? What is that name?
- Just a minute, please.

79
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,052
We seem to have a bad connection.
Hold on.

80
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,529
It's a woman, name of Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

81
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,498
- In Thunder Bay?
- Uh-huh.

82
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,432
If she wants you to represent
her husband, say yes.

83
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,938
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

84
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,405
- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?

85
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,841
Oh, yes. This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

86
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,641
I've waited for your call
all afternoon.

87
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,649
Yes, well, I just got in
a few moments ago.

88
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,276
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

89
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,752
Yes.

90
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,824
Mr. Biegler, have you read
about my husband? Muffy, please.

91
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,691
Well, uh, yes, I have, a little.

92
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,094
- Will you defend him?
- I don't know.

93
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,361
- I'd have to know more about it.
- Will you talk to him?

94
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,369
Mr. Biegler, he's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?

95
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:36,305
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.

96
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,138
I have?

97
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,407
Yes, someone told him about you.
Will you see him?

98
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,312
I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

99
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,713
- Would you want me there too?
- I think that'd be fine.

100
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,085
Let's make it about 10:00.

101
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,658
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

102
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,057
Yes, you're quite welcome.
Bye.

103
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,754
Now, what's this all about?

104
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,889
A man named Barney Quill
raped Mrs. Manion.

105
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,230
Her husband, he's a lieutenant
in the army...

106
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,203
there's a temporary base in Thunder Bay,
a gunnery or something...

107
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:11,004
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Mr. Quill about five times...

108
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,943
which causes Mr. Quill to promptly die
of lead poisoning.

109
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,946
- When did this happen?
- A couple of nights ago.

110
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,710
If you hadn't been out fishing
in some godforsaken backwater...

111
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,718
you'd have known about it.

112
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,090
- Morning, Maida.
- Oh, there it is.

113
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,097
- What?
- The newspaper.

114
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,464
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.
We haven't paid the bill.

115
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,333
- Did you get my note?
- Uh-huh. We may be on the case.

116
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,670
I'm just reading up on it now
before talking to Lt. Manion.

117
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,538
Doesn't he ever go home?

118
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,636
Oh, you mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.

119
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,510
Is that a fact?

120
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,914
I think maybe you better cancel
all my appointments for today.

121
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,682
What appointments? People think
you've migrated into the woods.

122
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,690
If this refrigerator gets any more
fish in it, it'll swim upstream...

123
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,024
and spawn all by itself.

124
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,356
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

125
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,198
I was going over
your checkbook yesterday.

126
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,433
I can't pay me my salary.

127
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,009
What did you do with the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

128
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,410
Help salt a uranium mine
or something?

129
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:32,245
- Bought a few bare necessities.
- Like a new outboard motor.

130
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,514
I wish I could be classed
as a necessity.

131
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,022
- Aren't you gonna have your toast?
- No, no, I'll, uh...

132
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,561
I'll call you,
let you know how things are going.

133
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,152
Don't let him pay you off
in Purple Hearts.

134
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,858
Those professional soldiers
never have a dime.

135
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,561
I ought to know.
I was married to one.

136
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,388
Beg your pardon.
Are you Mrs. Manion?

137
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,790
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

138
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,829
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

139
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,199
- This is Muff.
- Oh, Muff.

140
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,200
The jail's right here.

141
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,895
You're tall.

142
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,068
- Hello, Paulie!
- Hi, Sulo.

143
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,080
You wait here, Muffy.

144
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,020
- Good to see you, Paulie.
- How you feeling?

145
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,886
Fine. I guess you come
for the soldier boy.

146
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,755
Yeah. Do you think it'd be all right
if we talk in the sheriff's office?

147
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,920
Oh, sure, Paulie.
I'll bring him down.

148
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,835
Would you mind taking
your glasses off, Mrs. Manion?

149
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,947
Did Barney Quill do that to you?

150
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,017
Mm-hmm. More than that.

151
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,017
You should see. All over.

152
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,848
You can put them back on
if it's more comfortable for you.

153
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,896
This is Paulie Biegler.
This is the bucko, Paulie.

154
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,335
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Manny.

155
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,339
Hello, Laura.

156
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,442
Mrs. Manion, can you meet me down in
my office about 2:00 this afternoon?

157
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,573
It's 305 West Barnham.

158
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,708
- Of course.
- Fine.

159
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,413
Is there anything
I can get you, hon?

160
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,421
I'm all right, hon.

161
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,753
Right in here.

162
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,869
Wanted. The big ten.

163
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,076
They got the ten best-dressed dames...

164
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,614
the ten top teams,
the ten top tunes...

165
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,444
and now the ten most wanted.

166
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,816
Don't knock it. That's the American
dream. Those boys made the grade.

167
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,221
You were the...

168
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,350
district attorney around here,
weren't you?

169
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,519
Ten years.

170
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,654
What's your experience
as a defense lawyer?

171
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,565
- Not very much.
- How do I know you can handle my case?

172
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,570
I guess you don't know.

173
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,640
Shall we talk about it?

174
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,174
I suppose so.

175
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,911
Come on, Lieutenant.
Don't be so bored.

176
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,380
It might very well be that no lawyer
can handle your case...

177
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,678
if you mean
getting you off scot-free.

178
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,983
You seemed to be forgetting
Barney Quill raped my wife.

179
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,182
I have the unwritten law
on my side.

180
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,055
The unwritten law's a myth,
Lieutenant.

181
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,857
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law.

182
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,933
And anyone who commits a murder
on the theory that it does exist...

183
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,127
has just bought himself room and board
in the state penitentiary.

184
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,965
Maybe for life.

185
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:18,067
Now, with that in mind,
perhaps we can proceed with a...

186
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,645
few questions and answers that...

187
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,907
That, uh...
Can I borrow your lighter?

188
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:31,281
We can proceed with a few questions and
answers that might help your defense.

189
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,059
But it probably won't be.

190
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,361
Yes. Nice lighter.

191
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,168
- Okay.
- How old are you?

192
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,739
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?

193
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,832
Since '50.

194
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
- You see any action?
- Korea.

195
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,978
- Have any decorations?
- Plenty.

196
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,642
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.

197
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,778
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.

198
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,948
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

199
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,550
- Is this necessary?
- I'll be the judge of that.

200
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,555
My first wife divorced me.

201
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,395
Charged cruelty.

202
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,233
Eating crackers in bed.
You know, the usual stuff.

203
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,863
Truth was...

204
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,499
she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

205
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,111
I met Laura four years ago
in Georgia.

206
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,740
We were married
right after her divorce.

207
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,319
Did you know the husband?

208
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,687
- He was in my outfit down there.
- You mean, you were buddies?

209
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,193
I'll withdraw the question.
It's a little old-fashioned.

210
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,822
Have there been any children
by or from any of these marriages?

211
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,129
- No.
- Any present prospects?

212
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,499
Not unless Barney Quill
started something.

213
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,765
What kind of a gun did you use?

214
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,206
War souvenir. A Luger.
The police have it now.

215
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,438
I suppose you've read the newspapers,
the stories about your case.

216
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,244
- Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?

217
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,444
And you didn't see Quill rape
and beat your wife?

218
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,613
No. No.

219
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,054
When she got back...

220
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,126
to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

221
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,025
And how long was it before you went
over to Quill's and killed him?

222
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,995
I don't know exactly.
Maybe an hour.

223
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,533
That long, huh?

224
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,092
The newspapers say that your wife
volunteered to take a lie detector test.

225
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,606
- Do you know anything about this?
- Only what I read and what she told me.

226
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,233
Do you know how
the lie detector test turned out?

227
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,743
They didn't tell her.

228
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,213
- Yes, Sulo?
- We got lunch served for the jail.

229
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,116
- You want to eat with us?
- Your sister still cook for the jail?

230
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,120
Oh, sure. She cooks.

231
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,384
Well, you give her
my compliments, Sulo.

232
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,461
I've got a luncheon date downtown.

233
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,654
- Nice going, Mr. Biegler.
- I'll be back after lunch.

234
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:56,223
Look, I'm sorry
if I offended you a while ago.

235
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,270
No, you're not.

236
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,669
Come on, bucko.

237
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,331
Thank you.

238
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,710
Pass the salt, Paulie.

239
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,939
Thank you.

240
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,708
Did you give the lieutenant
the well known lecture?

241
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,450
If you mean, did I coach him into
a phony story, no.

242
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,356
Maybe you're too pure, Paul.

243
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,227
Too pure for the natural impurities
of the law.

244
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,358
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
the chance to find a defense.

245
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,131
Could also be that you might guide him
a little, show him the way...

246
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,399
and let him decide
if he wants to take it.

247
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,032
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.

248
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,543
Anyway, I'm not the right lawyer
for this fellow.

249
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,910
He's insolent, hostile...

250
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,543
You don't have to love him.
Just defend him.

251
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,678
What's the matter?
Don't you need a fee?

252
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,655
You know something? I think
you might be a little bit afraid.

253
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,888
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

254
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,630
You know, there's only one thing more
devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

255
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,830
and that's an Irish lawyer.

256
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,464
Pass the salt.

257
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,211
Put it down.

258
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,580
- Hello there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

259
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,591
You gonna have some more jokes?

260
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,718
Not unless you want to be
the comic.

261
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,525
Oh, I brought you some cigarettes.

262
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,532
- Oh, thanks.
- Peace?

263
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,626
- Sure.
- Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...

264
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,036
there are four ways
I can defend murder.

265
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,735
Number one, it wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

266
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,836
Number two, you didn't do it. Number
three, you were legally justified...

267
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,108
like the protection of your home
or self-defense.

268
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:55,118
Number four,
the killing was excusable.

269
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,916
Where do I fit in
to this rosy picture?

270
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:02,289
I'll tell you where you don't fit in.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

271
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,296
Why? Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

272
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,059
Time element.

273
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,498
If you'd caught him in the act, the
shooting might have been justified...

274
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,571
but you didn't catch him in the act,
and you had time to bring the police...

275
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,333
and you didn't do that either.

276
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,341
You're guilty of murder...
premeditated and with vengeance.

277
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,638
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

278
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,307
- Are you telling me to plead guilty?
- When I advise a cop out, you'll know.

279
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,078
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

280
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,586
If you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me to do?

281
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,589
I'm not telling you to do anything.

282
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,785
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

283
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,191
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

284
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,164
Whatever it is you're getting at.

285
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,773
You know, you're very bright,
Lieutenant.

286
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:57,440
Now let's see how really bright
you can be.

287
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,815
Well, I'm working at it.

288
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,189
All right.
Now, because your wife was raped...

289
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,692
you'll have a favorable atmosphere
in the courtroom.

290
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,593
The sympathy will be with you
if all the facts are true.

291
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,896
What you need is a legal peg so the jury
can hang their sympathy in your behalf.

292
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,902
You follow me?

293
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,837
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

294
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,345
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

295
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,713
Not justification?

296
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,252
Not justification.

297
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,890
Excuse.

298
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,028
Just excuse.

299
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,513
What excuses are there?

300
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,276
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

301
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,217
- I must've been mad.
- How's that?

302
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,956
I said I must've been mad.

303
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,723
No, bad temper's no excuse.

304
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,867
I mean,
I must've been crazy.

305
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,940
Am I getting warmer?

306
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,514
Okay. See you around.

307
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,381
Am I getting warmer?

308
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,421
I'll tell you that
after I talk to your wife.

309
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,254
In the meantime, see if you can
remember just how crazy you were.

310
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,559
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?

311
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,864
She's been waiting quite a while.

312
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,168
She's been through all your albums,
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

313
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,902
What do you think of her?

314
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,741
Soft. Easy. The kind men like
to take advantage of...

315
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,576
and do.

316
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,616
Did you get any money?

317
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,810
- Money.
- Oh. Oh, no.

318
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,048
I haven't decided
to take the case yet.

319
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,647
You know, you surprise me sometimes.

320
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,660
Why? I've been around.

321
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,076
I, uh...

322
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,747
hope you don't mind.

323
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,646
I think we'd better talk.

324
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,014
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.

325
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,487
The music, I mean.

326
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,557
Aren't lawyers supposed
to like music?

327
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,217
Well, not that kind of music.

328
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,127
Oh. I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of lawyer.

329
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,062
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?

330
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,794
Where did you go to school?
Where did you live when you were young?

331
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,167
No place in particular.
We sort of moved around.

332
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,605
My father was a construction boomer.
Building dams, mostly.

333
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,310
You can call me Laura.

334
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,646
Is your family still alive, Laura?

335
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,079
No.

336
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,447
I don't know. I have
some cigarettes around here someplace.

337
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,713
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, I want to offer you one.

338
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,221
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

339
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,958
Here.

340
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,154
That's just like your husband's.

341
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,127
He gave me this because I liked
the one he had.

342
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,897
He's like that.
He gives me presents all the time.

343
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,734
Do you have a happy marriage?

344
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,207
What went wrong
with the first marriage?

345
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,440
Well, what when wrong is
when I went for Manny.

346
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,517
Well, that's honest enough.

347
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:56,314
It was more than just that. Like I said,
I grew up on the move, and...

348
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,982
Jack... that was my first husband...
Jack didn't like to move.

349
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,355
He wouldn't even take a transfer
when he had the chance.

350
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,428
I was really bored.

351
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,090
Manny likes to go. We're always going
whenever we get the chance.

352
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,225
We've been all over.
I'm thirsty.

353
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,395
Water, or would a beer do?

354
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,167
I think a beer would do fine.

355
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,469
Maida, bring me
a bottle of beer, will you?

356
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,809
- Are you married?
- No.

357
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,313
That's nice.

358
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,216
What do you do alone in this house
if you aren't married?

359
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,051
Well, it's a family home,
and I'm the last of the family.

360
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,057
- There you are.
- Thank you.

361
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,994
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.

362
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,664
There you are.

363
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,894
Could Muff have a little
in that ashtray? He loves beer.

364
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,631
You want a beer for the dog?

365
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,707
Well, here we are.

366
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,014
He'll go to sleep now.

367
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,786
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

368
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,855
How about it?
Are you ready?

369
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,922
I mean, are you ready
to tell me the story?

370
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,928
I know what you mean.

371
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,629
Now, suppose you tell me everything
you told the state police...

372
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,670
plus everything you didn't tell
the state police.

373
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,007
- Where should I begin?
- When did you leave for Quill's bar?

374
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,568
Right after dinner.
About 8:30, I guess.

375
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,012
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range...

376
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,880
so we had dinner,
he laid down and went to sleep.

377
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,783
I hadn't been out of the trailer
all day, so...

378
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,584
I took Muff and a flashlight
and walked over to the bar.

379
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,524
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

380
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,119
- Many people in the bar?
- Mm-mm. Not many.

381
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,825
Barney came over
and challenged me to a game.

382
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:52,096
- For drinks, you know?
- How well did you know Barney?

383
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,866
Well, he owned this bar where
Manny and I went sometimes, that's all.

384
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,942
Had he ever made a pass at you?

385
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,341
No. Nothing like that at all.

386
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,039
Was he drinking heavily that night?

387
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,949
Didn't seem to be. At least
not when we were playing pinball.

388
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,816
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

389
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,980
No, there were other people
playing too.

390
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,581
And what time did you leave the bar?

391
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,094
Oh, about 11:00, I guess.

392
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,393
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

393
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,524
He carries it in his mouth.
He's so cute...

394
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,330
running along ahead
with the light shining.

395
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,429
- Was he sober?
- Muff? Of course he was sober.

396
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,235
Oh, you're joking now,
aren't you?

397
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,606
Yes, I'm joking.
Go on.

398
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,237
Well, Barney came from somewhere.

399
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,110
Not the door I left by.

400
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,014
And he said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

401
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,055
He said the bears had been prowling
around, and I oughtn't to walk home.

402
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,454
The bears come out of the woods
at night to scavenge.

403
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,527
They're harmless enough,
aren't they?

404
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,187
Yeah, I suppose I wouldn't have been
afraid in the daylight...

405
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,492
but the dark isn't the same.

406
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,591
Yes, I know. I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car...

407
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,000
I got in and he drove
straight to the trailer park.

408
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,199
- He made overtures?
- No, nothing.

409
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,300
When we got to the trailer park,
the auto gate was closed.

410
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,040
Mr. Lemon closes it
about 11:00 or a little after.

411
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,708
So I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

412
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,650
but he said that there wasn't
any need for me to walk...

413
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,552
that he could drive me into the park
on another road.

414
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,817
I didn't know
there was another road, but...

415
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,758
he drove on before
I could say yes or no.

416
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,422
- Were you alarmed?
- No.

417
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,556
I'm not usually afraid of men.

418
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,227
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

419
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:36,068
Well, doesn't a woman sort of
instinctively know...

420
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,732
when a fellow's on the make?

421
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,811
Oh, sure,
but that's only usual with me.

422
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,370
With men, I mean. Almost all men.
Ever since I was a kid.

423
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,916
You, for instance.
You're interested...

424
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,918
but there's no reason
to be afraid of you.

425
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,045
It was like that with Barney.

426
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,317
Well, Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least...

427
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,619
Call me Laura.

428
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,997
Laura, I'm only interested
in helping your husband. Nothing more.

429
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,568
I don't mean you'd try anything.

430
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,435
I just mean it's...
it's the way you look at me.

431
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,440
It would be very difficult
not to look at you.

432
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,342
Oh, the way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

433
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,210
Oh, I love it.
I just love it.

434
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,377
Now, we'd better keep moving along
with this thing.

435
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,446
Now, how were you dressed that night?

436
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,288
Oh, in a sweater like this
and a skirt.

437
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,828
And the rest... what about that?

438
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,230
Underneath? I had on a slip
and panties and a bra.

439
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,064
- No girdle?
- I don't need a girdle.

440
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,035
Do you think I do?

441
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,203
I don't know. I don't know.
How should l...

442
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,746
Look, I'm only concerned
with a few facts...

443
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,042
that might be of help to me
in the defense of your husband.

444
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,743
- That's all.
- Well, I don't wear one.

445
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,446
Okay. No girdle. Okay.

446
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,851
All right. Go on.

447
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,687
Well, he turned off the highway
into a lane in the woods...

448
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,057
and he stopped the car
and turned off the lights.

449
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,790
And then he grabbed me,
and he said...

450
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,128
"I'm going to rape you,"
just like that.

451
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,203
- Did he use those words?
- Exactly those words.

452
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,737
Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

453
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,297
I could hear little Muffy whining
outside the car all through it.

454
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,936
And Barney began to try
to get at me...

455
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,209
and I fought him off as best I could,
but he was terribly strong.

456
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,614
Did you cry out?
Did you scream?

457
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,415
Didn't seem to be much use
out there in the woods.

458
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,955
He began to shout names at me, like...

459
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,389
"Army slut" and other names.

460
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,053
And then he drew back
and hit me with his fist.

461
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,892
He hit me again,
and I didn't fight anymore.

462
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,833
I must have been only
half-conscious, but...

463
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,633
I know that he tore my panties off
and did what he wanted.

464
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,834
Now, the newspaper said
that a doctor examined you...

465
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,911
and said that he didn't think
you'd been raped.

466
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,778
I don't care what the doctor thought.
A woman doesn't mistake these things.

467
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,874
All right. All right.
Now, go ahead.

468
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,216
Well, l...

469
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,348
I don't know exactly what happened then.
I must've fainted. But...

470
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,653
the next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

471
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,559
Barney was driving very fast...

472
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,791
and he was breathing hard...

473
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,335
an ugly, gasping sound.

474
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,927
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

475
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,837
and he swung in by the gate
and stopped.

476
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,311
I opened the door to get out. Muffy
jumped out first with a flashlight.

477
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,937
Now, wait a minute.

478
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,983
I thought you said he'd thrown Muff
out of the car back in the woods.

479
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,518
Well, he did, but Muff was in the car
when we got back.

480
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,645
He must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

481
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,247
All right. You opened the door,
and Muff got out first. All right.

482
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,156
Before I could get out...

483
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,627
Barney grabbed me and said he was gonna
tear all my clothes off...

484
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,322
and attacked me again.

485
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,765
I got away and ran. I could see Muff
through an opening in the fence.

486
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,996
He was scooting back and forth
with a flashlight.

487
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:58,269
Barney caught me from behind,
and I fell to the ground.

488
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,209
He fell on top of me and began
to beat me again with his fists.

489
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,143
I thought he was going to kill me.

490
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:07,843
I screamed and somehow got
to my feet again and ran.

491
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,852
I went through the opening
in the fence...

492
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,980
and followed Muffy, who was running
along ahead with the flashlight.

493
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,026
And I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

494
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,186
And you didn't see Barney again?

495
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,787
Never laid eyes on him again,
dead or alive.

496
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,930
Well, I, uh...

497
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,060
I think that's enough for now.

498
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,367
I've got lots of time.
All you want.

499
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,307
- Where can I reach you?
- I'm still in Thunder Bay...

500
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,572
but I can drive down again
in the morning.

501
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,278
- Was there something else?
- No.

502
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,896
- Thanks for letting me play the records.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

503
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,902
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

504
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,876
- Who's that?
- The lady in the case.

505
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,339
- You're not going to take the case?
- I don't know.

506
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,419
That depends on what Manion
has to tell me tomorrow.

507
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,954
He's thinking things out.

508
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,115
Oh, well, that's more like it.

509
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,217
Now, if I take the case,
I want you in it.

510
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,728
Me, in a big murder case?

511
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:32,432
The sight of this whisky-drinking man
at the lawyer's table would ruin you.

512
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,669
I need you.

513
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,240
You mean that?

514
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,366
Why else would he say it?

515
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,939
I'd be glad to work with you
outside of the courtroom, but...

516
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,915
- not in the courtroom.
- Suit yourself about that.

517
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,953
Either way, I'm gonna have
to be able to depend on you.

518
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,889
Will you lay off the booze?

519
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,557
I don't know.

520
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,657
I don't know about that, Paulie.

521
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,793
Why don't you know?

522
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,901
Do you think I couldn't
lay off the booze?

523
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,909
Ever tried it?

524
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,776
Try it.

525
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,151
I never been on
a big murder case.

526
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,884
Not once in all my life.

527
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,222
It's up to you, Parn.

528
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,368
Will you be around tonight?

529
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,769
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be around.

530
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,543
You know, Maida, darling...

531
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,587
I might manage it.

532
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,521
I might manage to be
a real lawyer again.

533
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,793
For a little while, anyway.

534
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,596
I tried remembering.

535
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,466
There were still some pieces missing.

536
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,802
I remember...

537
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,275
going to Quill's bar with a gun...

538
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,745
and I remember Quill's face
behind the bar...

539
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:28,281
but I don't remember anything else,
not even going home.

540
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,720
Don't you remember firing the gun? Five
shots, that's a lot of noise to forget.

541
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:36,657
Yeah, I remember hearing shots,
but they don't seem connected with me.

542
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:41,789
They seemed far away, like
somebody else was doing the shooting.

543
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:50,637
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.

544
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,005
Oh, thanks.
Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

545
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,273
All right. Now, there's
the little matter of the fee.

546
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,507
Three thousand dollars.
That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

547
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,211
Oh, sure. More than reasonable. I'll
have to pay later. Right now I'm broke.

548
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,914
- You're what?
- I'm broke. I'm flat busted.

549
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,013
I don't have three dollars,
much less 3,000.

550
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:11,220
- Can you raise it?
- Oh, yes, as soon as I get out of jail.

551
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,594
But next week's payday.

552
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,497
I'll be able to give you $150...

553
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,366
and if you get me off, I'll give you
a promissory note for the rest.

554
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:24,237
All right, now suppose I don't go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee?

555
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,407
Well, I'll have to take a lawyer
the court appoints.

556
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,209
I got my defense now, right?
Insanity.

557
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,012
I think I'll stick around,
make damn sure you get off.

558
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,213
- Where do we start?
- We're going to need a psychiatrist.

559
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,889
Neither of us has any money. Do you
think the army'll stir one up for you?

560
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,327
I know a colonel in the Pentagon.
I'll write a letter.

561
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,988
Good. Do that. Sulo.

562
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,432
Where are you going now?

563
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,939
I'm going to see your wife,
for one thing.

564
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,135
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

565
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,212
That's right. I did.

566
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,474
She's a very pretty woman,
your wife.

567
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,650
A man gets used to
the way his wife looks.

568
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,482
I guess he does.
I'll see you.

569
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,304
Come on in, Paulie.
Come on in.

570
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,206
You haven't been in here
since you vacated, have you?

571
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,745
Hardly recognize the old place, huh?

572
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,508
Mary did it for me. She just finished
her decorators' course.

573
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,811
Smart girl. Very smart girl.
Look at this.

574
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,614
- A real, genuine Picasso print.
- That's very nice.

575
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,918
And here. Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

576
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,582
Sit right down.

577
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,621
Great, isn't it?
Good for the nerves, they say.

578
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,062
- How do you shut it off?
- Here.

579
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,157
Here we are. Feel better?

580
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,168
I feel all shook up.

581
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,570
Mitch, I just dropped in to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

582
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,803
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

583
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,107
That's a mistake.
It's open and shut.

584
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,806
Well, maybe. We'll see.

585
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,111
Judge Maitland's still in the hospital.
Maybe you'd like to agree...

586
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,243
to a continuance
until he gets back.

587
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,322
If we go with the case now,
we'll have to try before...

588
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,652
some grab-bag judge they'll send in.

589
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,124
- Me, I'd rather have Maitland.
- So would I.

590
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,287
But that'd also mean my client
would lie around in jail...

591
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,797
for another two, three months
before the trial.

592
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,528
Now, if you'll drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

593
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,332
so I can get him out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

594
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,907
You wouldn't do that
if you were still D.A.

595
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,374
I don't know. I might.

596
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,345
I might, since a big, fat
lie detector test on his wife...

597
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,813
is giving proof to the rape story.

598
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,248
- He'd have the jury with him.
- How did you know what the lie...

599
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,216
- I bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

600
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,950
Anyway, the result of a lie detector
test isn't admissible evidence.

601
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,550
- You can't use it.
- No, but it carries moral weight.

602
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,223
Mitch, I wouldn't sit
in that chair too much.

603
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,425
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.

604
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,525
I'll see you later.

605
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,546
He remembers you, Paul.
He likes you.

606
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,740
He likes the beer in my icebox.

607
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,044
What's the occasion today.
A buffalo hunt?

608
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,087
I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

609
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,213
Aren't they smart?
I think they're very smart.

610
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,382
Here, we can sit in my car.

611
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,296
Here you are.

612
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,169
Here you go, Muff.

613
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,466
Several things have occurred to me.

614
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,666
The, uh...

615
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,211
The undergarments
Barney Quill tore off...

616
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,678
Who has them now?
The police?

617
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,749
You mean my panties?

618
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,909
All right. Your panties.

619
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,850
I haven't seen them since.

620
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,684
I gave the torn skirt and sweater
to the police, and then...

621
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,418
I went with them up that lane into
the woods to look for the panties...

622
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,154
but we couldn't find anything
but my glasses.

623
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,823
Your glasses? You mean you were
wearing glasses through all that?

624
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,663
No, I had them
in a case in my hand.

625
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,567
I wear them for reading,
playing pinball, things like that.

626
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,106
I must have tried to get
out of the car and dropped them.

627
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,407
You might be interested to know...

628
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,970
that your lie detector test
turned out in your favor.

629
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,710
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

630
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,787
- You weren't worried about it?
- No.

631
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,118
Why should I be?

632
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,660
Would you like to have something
to worry about?

633
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,022
Silly.

634
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,358
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

635
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,066
All right.

636
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,968
All right, let's have it.

637
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,201
- Did he say something to you?
- Just enough.

638
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,209
Are you afraid of him?

639
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,906
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie detector test? For him?

640
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:04,312
Does he have reason to be jealous?

641
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,413
He was jealous
even before we were married.

642
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,993
I should've known how it would be.

643
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,961
It's funny, though.
He likes to show me off.

644
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,293
He likes me to dress
the way I do.

645
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,960
And then he gets furious
if a man pays any attention to me.

646
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,230
I've tried to leave him,
but I can't.

647
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,602
He begs, I give in.

648
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,269
Now, if you think I've forgotten
my question, I haven't.

649
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,348
- I have.
- All right.

650
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:33,746
Then I'll ask it again.

651
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,911
Does your husband have
any reason to be jealous?

652
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,013
No.

653
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,592
Not once. Not ever.

654
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,965
Hi. Like the place all right?

655
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,433
I was just looking
at these pictures.

656
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,028
- That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.

657
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,573
- I'm Paul Biegler. I'm...
- I know who you are.

658
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,768
I've seen you around Iron City.

659
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,742
You didn't tell me your name.

660
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,246
Paquette.
We don't open till 5:00.

661
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,872
That's all right.
I can wait.

662
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,611
I don't have the shakes yet.

663
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,314
You were on the job that night,
weren't you...

664
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,447
the night Barney Quill was killed.

665
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,856
Like the newspaper said,
I was present.

666
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,361
You were the fellow who stopped
Lt. Manion outside.

667
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,364
That's right.

668
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,594
He pointed the gun at me and said,
"You want some too, buster?"

669
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:42,103
And you said no,
because your name isn't buster.

670
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:46,734
- Wasn't anything funny about it.
- No, there wasn't. I'm sorry.

671
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:50,302
Where were you when Barney Quill
was killed, Mr. Paquette?

672
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,112
I gather you don't want
to talk about that night, huh?

673
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,450
That's right.
I don't want to talk about it.

674
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,991
You'll have to talk to me
about it in court. Why not now?

675
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,959
'Cause I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

676
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,087
Okay.

677
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,958
Boy, old Barney, he was kind of
a rugged character, wasn't he?

678
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:16,301
Ex-prizefighter, muscle man,
fancy with guns, and...

679
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,738
He paid his debts.
Ran a clean place.

680
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,538
- Me, I liked him.
- You run the place now?

681
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:25,342
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

682
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,679
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?

683
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,811
No, he didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

684
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,857
Oh. All right.
I wonder who's gonna inherit the place?

685
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,394
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again.

686
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,395
What's the matter with that?

687
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,523
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know what's the matter with her.

688
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,727
Mary what?

689
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,497
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

690
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,631
She's in the back booth.
We don't talk about our customers here.

691
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,176
But if we did...
which we don't...

692
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,277
That's her.
That's Mary Pilant.

693
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:11,892
- Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?
- Sure. I know the lieutenant too.

694
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,862
He's a good officer.
She's all right too.

695
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,229
Friendly. Good kid.

696
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,268
What do you know about it?
Knock it off.

697
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,270
I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.
What's the matter with that?

698
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:25,398
Do you want this lawyer
to get wrong ideas?

699
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,103
What chance has the lieutenant got,
Mr. McCarthy?

700
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:33,309
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

701
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,545
I'd like to help him out. I sure would.
But we're moving out.

702
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,712
The whole outfit. Berlin.

703
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:44,118
Tell me, who is this babe
at the hotel?

704
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:48,528
Name's Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

705
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,037
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

706
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,921
- Will you be alone?
- I'll be joined by two others.

707
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:17,391
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.

708
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,663
- How was the manicure?
- Ask me any questions about anybody.

709
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:33,072
- I've got all the dope.
- Can you tell me about Mary Pilant?

710
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:37,010
Easy. Mary Pilant may
or may not have been...

711
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,309
the mistress of the late B. Quill.

712
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,907
The manicurist is in favor
of the mistress theory...

713
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,987
but the hairdresser's against it.

714
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,717
However, they both agree that some sort
of hanky-panky must have been going on.

715
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,986
- To be continued.
- Menu?

716
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,823
Thank you.

717
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,896
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty.

718
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,865
What? What?

719
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,335
Anyway, there's one story
that says that...

720
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,407
Barney's wild night with Mrs. Manion
was somehow...

721
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,499
triggered by Mary Pilant.

722
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,478
Seems she'd been running around with
some soldier, and Barney blew his stack.

723
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,981
- He got tanked up and exploded.
- Is Mary Pilant local?

724
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,416
No, she's a Canadian.
Barney brought her in here...

725
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,149
to sort of dress up the place,
and she stayed on to manage it for him.

726
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,851
- Looks like she's done all right.
- Better than all right.

727
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,690
- She's in for the estate.
- Oh?

728
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,196
She doesn't look like a bad sort,
does she?

729
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,357
Hmm? Where?

730
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,766
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.

731
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,497
This girl right here?

732
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,803
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

733
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:46,144
I'm Paul Biegler,
attorney for Lt. Manion...

734
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,581
and this is Miss Rutledge
and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.

735
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,415
- How do you do.
- Could you sit with us for a minute?

736
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,546
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

737
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:59,191
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

738
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,491
What sort of things,
Mr. Biegler?

739
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,261
Well, like what kind of a man
your employer was, Mr. Quill.

740
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,202
- A very nice man.
- If that's true, how do you explain...

741
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,569
what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?

742
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,575
I don't know what happened
with Lt. Manion's wife...

743
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,145
so there really isn't anything
for me to explain, is there?

744
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,682
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching, Miss Pilant.

745
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,377
Barney was well liked here
by everyone, Mr. Biegler.

746
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,511
It's very generous of everyone
to overlook his faults...

747
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,919
like raping other men's wives.

748
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,225
If you'll pardon me.

749
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,887
The waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

750
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,055
Nice to have met you,
Mr. Biegler...

751
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,395
Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

752
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,533
You just drew gin, Lieutenant.

753
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,008
- Twenty.
- Manion?

754
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,008
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah.

755
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,812
This, from Washington.

756
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,717
They'll let a doctor come and testify,
but there's a string on it.

757
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:02,918
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

758
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:06,792
Doesn't the army understand that you're
in jail on a non-bailable offense?

759
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,865
That's it, as far as
the army's concerned.

760
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,729
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try and think of something.

761
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,168
Look, my wife hasn't been here
in two days. Have you seen her?

762
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:18,503
- No, not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?

763
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,542
You've got other things
to worry about, Lieutenant.

764
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,340
I'll get in touch with your wife.
I'll tell her you miss her.

765
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,347
Yeah, you tell her that.

766
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,276
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Paulie.

767
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,489
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

768
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,323
I'd be tearing my hair out too
if I had something like that outside.

769
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,231
Something like what outside?

770
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:47,861
You know what I mean. Something like
that running around on the loose.

771
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,475
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?

772
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,812
It's me, dummy. I hit my elbow
on this lousy iron bar.

773
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:05,786
You want some rubbing alcohol maybe?

774
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,982
A little bourbon might help.

775
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,560
Knock it off, buckos.

776
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,686
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

777
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,091
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got.

778
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,462
Hiya, Paulie. That's what
they call you, isn't it? Paulie?

779
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,536
That's a crazy name
for a crazy lawyer.

780
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,775
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- Hey, you're not splitting the scene?

781
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,181
- I mean, you're not cuttin' out?
- No, I'll be back.

782
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,206
Hi, Paulie.
Fellows, this is Manny's lawyer.

783
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,776
- Hi. How are you?
- Sit down, won't you?

784
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,243
I'm sorry, I can't right now.
Mrs. Manion...

785
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,576
may I talk to you
for a moment outside?

786
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:42,277
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped
the formalities a long time ago.

787
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,218
I think maybe we'd better pick 'em
up again. It's important.

788
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,654
- All right. I'll go with you.
- All right. Come on.

789
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,952
Hey. You're coming back,
aren't you?

790
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,960
What do you think?

791
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,534
See you later, Pie-Eye.

792
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,107
Okay.

793
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:16,245
- Did you get my phone message?
- Yeah, but I got busy.

794
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,378
Why haven't you been
to see your husband?

795
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,388
I don't see why I have
to see him every day.

796
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,685
I think it would be
a very good idea if you did.

797
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,158
All right, I'll see him every day.
Okay?

798
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,254
- No, not okay. Where's your car?
- I came with them.

799
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,425
- Mine's right over here. Come on.
- Wait. I've got friends inside.

800
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,970
- Friends or not, you're going home.
- Who do you think you are?

801
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,733
I'm the lawyer trying to beat a rap
for your husband, remember?

802
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,969
- What's that got to do with...
- You listen to me.

803
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,739
Until this trial's over, you're
going to be a meek little housewife...

804
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,747
with horn-rimmed spectacles...

805
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,477
and you're going to stay away
from men and juke joints...

806
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,883
and booze and pinball machines...

807
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:54,946
and you're going to wear a skirt
and low-heeled shoes and a girdle.

808
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,390
And especially a girdle.
Look, Laura...

809
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,327
believe me, I don't usually
complain of an attractive jiggle...

810
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,524
but you save that jiggle
for your husband to look at...

811
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,294
if and when
I get him out of jail.

812
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,302
Come on. Let's go.

813
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:12,735
I'm sorry. I really am. I wouldn't
hurt Manny's chances for anything.

814
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,742
Come on.

815
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,209
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

816
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,548
Yeah, right over here.

817
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:59,815
Over there's the opening in the fence
where Muffy was running...

818
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,187
back and forth with the flashlight.

819
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,087
Where's your trailer?

820
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,097
Up there on the hill.

821
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,806
This is my favorite place.

822
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:26,274
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping
I'd come out here and just sit.

823
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,479
I had to get out of that trailer.
I couldn't stand being cooped up.

824
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:37,722
I'm... I'm lonely, Paul.
I'm awful lonely.

825
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,558
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that, you know.

826
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:45,532
Maybe you were getting in
some good practice being lonely.

827
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,035
You mean you think maybe
Manny won't get off?

828
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,164
That'll be up to the jury,
and you can never tell about them.

829
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,300
If he didn't,
it'd be one way to end it.

830
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,606
No, I don't mean that.

831
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:00,171
I may think it sometimes,
but I don't really want it.

832
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,832
Hello, sweetie.
Did you miss me?

833
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,163
Of course you missed me.

834
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,868
You wanna come in, Paul?

835
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,407
You can if you want to,
you know.

836
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,942
No thank you, Laura.

837
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,413
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun
over at that place.

838
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,147
Good night, Laura.

839
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,811
Good night.

840
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,710
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

841
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,812
The circuit court for the county
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

842
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,823
You can be seated.

843
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,157
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

844
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,896
I'm from downstate,
and I'm sitting temporarily...

845
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,338
while your good Judge Maitland
is recovering from a severe illness.

846
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:35,536
There's no need to dwell
at length upon my methods.

847
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,443
One judge is quite like another.

848
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:42,279
The only difference is maybe
in the state of their digestions...

849
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,786
or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

850
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,222
For myself,
I can digest pig iron.

851
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,657
And while I might appear
to doze occasionally...

852
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,321
you'll find that
I'm easily awakened...

853
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,866
particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer...

854
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,628
with a nice point of law.

855
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:04,001
We will now take up
the criminal docket.

856
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:08,203
Case number one...
The People v. Clarence Madigan...

857
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:11,246
breaking and entering
in the nighttime.

858
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,248
Will the defendant rise
and come forward?

859
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,250
That's me, Your Honor.

860
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,820
State of Michigan,
court of Iron Cliffs...

861
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,798
I, Mitchell Lodwick, prosecuting
attorney, come into Iron Cliffs...

862
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,926
and give the court to understand
that one Clarence Madigan...

863
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,529
alias "One-Shot" Madigan,
alias "Smoky" Madigan...

864
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,938
did break and enter the dwelling house
of Casper Katz...

865
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:42,876
and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises.

866
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,747
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

867
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:50,683
No. A man's gotta have money to ask
them fellas the time of day.

868
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,687
Mr. Madigan,
if you're impoverished...

869
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,917
it's my duty to appoint an attorney
on your behalf.

870
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,084
I wouldn't bother, Your Honor.

871
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:01,493
I stole the whisky.
I'm guilty as hell.

872
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,964
It was a full case of
expensive bourbon, Your Honor.

873
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,762
Did you sell this whisky?

874
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,358
No. I drank it.

875
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,870
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

876
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,533
Are you aware that it will be
necessary to punish you for this crime?

877
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,610
It was worth it.

878
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,646
Well, I'll accept your plea
of guilty, Mr. Madigan.

879
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,375
You'll be sentenced later.
You may now return to your place.

880
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,383
Thanks, Your Honor.

881
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,588
Case number two...

882
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,089
The People v. Frederick Manion.

883
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,387
The charge... murder.

884
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:36,124
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

885
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,723
Which of these men
is your client, Mr. Biegler?

886
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,393
None of them.

887
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,802
Sheriff, will you produce
the prisoner?

888
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:47,808
Well, l... I'm afraid
I can't do that, Your Honor.

889
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,879
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

890
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,212
The defendant is in Detroit
being examined by a psychiatrist.

891
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,377
Shouldn't the court
have been consulted...

892
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,320
before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

893
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,449
Your Honor, we're dealing
with the army in this matter.

894
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,687
This is the only crack they would
give us at one of their psychiatrists.

895
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:11,495
The court was not present. It was urgent
we get the defendant to a psychiatrist.

896
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,899
What does the attorney for the people
say to this?

897
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,732
It was done with my knowledge.

898
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,775
I've always heard this Upper Pennisula
of our fair state was a queer place.

899
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:24,677
If it's customary here to allow a man
charged with first degree murder...

900
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:29,616
to wander about at will, I don't suppose
it behooves an outsider to point out...

901
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,746
that the law makes no provision
for such quaint liberalism.

902
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:38,555
The defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon.

903
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:42,256
We'll formally arraign the defendant
on his return.

904
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,857
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue to his plea?

905
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,165
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

906
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,706
A plea of "not guilty"
will be entered.

907
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:56,507
The case of Frederick Manion will be
placed first on the trial docket.

908
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,757
Can you hurry it up, Paulie?
If somebody tells that judge...

909
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:13,625
the prisoner was lounging around the
rail station, he'll give me the works.

910
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,631
This will just take a minute.
Come on over here.

911
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,099
Well, Lieutenant,
how'd things turn out?

912
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,674
- I was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?

913
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,835
Yeah. Says he's gonna
write you a letter.

914
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,880
I took some notes on my own.

915
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,972
The doctor's name is Smith.

916
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:38,042
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

917
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,486
A name like that
would impress the jury.

918
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:44,026
Just plain Matthew Smith.
He said that when I shot Quill...

919
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,994
I was suffering from
"dissociative reaction."

920
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,258
- Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
- What does it mean?

921
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:56,862
It means "I had an irresistible
impulse to shoot Quill."

922
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,466
That's okay, isn't it?

923
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:05,843
What did he say about your knowing
the difference between right and wrong?

924
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,543
I don't think he said anything.
Why, is that important?

925
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,883
We'd better not keep
the sheriff waiting. You'd better go.

926
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,661
Thank you, Sheriff.

927
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:36,375
Ever heard of a Michigan court accepting
"irresistible impulse" as insanity?

928
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,573
No. Maybe we'd better
switch to self-defense.

929
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:42,742
Even Mitch Lodwick would make
a monkey out of us then.

930
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,946
- Damn strawberry soda.
- Want a peanut?

931
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,818
No thanks.

932
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,222
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

933
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:54,490
We just have a weekend before the trial.
When do you want to start working?

934
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,827
Tomorrow morning, early.

935
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,789
- Paulie.
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

936
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,054
Never mind that.
Just find...

937
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,393
People v. Durfee, 62,
Michigan, 486, Year 1886.

938
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:06,900
That's it. I have it right here
in the A.L.R. Listen.

939
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:10,029
"The right and wrong test,
though deemed unscientific...

940
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,039
is adhered to by most states but..."

941
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,235
Now listen to this "but"...
"but the fact that one accused...

942
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:18,472
of committing a crime
may have been able to comprehend...

943
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,379
the nature and the consequences
of this act...

944
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,918
and to know that it was wrong.

945
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,786
- Nevertheless..."
- Sweet enduring word "Nevertheless."

946
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,121
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution...

947
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:36,358
by an impulse... by an impulse
which he was powerless to control...

948
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,059
he will be excused from punishment."

949
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,797
The Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse.

950
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,429
This is precedent.

951
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,031
Boy, I think we've got
a hold of something here.

952
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,611
Good old Durfee, 1886.

953
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,476
How about that?
Give me a pad.

954
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:56,244
This strawberry soda is beginning
to taste like real bourbon whisky.

955
01:05:56,352 --> 01:06:00,049
Well, don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...

956
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:03,216
that our client was
irresistibly impulsed.

957
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,624
Remember that.

958
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:09,994
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
before we proceed further...

959
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:14,035
it will be necessary for me
to examine you on your qualifications...

960
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,195
to sit as jurors.

961
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,796
Will you please remember
that you are under oath?

962
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,308
Are all of you citizens?

963
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,072
Will you please
raise your hand if you are not?

964
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:41,962
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

965
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,055
No.

966
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,896
Are any of you related
by blood or marriage...

967
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,494
to any law enforcement officer?

968
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:55,066
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.

969
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,407
Do any of you have
any business pending...

970
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,107
with the prosecuting attorney,
Mitchell Lodwick?

971
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:05,320
Do any of you have any business pending
with Paul Biegler...

972
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,015
attorney for the defense?

973
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,649
Are any of you acquainted
with the defendant...

974
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,126
sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left?

975
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:18,298
Will Mrs. Laura Manion,
the defendant's wife, please stand?

976
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,669
Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?

977
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,604
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

978
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,075
Counsel may challenge the jury
for cause.

979
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:34,673
Before counsel's challenge, may I
introduce Claude Dancer to the court?

980
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:37,878
Mr. Dancer is an assistant
attorney general from Lansing.

981
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,785
Because of the peculiar nature
of this case...

982
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,621
I requested the attorney general to let
Mr. Dancer sit in with the prosecution.

983
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,594
Your reputation precedes you,
Mr. Dancer.

984
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,664
It's a privilege to have you
in my court.

985
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,791
Thank you.
I'm sure it'll be instructive.

986
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,393
Do any of you have
any business pending...

987
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,904
before the
attorney general's office?

988
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,242
I must apologize for
my disparaging remarks...

989
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:06,109
about the Upper Pennisula
and its customs.

990
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:11,517
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected
and sworn in less than half a day.

991
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,646
You have won my heart
completely, gentlemen.

992
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,056
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

993
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,993
It was a little suggestion
I wanted to make.

994
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,658
- By all means.
- Since the defense plea is insanity...

995
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,099
the prosecution has retained
a psychiatrist.

996
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:30,263
Under the statute, we have a right
to petition for a mental exam...

997
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,363
of the defendant
by our own doctor.

998
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:36,502
- Are you familiar with that statute?
- Uh-huh. Moderately.

999
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,445
I think it would only delay things
to file a formal petition...

1000
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:44,110
so why don't we informally agree
to ask His Honor for an adjournment...

1001
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,849
only a day or so, and our doctor
can visit with the defendant.

1002
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,221
It would save everyone time.
Don't you think so?

1003
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,226
- I'm sure it will.
- Good.

1004
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:56,594
Suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway.

1005
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,795
Of course, you're a little late.
Maybe His Honor will overlook that.

1006
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:05,363
Then I'd like the jury to see that you
think our insanity plea has some merit.

1007
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,602
There really won't be any need
for our doctor to examine your client.

1008
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,611
Naturally, I was only following
the usual procedure.

1009
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,146
Naturally, I'm all for it.

1010
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,376
- Do you wish to file the petition?
- Yes, Your Honor...

1011
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,385
- That won't be necessary.
- That's right.

1012
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:22,583
Skirmish over. Shall we join now
on the field of battle?

1013
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,392
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

1014
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,468
One of the bullets had passed
through the heart.

1015
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:37,005
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

1016
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,233
and was directly caused
by this wound.

1017
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,504
Dr. Raschid, may I have
your detailed report?

1018
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:43,771
Certainly.

1019
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:47,542
I ask that this report be marked
People's Exhibit One for identification.

1020
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,709
So received and marked.

1021
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,912
The people hand the defense
a copy of the report.

1022
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,217
Counsel may cross-examine.

1023
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:59,192
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose
was to ascertain the cause of death.

1024
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,388
- Was it not?
- Yes.

1025
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:04,660
And yet I read in your report here
that you checked to determine...

1026
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:09,295
whether spermatogenesis was occurring
in the body of the deceased.

1027
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,997
Objection.

1028
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:14,439
The people call this witness
only to show the cause of death.

1029
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,171
Your Honor, the entire report
was offered as evidence...

1030
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,248
and the report contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

1031
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,509
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.

1032
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,812
The witness may answer.

1033
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:27,047
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

1034
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,125
And now would you tell
the court your findings.

1035
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,161
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

1036
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:36,925
In other words, the deceased in life
was not sterile.

1037
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,091
- He could produce children.
- That is correct.

1038
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:42,136
Now, Doctor, if a woman says
that she has had intercourse...

1039
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,730
with a certain man
and the man is proved fertile...

1040
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,469
even though no evidence
is found in the woman's body...

1041
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,943
could a lawyer...
say a prosecuting attorney...

1042
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:54,538
could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

1043
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:59,053
Your Honor, I object
to this line of questioning.

1044
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:03,614
We're not concerned with if there has
been relations with a man and a woman.

1045
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:07,321
As long as an examination
for spermatogenesis has been made...

1046
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,420
at least we're entitled
to know why.

1047
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,964
Overruled. You may answer.

1048
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,864
Yes, prosecution could use that...

1049
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,370
though it certainly would not be
conclusive that she was lying.

1050
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,940
Why not?

1051
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,340
There could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative.

1052
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:25,470
The use of a contraceptive...

1053
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:29,347
or possibly there was no completion
on the part of the man.

1054
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,978
Now this postmortem,
were you also asked to determine...

1055
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:36,524
if the deceased had reached a
sexual climax shortly before his death?

1056
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,150
- No, sir.
- Could you have made this determination?

1057
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:40,785
Oh, yes.

1058
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,660
So, you were only asked to make
such an examination...

1059
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:46,633
that might be useful to the prosecution,
none that might help the defense?

1060
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,965
I object, Your Honor.

1061
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,800
The question is argumentative.

1062
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:55,309
Counsel is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the people.

1063
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,608
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1064
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,376
I withdraw the question
and apologize.

1065
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,815
The question and answer
will be stricken...

1066
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:08,083
and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1067
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,418
That's all.

1068
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,322
No redirect.

1069
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:14,590
The people now call
Lloyd Burke.

1070
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,097
Will the witness
step forward, please?

1071
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:25,033
How can a jury disregard
what it's already heard?

1072
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,040
- They can't, Lieutenant.
- Do you solemnly swear...

1073
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,133
the testimony you shall give
shall be the truth...

1074
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:32,508
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1075
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,481
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

1076
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:39,782
- Will you state your profession?
- I'm a commercial photographer.

1077
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,356
Were you called upon
by the police...

1078
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:46,155
to take photographs of the body
of the deceased Bernard Quill...

1079
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,196
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1080
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:50,560
Yes, sir.

1081
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,726
Were these photographs
of the deceased made by you?

1082
01:12:58,173 --> 01:12:59,731
They were.

1083
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:04,677
The recorder will please mark
these People's Exhibit 282-D.

1084
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,341
Photos are tendered to the defense
for examination.

1085
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,317
And the people move their admission
as evidence. Your witness.

1086
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,513
No questions. No objections.

1087
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,954
Paul, he took pictures
of me that night too.

1088
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,526
Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1089
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:26,398
These photos offered as evidence, are
they the only ones you took that night?

1090
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,595
Why, no.

1091
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:30,672
I suppose the others
didn't turn out?

1092
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,503
All my pictures turn out.

1093
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,305
Of course.
I beg your pardon.

1094
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,245
Did you give the other pictures
to the police?

1095
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:40,815
I did.

1096
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,645
What were they?

1097
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:46,050
Were they side shots
or a shot of the moon perhaps...

1098
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,885
or a black bear scavenging
the Thunder Bay dump?

1099
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:52,825
I object. I can't see how
other photographs are relevant.

1100
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:57,831
The photos were introduced to show
the deceased met with a violent death.

1101
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:01,391
I should think any photo pertaining
to the case would be relevant.

1102
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:04,404
The point is good, Mr. Biegler.
Continue.

1103
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:07,236
What were these
other photographs of?

1104
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,735
Lieutenant Manion's wife.

1105
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:14,009
You mean they showed how she looked
after Barney Quill was killed?

1106
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,017
- Yes.
- How she looked is irrelevant.

1107
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,611
There's no evidence to connect
Mrs. Manion's appearance to this murder.

1108
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,883
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry.

1109
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:26,358
I just wanted to make sure prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1110
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,123
Now look here!

1111
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,597
I protest to the defense attorney's
persistent attacks...

1112
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,691
on the motives
of the prosecution.

1113
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:38,569
The jury will disregard the mark
made by the defense attorney.

1114
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,507
There's no reason to believe
that the prosecution...

1115
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,168
has not acted in good faith.

1116
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:46,179
My apologies to the prosecution
and to the court.

1117
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:49,648
But Your Honor,
as long as protests are being made...

1118
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,311
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1119
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:57,688
I'm perfectly willing to take on these
two legal giants anytime, anyplace...

1120
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,626
but in all fairness
it ought to be one at a time.

1121
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,165
I don't want these two fellas pitching
knuckleballs at me at the same time.

1122
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:07,667
It seems to me you're batting
close to a thousand...

1123
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,169
but your point is well taken.

1124
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,866
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

1125
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:17,605
he alone shall continue with that
witness until the witness is excused.

1126
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:20,238
Thank you, Your Honor.
No more questions.

1127
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,146
No questions.

1128
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,391
- My, we're drawing well, aren't we?
- Where's Parnell?

1129
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,522
Parnell? Isn't he here?

1130
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,693
No, he's not here, not in his rooming
house and hasn't been there all night.

1131
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,827
You were the last to see him.
Where is he?

1132
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,931
- I promised not to tell, so don't ask.
- He hasn't fallen off the wagon?

1133
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,636
- No, he was sober.
- Has he gone somewhere?

1134
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,441
He did borrow my car
for something or other.

1135
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,676
Your car? That was smart.
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.

1136
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,877
He'll kill himself.
Now where's he gone?

1137
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,318
My word is my bond.

1138
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,982
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
You may proceed.

1139
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,484
Your Honor...

1140
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:35,216
the defense notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1141
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:38,725
We're wondering if the court shares
our curiosity as to just who he is?

1142
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,727
I was about to introduce him.

1143
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,765
Your Honor, this gentlemen
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1144
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:48,893
Dr. Harcourt is the people's
psychiatrist in this case.

1145
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:53,441
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

1146
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,271
What are you going to
have him observe...

1147
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:58,813
the constellation of Taurus
or the life and times of a bumblebee?

1148
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:01,678
To observe the defendant, of course.

1149
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:05,048
That's fine.
The defense has no objection.

1150
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,246
I just wish to express my relief...

1151
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:12,055
that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1152
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,492
Call Alphonse Paquette.

1153
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:22,767
Raise your right hand.

1154
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:25,704
Do you solemnly swear the testimony
you give in this case...

1155
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:29,334
shall be the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1156
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,344
- I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1157
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:37,409
- Will you state your name?
- Alphonse Paquette.

1158
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:41,717
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn?
- I'm bartender there.

1159
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:45,190
Were you working the night that Barney
Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1160
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,693
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1161
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,024
I was.

1162
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:52,862
Will you tell us in your own words
what happened?

1163
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:56,495
I was at a table by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1164
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,403
Did you know Lt. Manion
by sight and name?

1165
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,408
Go ahead.

1166
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:05,970
Well, he came in and walked
over to the bar and began to shoot.

1167
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,675
He shot Barney when he came
up to the bar...

1168
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:12,652
and when Barney fell he kept on shooting
at Barney behind the bar.

1169
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,654
Then he turned around and walked out.

1170
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:18,988
When Lt. Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1171
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:23,656
Well, he walked slow, kind of deliberate
I guess you could say.

1172
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,858
Did he speak to Barney Quill?

1173
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:29,232
Not a word. Just walked over
and pulled out his gun...

1174
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:30,804
and bang.

1175
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:34,034
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.

1176
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:37,305
When he walked out,
how did he appear to you?

1177
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,903
He seemed just like he did
when he walked in...

1178
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,245
like he was the mailman
delivering the mail.

1179
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,717
When Lt. Manion walked
out of the bar, what did you do?

1180
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:49,086
Well, it happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned.

1181
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,058
- But then I ran out after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1182
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,061
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1183
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:59,122
Yes, sir. I said, " Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1184
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,668
Did he reply to you?

1185
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:05,262
He said,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1186
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,364
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1187
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,276
He was holding the gun in my direction,
but the muzzle was low.

1188
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:15,509
When he said,
"Do you want some too, buster?"...

1189
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,517
how was that expressed?

1190
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,520
Did he shout it?
Was it hysterical?

1191
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,318
Was he hoarse?
Did his voice tremble?

1192
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:27,623
No, sir. He just said it
cool and hard and looked right at me.

1193
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:30,755
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1194
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:34,029
to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

1195
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:37,572
- Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.
- Your witness.

1196
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:42,302
Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion
in the bar that night?

1197
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,641
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1198
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:49,615
I don't see why the prosecution's
so jumpy. I haven't gone anyplace yet.

1199
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:53,586
Let's see where he's going
before we start objecting.

1200
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,747
You may proceed.

1201
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:58,519
Did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1202
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:02,495
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave that night?

1203
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,963
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1204
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,000
I think he came back around midnight.

1205
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:10,663
Now from which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance...

1206
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,366
or come from that outside entrance?

1207
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,670
It was from the lobby.

1208
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:18,575
- And how did he appear to you then?
- How do you mean?

1209
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,945
You understood the prosecution well
when he asked you that question...

1210
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,950
about Lt. Manion's appearance.

1211
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,283
Oh, well, he was just
old Barney, like usual.

1212
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:32,884
You mean he was just good old sober,
reliable, gentle...

1213
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,588
salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney.

1214
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:37,824
Your Honor, what kind
of a question is that?

1215
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,299
I withdraw the question, Your Honor.

1216
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:47,132
Had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1217
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,470
I don't remember.

1218
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,569
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned...

1219
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,274
that is, might he
have changed his clothes?

1220
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,282
I didn't notice.

1221
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,545
Was Barney drinking that night?

1222
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:02,885
Well, he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers.

1223
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:06,449
- He's friendly.
- Oh, sure, he was. Good old Barney.

1224
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:10,327
Now how many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1225
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:11,990
I don't know.

1226
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,796
Wasn't he in fact pretty loaded
that night?

1227
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:17,963
Objection. Even if the deceased
was dead drunk...

1228
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,973
it's no defense to this charge.

1229
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:23,340
Sustained.
I suggest you get off this.

1230
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:29,015
What would you call a man with
an insatiable penchant for women?

1231
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:30,812
A what?

1232
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:34,582
A penchant, a desire,
taste, passion.

1233
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,783
Well, a ladies man, I guess.

1234
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,123
Or maybe just a damn fool.

1235
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,555
Just answer the questions.

1236
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,328
The attorneys will provide
the wisecracks.

1237
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:51,371
Well, what else would you call
a man like that?

1238
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:55,739
- We can't see the drift of this.
- You mean you do see.

1239
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,004
You may answer.

1240
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,512
Can you think of another name?

1241
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:01,309
Woman chaser.

1242
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,010
- Try again.
- Masher?

1243
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:06,053
Oh, come now.

1244
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,590
Mashers went out with whalebone corsets
and hairnets.

1245
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,591
Did you ever hear
the expression "wolf"?

1246
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:14,389
Sure, I heard that.
It just slipped my mind.

1247
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,589
Well, naturally, it would...

1248
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,724
clanking around in there
with all those rusty old "mashers."

1249
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,065
Have you ever known a man
you could call a wolf?

1250
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:26,140
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?

1251
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,799
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't?

1252
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:29,809
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1253
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:33,347
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't tell you.

1254
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:38,408
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had gone...

1255
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,886
- did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:44,152
- And what did he say then?
- He said, "I'll take over."

1257
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:47,695
When you came out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1258
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,560
I went over to the table
where the Pedersons were sitting.

1259
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:54,624
Now you testified that you were
by the door when Lt. Manion came in.

1260
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,705
Is that the reason you were by the door,
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1261
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,239
Yes.

1262
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,936
And how long was it
before Lt. Manion came in?

1263
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:06,138
I don't know exactly.
Maybe 30 minutes.

1264
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,909
And you remained at
the Pedersons' table all that time?

1265
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:13,386
- Yes, they're friends of mine.
- Is there a window beside that table?

1266
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,456
- I think so.
- You think so.

1267
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:18,720
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn?

1268
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,590
About six, seven years.

1269
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:22,856
Does this window beside the table...

1270
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:28,527
suddenly vanish and reappear and
come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1271
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,399
It's there all the time.

1272
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:34,566
While you were talking to your friends
there, did you look out of the window?

1273
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:38,407
- I might have.
- Were you looking for something special?

1274
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,538
No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1275
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:44,607
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go to
that window and look out for Lt. Manion?

1276
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:51,516
Did he tell you to look out
for Lt. Manion?

1277
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:54,686
He did not.

1278
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:58,630
Barney was quite a marksmen,
wasn't he, with guns?

1279
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,963
He won a lot of prizes.

1280
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,168
Did he keep any guns
behind the bar?

1281
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,513
He might have.

1282
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:16,516
Isn't it a fact there are three
concealed pistol racks behind the bar?

1283
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:20,452
The defendant's plea is one of insanity,
not self-defense.

1284
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:24,389
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten
that fact, Mr. Lodwick.

1285
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:25,959
You may answer.

1286
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,359
Are there concealed gun racks
behind the bar?

1287
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:29,691
Yes.

1288
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:32,961
And how many people know
about these gun racks?

1289
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,332
- I couldn't say.
- Isn't it a fact...

1290
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:39,601
that Barney would take the guns out
of the racks and twirl them...

1291
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:43,404
to demonstrate his skill
to the patrons?

1292
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,445
- I don't remember.
- Come on.

1293
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,812
Try and remember.
Did you ever see him do that yourself?

1294
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,284
- Once or twice he did.
- That's all.

1295
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:55,447
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1296
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,787
Call George Lemon.

1297
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,161
Biegler's going off
in all directions.

1298
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,497
What's he getting at?

1299
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,906
I have a feeling he's afraid
of what we'll get at.

1300
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:17,876
Mr. Biegler's putting up
a smoke screen for some reason.

1301
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,709
- I do.
- Take a seat please.

1302
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:25,653
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1303
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:27,653
What kind of work do you do?

1304
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:30,883
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1305
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:33,017
I see the place is clean
and orderly.

1306
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,562
I check people in and out
and lock the gate at night.

1307
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:38,928
And what is your authority
for these duties?

1308
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:42,799
I'm paid by Madison Township
and I'm also a deputy sheriff.

1309
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,337
Just courtesy, sort of.

1310
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,840
Did you see Lt. Manion
on the night of the 15th?

1311
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,809
- The night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1312
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:56,306
Will you tell the court
about how and when...

1313
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,851
you saw Lt. Manion.

1314
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:02,047
About 1:00 a.m. A knock on my door
waked me up.

1315
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,717
I went to the door and Lt. Manion
was standing there.

1316
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:09,627
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1317
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,928
I told him to go back to his trailer
and that I would call the state police.

1318
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:16,902
How did Lt. Manion appear to you
when he asked you to take him?

1319
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,600
He said what he had to say
and did what I told him. No fuss.

1320
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,200
Did he appear to you to be...
as far as you could tell...

1321
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,542
in complete possession
of his faculties?

1322
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:28,775
As far as I could tell,
yes, sir.

1323
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,453
Take the witness.

1324
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:35,921
Mr. Lemon, did you go
to the Manions' trailer?

1325
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,993
- Yes, sir.
- Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?

1326
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:42,585
- Yes, sir.
- What was her appearance?

1327
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,927
She was a mess.

1328
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,261
Objection.

1329
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,565
No evidence has been introduced to make
Mrs. Manion's appearance relevant.

1330
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:54,233
No evidence has been introduced to make
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1331
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,572
but you didn't object
to the question then.

1332
01:26:56,678 --> 01:27:00,114
Is that because you know Barney Quill
bathed and changed...

1333
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,013
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman?

1334
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:06,484
Your Honor, everybody in this court
is being tried except Mr. Manion.

1335
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:11,321
Now listen, this is a cross-examination
murder case, not a high school debate!

1336
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:15,590
What are you trying to do,
railroad this soldier into the clink?

1337
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,927
Mr. Biegler, you are
an experienced attorney...

1338
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,762
and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1339
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,962
I will not tolerate intemperance
of this sort.

1340
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:27,007
If you once again try the patience
of this court...

1341
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:30,544
I shall hold you in contempt.

1342
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,704
Sorry.

1343
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:34,907
Your Honor...

1344
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:38,452
I apologize and
it won't happen again.

1345
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,578
The witness's answer
will be stricken...

1346
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:43,555
and the jury will disregard
the answer.

1347
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:46,422
Now you may proceed,
Mr. Biegler.

1348
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:48,495
Yes, sir.

1349
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:54,094
On the night when Lt. Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1350
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:57,865
had you been awakened before... had
anything else disturbed your slumbers?

1351
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,736
- No, sir.
- There were no soldiers singing?

1352
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,402
No, sir. Not in my park
after 10:00.

1353
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:07,538
- There were no women screaming?
- Those screams were down by the gate.

1354
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,378
Objection!

1355
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:12,385
I see no reason for objecting yet.

1356
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:15,581
Tell us about those screams.

1357
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,182
I didn't hear them myself. There were
tourists from Ohio in the park...

1358
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:21,762
and they heard them
and told me about it the next day.

1359
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:24,764
- Now, Mr. Lodwick.
- This testimony is incompetent...

1360
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:28,927
hearsay, irrelevant,
immaterial, inconclusive...

1361
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:32,871
Well, that's too much for me.
The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick.

1362
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,101
Huh?

1363
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,268
No questions.

1364
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:39,437
The witness may step down.

1365
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:41,947
Call your next witness.

1366
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,478
Detective Sergeant James Durgo.

1367
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:50,015
- Hi, Paulie.
- Hi, Jim. Come here.

1368
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:54,661
As soon as we break, you'd better phone
that army psychiatrist.

1369
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:57,458
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1370
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:00,932
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1371
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,969
Won't do.

1372
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,369
Well, you're fired.

1373
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:08,135
You can't fire me
till you pay me.

1374
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,472
Detective Sergeant James Durgo
of the state police.

1375
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:13,809
Were you called to Thunder Bay by
Deputy Sheriff Lemon of Thunder Bay...

1376
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,849
on the night Barney Quill
was killed?

1377
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,718
Yes, sir. My companion officer and I
were the first to be called in.

1378
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:23,484
When you arrived at the Manion trailer,
who was there?

1379
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,821
Lt. Manion and his wife were there.

1380
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:29,158
What did Lt. Manion say to you?

1381
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:32,528
He said that his wife had had
some trouble with Barney Quill.

1382
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:35,397
He had gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1383
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:38,802
He asked us whether Quill was dead
or not. We told him he was.

1384
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:41,841
How did Lt. Manion
take this information?

1385
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,706
He didn't seem surprised.

1386
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,711
What did you do then?

1387
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,713
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1388
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:51,911
Did you take Lt. Manion to the county
jail here in Iron City that same night?

1389
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,715
Yes, sir. We drove the Lieutenant
down with his wife.

1390
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:59,919
On the drive to Iron City, did Manion
talk further about the shooting?

1391
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:03,588
He remarked that if he had the whole
thing to do over, he'd still do it.

1392
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:07,361
During all this, at the trailer,
the drive to Iron City...

1393
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,368
how did Lt. Manion appear to you?

1394
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:14,163
He was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clearheaded.

1395
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:18,473
Would you say he was in complete
possession of his faculties?

1396
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,173
- Seemed so to me.
- Your witness.

1397
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:25,082
Sergeant Durgo, you testified
that Lt. Manion told you...

1398
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:30,488
he shot Barney Quill after he learned
his wife had some trouble with Quill.

1399
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:34,027
Were these the words Lt. Manion
used, "some trouble"?

1400
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,460
No, sir. Those were my words,
not his.

1401
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:39,556
And was it your notion to come here
and use your own words?

1402
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,328
No, sir.

1403
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,734
And was the suggestion to call it
"some trouble"...

1404
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,773
made by somebody here
in the courtroom?

1405
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:49,702
Yes, sir.

1406
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:55,811
Sergeant, would you tell the court
what words Lt. Manion actually used...

1407
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:58,215
to describe the trouble
his wife had had.

1408
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:00,913
Objection.
We've been over this before.

1409
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:04,150
This information would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1410
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,852
This statement concerning some trouble
was brought out...

1411
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,828
during the direct examination
of Sergeant Durgo.

1412
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,128
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted
all testimony...

1413
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:15,327
as far as Laura Manion's concerned.

1414
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:18,735
All right, the cat's out of the bag.
It's fair game for me to chase it.

1415
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,298
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1416
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,605
I'd like to hear
from the prosecution.

1417
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:29,206
Burden is on defense to prove temporary
insanity at the time of the shooting.

1418
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:33,253
Now, if the reason for the alleged
insanity is important to this case...

1419
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:35,879
then that is a matter
for a competent witness...

1420
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,619
an expert on the subject
of the human mind.

1421
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,389
What the defense is trying to do...

1422
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,193
is introduce
some sensational material...

1423
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:49,133
for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues.

1424
01:31:49,237 --> 01:31:54,038
How can the jury accurately estimate
the testimony being given here...

1425
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:57,599
unless they first know the reason
behind this whole trial...

1426
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,579
why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?

1427
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:04,640
The prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act.

1428
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:09,746
That's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1429
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:14,794
Now the core of our defense is that
the defendant's temporary insanity...

1430
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:18,263
was triggered by the so-called trouble
with Quill.

1431
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,493
And I beg the court...

1432
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:24,901
l... I beg the court
to let me cut into the apple.

1433
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,173
Our objection still stands,
Your Honor.

1434
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,585
Objection overruled.

1435
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:55,765
Sergeant Durgo,
tell the court...

1436
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:59,863
how Lt. Manion described
the trouble his wife had with Quill.

1437
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:03,410
He told us that Quill
had raped his wife.

1438
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:08,505
Now, can you recall generally what
Lt. Manion told you about this rape?

1439
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:12,746
Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleep
right after dinner.

1440
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:16,914
He was waked up by some noise...
screams he thought.

1441
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:21,017
He got up, opened the trailer door
and went outside.

1442
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:24,154
His wife came running out of the dark
and fell into his arms.

1443
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:27,530
As you saw his wife in the trailer,
how did she look?

1444
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:30,729
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1445
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:33,739
She had big black bruises
all over her face and arms.

1446
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:37,004
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

1447
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,978
- She did.
- Did she take you to where it happened?

1448
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:41,548
Yes, the next morning.

1449
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:46,916
Did you find anything there pertaining
to the story Mrs. Manion told you?

1450
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:52,015
On the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks...

1451
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:56,688
and a leather case with
some horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1452
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:59,425
We also looked for...

1453
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:02,593
a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's,
but we didn't find it.

1454
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:05,501
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench?

1455
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:13,578
Mr. Biegler, you've finally got
your rape into the case.

1456
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:17,640
I think all the details should now
be made clear to the jury.

1457
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:21,483
- Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
- Absolutely.

1458
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:25,081
What exactly was the undergarment
just referred to?

1459
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:26,921
Panties, Your Honor.

1460
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:30,464
- Do you expect this to come up again?
- Yes, sir.

1461
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:34,864
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1462
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:37,130
Can we find another name for them?

1463
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:39,968
I never heard my wife
call them anything else.

1464
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:43,237
- Mr. Biegler.
- I'm a bachelor, Your Honor.

1465
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,074
That's a great help.
Mr. Dancer?

1466
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:51,049
I was overseas during the war.
I learned a French word.

1467
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,416
I'm afraid that might be
slightly suggestive.

1468
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,512
Most French words are.

1469
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:58,956
All right, gentlemen,
back to your places.

1470
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,963
For the benefit of the jury, but more
especially for the spectators...

1471
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:07,967
the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1472
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:09,798
Mrs. Manion's panties.

1473
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:17,774
I wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with.

1474
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:22,144
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial.

1475
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:25,844
And when it happens, there will not be
one laugh, one snicker...

1476
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:29,821
one giggle or even one smirk
in my courtroom.

1477
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:33,519
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1478
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:37,119
which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1479
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:41,429
and the possible incarceration
of another.

1480
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,264
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1481
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:45,497
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie detector test?

1482
01:35:45,606 --> 01:35:49,064
Objection. A polygraph test is
inadmissible evidence in our courts.

1483
01:35:49,176 --> 01:35:52,543
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1484
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:54,546
He may answer that.

1485
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:57,674
I gave her a lie detector test
at her request.

1486
01:35:57,785 --> 01:36:01,277
Now after all this investigation,
did you believe Mrs. Manion?

1487
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:03,879
- I did.
- Even after the lie detector test?

1488
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:09,452
That question constitutes flagrant
subterfuge on part of the defense.

1489
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,155
Objection sustained.

1490
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:15,793
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
a polygraph or lie detector test...

1491
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:17,803
is not admissible in evidence...

1492
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,032
because no one
has ever been quite sure...

1493
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:23,907
that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1494
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,638
Go ahead.

1495
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:29,739
In any case, you yourself
in your own heart and mind...

1496
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:32,478
are quite convinced
of Mrs. Manion's honesty?

1497
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:35,146
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1498
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:38,282
Just a moment.

1499
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:46,665
Did you look for the panties elsewhere
other than the lane in the woods?

1500
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:49,998
We looked in Barney Quill's car,
his room in the hotel.

1501
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:51,571
We didn't find them.

1502
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:55,233
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie detector test?

1503
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:57,242
- I know what she said.
- What?

1504
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:01,110
She wanted everyone to believe her story
because she knew it'd help her husband.

1505
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:02,978
Was that the only reason she gave?

1506
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:07,383
Said she swore to her husband. Said she
wanted everyone else to believe it too.

1507
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:09,388
One moment, please.

1508
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:15,721
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1509
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:19,129
Did Mrs. Manion say how
she had sworn to her husband?

1510
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:23,169
Yes, sir. She said
she had sworn on a rosary.

1511
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:28,105
This lane in the woods,
what's it used for, where does it go?

1512
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:31,406
It used to be a logging road.
It doesn't go anyplace, just stops.

1513
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,412
Who uses it now?

1514
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,744
I think it's a road
kids drive down to park.

1515
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,478
- You mean it's a lovers' lane?
- I think so.

1516
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:41,453
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.

1517
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:44,991
- The witness may step down.
- In view of evidence concerning rape...

1518
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:47,253
which Your Honor
has ruled admissible...

1519
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,591
the prosecution asks for
a 30-minute recess...

1520
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,689
in order to bring in another witness
we had not anticipated using?

1521
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,496
All right.
We'll take a 30-minute recess.

1522
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:57,093
Recess.

1523
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,478
Why didn't you tell me
about that rosary?

1524
01:38:07,815 --> 01:38:09,715
I forgot it.

1525
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:14,379
We didn't forget it. Manny said maybe
we shouldn't tell that again.

1526
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:18,390
It might have looked like something
else... like I didn't believe her.

1527
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:24,729
- How much more didn't you tell me?
- We told you everything else.

1528
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:26,857
Is that right, Laura?

1529
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:29,128
Oh, yes, everything else.

1530
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:31,397
Now get this, both of you.

1531
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:35,441
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

1532
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:38,033
I don't want you to tell anything
but the truth.

1533
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:43,014
Don't try and lie or conceal anything
or you get skinned alive.

1534
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:45,347
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1535
01:39:06,307 --> 01:39:09,868
Dr. Dompierre, did you have occasion
to come to the county jail...

1536
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:12,343
on the night of August 15 this year?

1537
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:15,074
- I did.
- Who called you to the jail?

1538
01:39:15,182 --> 01:39:18,583
- The police authorities.
- What did they want you to do?

1539
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:21,655
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1540
01:39:21,755 --> 01:39:24,121
on the person
of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1541
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:28,024
- I made the test.
- What was your conclusion?

1542
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,256
- Negative. There was none.
- Your witness.

1543
01:39:32,733 --> 01:39:37,568
In making these tests, did you notice
any bruises or marks on Mrs. Manion?

1544
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:38,933
I did.

1545
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:41,530
Were you asked to determine
the reason for these bruises?

1546
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:45,578
- I was not.
- Where did you do the lab work?

1547
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,977
St. Margaret's Hospital
in the city.

1548
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:52,143
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- Technician at the hospital.

1549
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:54,311
Wouldn't it have been better...

1550
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:58,414
to have these slides worked up by
a pathologist or expert in this field?

1551
01:39:58,525 --> 01:40:01,517
Yes, but the police
were in a hurry.

1552
01:40:01,628 --> 01:40:04,153
I happened to know this young fella
came on at 7:00 in the morning.

1553
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:07,256
Wouldn't it have been especially better
to wait for the expert...

1554
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,962
if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1555
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:14,268
- It would have been.
- In the newspaper of August 16...

1556
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:17,435
it was stated that you found
no evidence of rape, is that true?

1557
01:40:17,544 --> 01:40:19,910
It is not true.
I made no such statement.

1558
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:23,973
But did you form an opinion as to
whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1559
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:26,177
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1560
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:30,518
It's impossible to tell if a mature
married woman has been raped.

1561
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:32,148
That's all.

1562
01:40:32,259 --> 01:40:36,787
Did you have an opinion about whether
she had any recent relations with a man?

1563
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:40,094
Well, as far as no sperm
was present...

1564
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,634
it didn't appear she had
a recent relation with a man.

1565
01:40:42,736 --> 01:40:45,432
- That's all.
- Just one more question, Doctor.

1566
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,973
The fact that no evidence was present
in her body...

1567
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:50,407
does not mean that
she was not raped, does it?

1568
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:51,705
No.

1569
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:54,178
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1570
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:55,680
Yes, sir.

1571
01:40:55,783 --> 01:41:00,117
Violation is sufficient for rape.
There need not be a completion.

1572
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,780
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1573
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:06,291
The people recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand.

1574
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:10,193
Since counsel for the defense
has forced the question of rape...

1575
01:41:10,297 --> 01:41:13,596
it becomes necessary to take this
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1576
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:16,435
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1577
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:17,936
Mr. Paquette...

1578
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:22,766
would you take a look at Mrs. Manion
seated there behind the defense table.

1579
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:25,310
Was she dressed in this manner
the night of the shooting?

1580
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:27,676
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1581
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:32,582
She had on a real tight skirt and
sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.

1582
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:35,314
She was wearing red shoes
with high heels.

1583
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:38,823
- Was she wearing hose?
- No, she was bare-legged.

1584
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,690
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1585
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:45,458
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion
have under that hat?

1586
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:49,058
We'd be very happy to show the court
Mrs. Manion's hair.

1587
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:52,070
Mrs. Manion, would you
take off your hat, please?

1588
01:41:56,977 --> 01:41:59,571
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1589
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,979
Was she wearing glasses
that night?

1590
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,574
I think she was
when she played pinball.

1591
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:10,123
Considering the tight skirt and
the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1592
01:42:10,224 --> 01:42:13,352
what was the result
in her appearance?

1593
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:17,988
Would you say her appearance was
deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1594
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:19,759
You could see everything she had.

1595
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:23,462
The defense will concede that
Mrs. Manion when dressed informally...

1596
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,767
is an astonishingly beautiful woman
and we...

1597
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:29,138
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please,
will you?

1598
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:31,438
As a matter of fact...
Take your glasses off.

1599
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:35,777
It's pretty easy to understand why her
husband became temporarily deranged...

1600
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:39,341
when he saw such beauty bruised
and torn by a beast!

1601
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:41,648
Your Honor, I protest.

1602
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:43,916
Mr. Biegler is perhaps
the least disciplined...

1603
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:47,425
and the most completely out of order
attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.

1604
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:50,429
The jury will ignore
Mr. Biegler's oration.

1605
01:42:54,268 --> 01:42:57,237
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily
that night?

1606
01:42:57,337 --> 01:43:01,398
I sold her six drinks myself and
Barney came over and got more for her.

1607
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:04,443
- I don't remember how many.
- Would you say she was tight?

1608
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:07,207
- She was high, all right.
- What did she do to make you think that?

1609
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,613
She took off her shoes
and went barefooted.

1610
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:14,517
When she played pinball, she'd swish
around to give the machine English.

1611
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:18,148
You mean she was flipping
her hips around?

1612
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:21,250
- Yeah.
- Anything else?

1613
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:26,162
When she made a good score, she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do.

1614
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:28,632
She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night.

1615
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:29,929
- Wasn't she?
- Yes.

1616
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,335
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

1617
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:35,499
- Friendly.
- More than friendly, would you say?

1618
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:38,339
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?

1619
01:43:38,445 --> 01:43:41,471
She'd kind of lean on him.

1620
01:43:41,582 --> 01:43:43,482
A couple of times she bumped him
with her hip.

1621
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:49,211
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1622
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:53,054
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness.

1623
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,560
I withdraw the question.
Would you say...

1624
01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:58,358
Mrs. Manion was free and easy
with Barney Quill?

1625
01:43:58,465 --> 01:44:00,490
- I would.
- Your witness.

1626
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:02,068
Mr. Paquette...

1627
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:06,003
the attorney for the people
asked you if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...

1628
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:08,540
and you said
that she was "high."

1629
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:12,703
Now, speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1630
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:17,113
- I don't understand.
- When we say a person's "tight"...

1631
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:21,586
we usually mean they're a little stupid
with the drink, isn't that so?

1632
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:23,553
I guess so.

1633
01:44:23,657 --> 01:44:27,491
And if they're "high"
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1634
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,858
In other words,
Mrs. Manion was happy.

1635
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:32,397
Is there anything wrong with being happy
in Thunder Bay Inn?

1636
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:33,557
No.

1637
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:36,500
Thunder Bay itself is a resort,
isn't it?

1638
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:39,766
- Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing.
- Yes.

1639
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:43,138
Is there anything unusual about seeing
a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1640
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:44,471
No.

1641
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:47,069
So Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off
in Thunder Bay...

1642
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:50,240
that doesn't mean
she's being unladylike, does it?

1643
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,250
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1644
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:53,751
No!

1645
01:44:55,555 --> 01:45:00,288
Now, you testified that
Mrs. Manion was squealing...

1646
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:03,295
and jumping up and down...

1647
01:45:03,397 --> 01:45:06,059
and swishing her... I think that
was the expression you used...

1648
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:08,532
swishing her hips
around the pinball machine.

1649
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:12,503
Now, was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1650
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:15,871
Were the men at the bar all
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

1651
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:18,501
- No.
- But you were very conscious of her.

1652
01:45:18,612 --> 01:45:21,274
Conscious enough so that you can tell us
all about her actions?

1653
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:23,281
- Yes.
- And certainly Barney Quill...

1654
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:27,376
he was conscious of her because
he was playing pinball with her, right?

1655
01:45:27,487 --> 01:45:31,514
So it seems that only you
and Barney Quill were acutely aware...

1656
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:34,924
of Mrs. Manion and her actions
and her appearance.

1657
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:37,656
Maybe good old Barney when he came up
to get some drinks from you...

1658
01:45:37,764 --> 01:45:42,167
maybe he winked and said, "Alphonse,
I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."

1659
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:44,328
- No, he didn't.
- Maybe you said...

1660
01:45:44,438 --> 01:45:46,338
"Do it once for me, boss."

1661
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,431
Objection.

1662
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:51,102
No more questions!

1663
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:55,147
The court's had about all of this
dogfight it can take for one day.

1664
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:58,775
And I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1665
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:02,685
Tomorrow the defense takes over
and with expedition, prayer...

1666
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:05,189
and a little self-discipline
on the part of counsel...

1667
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:08,022
perhaps we can reach an end
by Saturday night.

1668
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:10,926
Will you adjourn court?

1669
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,760
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1670
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:16,165
This court stands adjourned
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

1671
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:00,412
He's banged up a little, but there
doesn't seem to be anything else.

1672
01:47:00,514 --> 01:47:03,005
We'd like to watch him
for a day or so.

1673
01:47:03,116 --> 01:47:05,710
How much damage did he do?

1674
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:08,379
Wrecked a gate and a barn door.

1675
01:47:08,488 --> 01:47:10,888
He hasn't got a driver's license.

1676
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:15,788
He'll have to appear
in the J.P. Court when he's able...

1677
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:17,693
the old fool.

1678
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:19,891
Speak kindly of the dead.

1679
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,059
Mind if I have a minute
with the corpse?

1680
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:23,727
Sure.

1681
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,368
Now, was it worth trying
to kill yourself...

1682
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:33,571
for whatever it is
you've been up to?

1683
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,580
How is the trial going?

1684
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:38,810
I'm making a lot of noise
and Dancer's racking up all the points.

1685
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:42,047
But come on.
Where have you been?

1686
01:47:42,155 --> 01:47:46,524
Quill hired Mary Pilant up north
of Sault St. Marie.

1687
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:50,926
Struck me funny he'd go all the way up
there to hire somebody to work for him.

1688
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:53,090
I've been up there nosing around.

1689
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,327
Did you find anything useful?

1690
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:58,427
Not until I looked up
her birth certificate.

1691
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:02,201
Born Blind River, Ontario, 1934...

1692
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,209
out of wedlock.

1693
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:08,304
Mother was a waitress,
Simone Pilant.

1694
01:48:08,415 --> 01:48:12,613
Father was a lumberjack
named Barney Quill.

1695
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:23,994
- I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.
- It's late, mister.

1696
01:48:24,097 --> 01:48:26,122
I know. This is important.

1697
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:28,633
- Real important?
- Real important.

1698
01:48:33,573 --> 01:48:35,473
- Yes?
- Miss Pilant, sorry if I woke you.

1699
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:37,975
There's a guy to see you.
Says it's real important.

1700
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:39,978
- What's your...
- Paul Biegler.

1701
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,981
- I don't wish to see him.
- Okay.

1702
01:48:44,217 --> 01:48:46,310
She said it's not important enough.

1703
01:48:46,419 --> 01:48:50,412
Call her back and tell her I mentioned
Blind River, Ontario.

1704
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,754
I'll be in the bar.

1705
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:10,508
Good evening, Alphonse.

1706
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,840
Drinking or just snooping?

1707
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:16,848
I think I'll try a little of both.
What do you say we start with a beer.

1708
01:49:22,155 --> 01:49:24,988
On the house.
And that's all you get... a beer.

1709
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:27,059
No questions, no answers.

1710
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,628
I'm just a lawyer
trying to do my job.

1711
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:32,163
What are you so afraid of?

1712
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:37,761
Let's sit over there, please.

1713
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:47,104
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.
I was rough when I was here before.

1714
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:50,506
I didn't know Barney Quill
was your father.

1715
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:53,415
You didn't come here
just to apologize.

1716
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,454
No, but the apology was part of it.

1717
01:49:55,555 --> 01:50:00,185
To tell you the truth, I was hoping
it would thaw you out a little bit.

1718
01:50:00,293 --> 01:50:04,423
All I want you to do is listen to me,
just for a few minutes.

1719
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:09,332
I need some strong evidence to back up
Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1720
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:12,928
The prosecution's gonna attack
that story pretty hard.

1721
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:15,530
And if the jury thinks she's lying...

1722
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:18,406
that could turn the decision
against Manion.

1723
01:50:18,511 --> 01:50:20,570
Isn't she lying?

1724
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:23,444
Barney didn't do what she said he did.
He couldn't have.

1725
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:27,714
- What did you know about your father?
- All I needed to know.

1726
01:50:27,821 --> 01:50:31,780
He took care of me and my mother
for as long as she lived.

1727
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:35,156
He was always there
when I needed him.

1728
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:37,821
That's what I know about my father,
Mr. Biegler.

1729
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:40,126
Will that back up
Laura Manion's story?

1730
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:43,168
I don't want to get at you,
hurt you.

1731
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:45,794
I appreciate your affection
for your father.

1732
01:50:45,905 --> 01:50:51,434
But as a lawyer I've had to learn
that people aren't just good or bad...

1733
01:50:51,544 --> 01:50:53,842
but people are many things.

1734
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:57,474
And I kind of have a feeling
Barney Quill was many things.

1735
01:50:57,584 --> 01:51:00,576
- I don't want to hear any more.
- No, please. Hear me out.

1736
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:04,555
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette
what happened that night.

1737
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:07,855
And he told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1738
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:12,694
Barney stayed behind the bar
next to a gun rack, just waiting.

1739
01:51:12,799 --> 01:51:16,200
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1740
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:18,998
and the first shot
went right through Barney's heart.

1741
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:21,335
Now here's what I want you to do.

1742
01:51:21,441 --> 01:51:24,933
I want you to try to persuade Al
to come to the court...

1743
01:51:25,045 --> 01:51:29,072
as a defense witness and tell the court
what Barney told him that night...

1744
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:32,049
that he raped and assaulted
Mrs. Manion.

1745
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:36,816
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?

1746
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:40,120
I don't know.
But I know this.

1747
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:43,787
Everybody loves something
or someone.

1748
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:48,129
Me, I love fishing
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1749
01:51:48,234 --> 01:51:51,726
Manion loves his freedom.
He'd like to have a little more of it.

1750
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:55,865
Barney loved you.
Maybe so does Al.

1751
01:51:55,975 --> 01:51:58,034
I wouldn't blame him.

1752
01:51:58,144 --> 01:52:01,841
But he doesn't want to hurt you or
for you to know the truth about Barney...

1753
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:04,041
that he could be dangerous
and brutal.

1754
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:08,177
Now, if you just ask Al...
if you just ask him right straight out.

1755
01:52:18,598 --> 01:52:22,193
Al, Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1756
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:27,500
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed...

1757
01:52:27,607 --> 01:52:29,234
something you won't tell.

1758
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:33,711
Lawyer, I told you once and I'll tell
you again... No questions, no answers.

1759
01:52:33,813 --> 01:52:35,371
Wait.

1760
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:40,816
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1761
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:43,150
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1762
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,353
Is there any reason you wouldn't
tell me the truth about that?

1763
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:51,361
What reason?

1764
01:52:57,337 --> 01:52:59,100
Anything else?

1765
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:02,940
I'm going to leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1766
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:06,808
You might like to watch
Lt. Manion get convicted.

1767
01:53:06,913 --> 01:53:09,177
You going to spread it around
about Mary being Barney's kid?

1768
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:12,945
No, I'm not going to spread it
around, Al. Thank you for the beer.

1769
01:53:13,052 --> 01:53:14,952
Good night, Miss Pilant.

1770
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:21,592
All right. Let's get at
this rosary thing.

1771
01:53:21,694 --> 01:53:24,754
It's been testified that your wife
swore to you on a rosary...

1772
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:27,298
that she'd been raped
by Barney Quill.

1773
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:29,891
Did you ask your wife
to swear on a rosary?

1774
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:34,231
My wife was hysterical.
She wasn't making much sense.

1775
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,468
I thought if I asked her to take
an oath on a rosary...

1776
01:53:37,577 --> 01:53:40,478
it might serve to calm her,
make her think more clearly.

1777
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,571
Did the rosary help?

1778
01:53:42,682 --> 01:53:45,173
She was able to tell me
in detail what had happened.

1779
01:53:45,285 --> 01:53:49,346
All right. Go on from there.
What did you do then, Lieutenant?

1780
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:51,616
Well, l...

1781
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:55,125
I had her lie on the bed,
and I got some cold cloths...

1782
01:53:55,228 --> 01:53:57,321
for her head.

1783
01:53:57,430 --> 01:54:01,059
And, uh...
Oh, yes. I gave her a drink of brandy.

1784
01:54:03,203 --> 01:54:06,639
After a while, she became calm,
seemed to go to sleep.

1785
01:54:07,907 --> 01:54:10,205
Then I went to the closet...

1786
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,437
I got my gun,
and I loaded it.

1787
01:54:12,545 --> 01:54:15,480
Was it in your mind
to kill Barney Quill?

1788
01:54:15,582 --> 01:54:16,742
No.

1789
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:19,842
Then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1790
01:54:19,953 --> 01:54:23,411
I knew I had to go to Quill's place.
I thought I might need it.

1791
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:25,354
Why?

1792
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:28,154
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns
behind the bar.

1793
01:54:28,261 --> 01:54:29,922
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1794
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:31,929
Might shoot you if you did what?

1795
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,932
What were you going to do?

1796
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:37,161
I'm not sure.

1797
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:39,932
I remember having some idea...

1798
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:42,303
of finding him...

1799
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:45,434
and holding him
while I call the police.

1800
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:47,342
Well, that Mr. Whatshisname...

1801
01:54:47,447 --> 01:54:50,507
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court there,
he was a deputy sheriff.

1802
01:54:50,617 --> 01:54:53,017
Why didn't you get him
to go with you?

1803
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,144
Maybe because he always
seemed to be just...

1804
01:54:55,255 --> 01:54:57,450
the old caretaker of the park.

1805
01:54:58,825 --> 01:55:02,283
Maybe because I wasn't thinking
about anything too clearly...

1806
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:04,420
except finding Barney Quill.

1807
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:08,227
Why didn't you go to a phone, call
the police before you went to the bar?

1808
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:10,495
I don't know.

1809
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:13,800
I was in sort of a daze.

1810
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:16,808
It was a horrible thing to see
what had been done to my wife.

1811
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:19,071
Now, you say you were in
sort of a daze.

1812
01:55:19,178 --> 01:55:22,841
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1813
01:55:25,451 --> 01:55:28,249
I didn't see anyone at the bar...

1814
01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:31,152
except Barney Quill.

1815
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:34,522
- He was the only person I saw.
- What was he doing?

1816
01:55:35,662 --> 01:55:39,291
I think he was just standing there
behind the bar.

1817
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:43,563
Now, did he make a threatening move
to get a gun?

1818
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:47,106
I don't know.
May have. I don't know.

1819
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:50,141
All right. Now, you say
you went there to find him...

1820
01:55:50,243 --> 01:55:52,177
to hold him for the police.

1821
01:55:52,278 --> 01:55:54,178
Why did you shoot him?

1822
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:58,279
I don't remember shooting him.

1823
01:55:59,385 --> 01:56:02,286
Now, when you left the bar,
do you remember Alphonse Paquette...

1824
01:56:02,388 --> 01:56:04,356
coming up to you
and stopping you and saying...

1825
01:56:04,457 --> 01:56:07,392
"You'd better not run away from this,"
and you replied...

1826
01:56:07,493 --> 01:56:09,620
"You want some too, buster?"

1827
01:56:09,729 --> 01:56:12,493
Remember that?

1828
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:16,432
I seem to have a vague recollection
of somebody speaking to me...

1829
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:21,240
but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

1830
01:56:21,341 --> 01:56:24,242
When did you realize
that you'd shot Quill?

1831
01:56:27,013 --> 01:56:29,504
I was getting a drink of water.

1832
01:56:29,615 --> 01:56:32,675
I remember my throat was so dry
it hurt.

1833
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:37,453
And when I put the glass down,
I saw the gun on the kitchen sink...

1834
01:56:37,557 --> 01:56:39,923
beside the tap.

1835
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:41,926
I noticed the gun was empty.

1836
01:56:43,029 --> 01:56:45,827
Now, I'd like you to show
the court and jury...

1837
01:56:48,401 --> 01:56:50,892
just how you knew
this gun was empty.

1838
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:53,495
Well, this gadget here...

1839
01:56:53,606 --> 01:56:57,372
when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1840
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:02,673
On the night of the shooting,
did you love your wife?

1841
01:57:02,782 --> 01:57:06,013
- Yes, sir.
- Do you still love her?

1842
01:57:09,489 --> 01:57:11,855
Very much.

1843
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:14,085
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1844
01:57:17,296 --> 01:57:19,662
How many men have you killed?

1845
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:22,098
Now, wait a minute!

1846
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:25,534
Your Honor, a man's war record...
in Lt. Manion's case, a great record...

1847
01:57:25,638 --> 01:57:27,663
certainly shouldn't be used
against him.

1848
01:57:27,774 --> 01:57:30,709
I'm as patriotic as the next man...

1849
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,335
but the simple truth is,
war can condition a man...

1850
01:57:33,446 --> 01:57:35,607
to killing other men.

1851
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:38,309
I simply want to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may be...

1852
01:57:38,418 --> 01:57:41,876
to the use of firearms
on other human beings.

1853
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:45,856
I don't like the question, Mr. Biegler,
but I don't see how I can exclude it.

1854
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:47,653
Let him answer.

1855
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,423
I know I killed
at least four men in Korea...

1856
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:53,431
three with a hand grenade...

1857
01:57:53,533 --> 01:57:55,763
and one with my service automatic.

1858
01:57:55,868 --> 01:57:59,668
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1859
01:57:59,772 --> 01:58:02,002
Now, Lieutenant,
in these acts of killing...

1860
01:58:02,108 --> 01:58:05,737
did you ever have a lapse of memory such
as you had when you killed Barney Quill?

1861
01:58:05,845 --> 01:58:08,939
- No, sir.
- Did you ever have one during battle?

1862
01:58:09,048 --> 01:58:10,606
- No, sir.
- Were you ever submitted...

1863
01:58:10,716 --> 01:58:13,378
to a constant barrage,
constantly in a sweat for many hours...

1864
01:58:13,486 --> 01:58:15,750
- constantly under attack or attacking?
- Many times.

1865
01:58:15,855 --> 01:58:19,222
Were you ever treated for shell shock,
battle fatigue, neuroses or psychoses?

1866
01:58:19,325 --> 01:58:21,486
- No, sir.
- Did you ever experience...

1867
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:24,188
any unusual mental state
during the war?

1868
01:58:24,297 --> 01:58:26,527
Well, I do remember having
one great urge.

1869
01:58:26,632 --> 01:58:30,466
- What was that?
- To get the hell out and go home.

1870
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:33,130
You would do well to consider
the seriousness...

1871
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:34,934
of the situation you're in.

1872
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:38,033
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- I sympathize with the lieutenant.

1873
01:58:38,144 --> 01:58:42,137
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

1874
01:58:42,248 --> 01:58:44,409
But the main point here
is that at no time...

1875
01:58:44,517 --> 01:58:47,111
during your war service did you have
a record of mental disturbance.

1876
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,415
You were always in complete possession
of your faculties.

1877
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:51,888
Yes, sir. That's right.

1878
01:58:51,991 --> 01:58:54,789
- No more questions.
- No redirect, Your Honor.

1879
01:58:54,894 --> 01:58:57,328
Step down, please.
Call your next witness.

1880
01:58:57,430 --> 01:59:00,024
We call Laura Manion
to the stand.

1881
01:59:12,278 --> 01:59:15,679
- Up these stairs and to the right.
- Thanks.

1882
01:59:21,587 --> 01:59:24,215
How long after you told
your husband what had happened...

1883
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:26,450
did he leave the trailer?

1884
01:59:26,559 --> 01:59:28,550
I don't know exactly.

1885
01:59:28,661 --> 01:59:30,322
Everything was kind of fuzzy.

1886
01:59:30,429 --> 01:59:33,091
I was faint,
and I laid down on the bed.

1887
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:35,258
He sat beside me.

1888
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:38,303
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

1889
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:40,998
I remember wondering
if he was going for a doctor...

1890
01:59:41,107 --> 01:59:43,302
and then he came back in.

1891
01:59:43,409 --> 01:59:45,969
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must have been longer.

1892
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:48,672
I must've gone to sleep.

1893
01:59:48,781 --> 01:59:51,682
When he came back in,
he sat on the bed...

1894
01:59:51,784 --> 01:59:53,809
and he had a gun in his hand.

1895
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,854
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

1896
01:59:57,023 --> 02:00:00,015
And he said,
"I think I've already done it.

1897
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:02,321
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1898
02:00:02,428 --> 02:00:05,920
Are you sure he didn't say,
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

1899
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:08,523
No, I remember distinctly.

1900
02:00:08,634 --> 02:00:10,534
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1901
02:00:10,636 --> 02:00:12,604
Then what did you do?

1902
02:00:12,705 --> 02:00:16,971
I put my arms around him
and began to cry...

1903
02:00:17,076 --> 02:00:19,977
and I said,
"You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

1904
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:22,070
And my husband said,
"I forgot about that."

1905
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,911
What did he mean?
Forgot about what?

1906
02:00:25,017 --> 02:00:28,509
He meant he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

1907
02:00:28,621 --> 02:00:31,385
And he said, "Yes,
I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

1908
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:32,821
Yes, I see.

1909
02:00:32,925 --> 02:00:36,224
Your Honor, I have no other
direct questions at this time.

1910
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:39,321
But since I'm sure it's difficult
to visualize the part...

1911
02:00:39,432 --> 02:00:42,094
a little dog played on this night...

1912
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:45,830
I should like a few minutes to show
the court this remarkable little animal.

1913
02:00:45,938 --> 02:00:47,929
Do the people object?

1914
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:49,940
I'm sure that if we raise
an objection, Your Honor...

1915
02:00:50,042 --> 02:00:53,273
Mr. Biegler will declare that we are
haters of all small, furry animals.

1916
02:00:53,379 --> 02:00:57,338
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

1917
02:00:57,450 --> 02:00:59,441
Bring in the dog.

1918
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:04,182
Thank you, sir. Will the deputy
bring in the dog, please?

1919
02:01:17,536 --> 02:01:19,731
You can put him right there.

1920
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,233
Hey, Muff! Come on!

1921
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:27,474
That's a boy.

1922
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:31,038
And now I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

1923
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:46,664
I'll ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

1924
02:01:55,741 --> 02:01:59,006
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know
who his enemies are.

1925
02:01:59,111 --> 02:02:01,272
- Remove the dog, please.
- Yes, sir.

1926
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:04,042
- The witness will resume the stand.
- There we go, Muff.

1927
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:11,748
May I congratulate you
on your well trained pet.

1928
02:02:11,857 --> 02:02:14,792
May I also say I'm pleased to see
you're not today...

1929
02:02:14,894 --> 02:02:17,158
hiding your lovely hair
under a hat.

1930
02:02:17,263 --> 02:02:20,960
Your Honor, is the assistant attorney
general from Lansing pitching woo...

1931
02:02:21,067 --> 02:02:24,798
- or is he going to cross-examine?
- Let's get on with it.

1932
02:02:24,904 --> 02:02:27,236
Mrs. Manion, what was your occupation
before you were married?

1933
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:30,241
- Housewife.
- Then you've been married before?

1934
02:02:30,343 --> 02:02:34,712
- Yes, once.
- I suppose your first husband died?

1935
02:02:34,814 --> 02:02:36,042
No.

1936
02:02:36,148 --> 02:02:38,844
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lt. Manion?

1937
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:40,646
Your Honor, if counsel wants
to know the grounds...

1938
02:02:40,753 --> 02:02:43,017
for Mrs. Manion's divorce,
let him ask that question.

1939
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:44,851
What were the grounds
for divorce?

1940
02:02:44,957 --> 02:02:48,017
- Mental cruelty.
- Naturally. And how long after...

1941
02:02:48,127 --> 02:02:50,755
your divorce was it
that you married Lt. Manion?

1942
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:52,592
I'm not sure.

1943
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:55,758
May I refresh the witness' memory
for Mr. Dancer?

1944
02:02:55,868 --> 02:02:57,995
- By all means.
- I believe she told me...

1945
02:02:58,104 --> 02:03:01,335
that they were married
three days after the divorce.

1946
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,704
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.
Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?

1947
02:03:05,144 --> 02:03:07,635
Then unless yours was
a whirlwind courtship...

1948
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:09,840
you must have known Lt. Manion
before your divorce.

1949
02:03:09,949 --> 02:03:12,042
- Did you?
- Yes.

1950
02:03:12,151 --> 02:03:14,676
Mrs. Manion, what is your...

1951
02:03:14,787 --> 02:03:16,778
religious affiliation?

1952
02:03:16,889 --> 02:03:20,256
- I'm a Catholic.
- Catholic in good standing?

1953
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:22,259
Well, no. The divorce, you know.

1954
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:24,921
You mean you were excommunicated
because of the divorce and remarriage.

1955
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:26,258
Yes.

1956
02:03:26,365 --> 02:03:29,061
Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say
that a Catholic...

1957
02:03:29,168 --> 02:03:32,797
who can blithely ignore one of
the cardinal rules of her church...

1958
02:03:32,905 --> 02:03:36,432
could also easily ignore an oath
taken on one of its artifacts...

1959
02:03:36,542 --> 02:03:38,942
say, an oath taken on a rosary?

1960
02:03:40,513 --> 02:03:42,777
I don't think that's true.

1961
02:03:42,882 --> 02:03:46,249
Wouldn't you think there'd be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person?

1962
02:03:47,153 --> 02:03:49,053
I don't know.

1963
02:03:49,155 --> 02:03:51,589
All I know is the rosary
means something to me.

1964
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:56,024
I see.
Well, I'll pass on to something else.

1965
02:03:56,128 --> 02:03:58,494
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that your husband...

1966
02:03:58,597 --> 02:04:00,827
came home late from his work
on the night of the shooting.

1967
02:04:00,933 --> 02:04:02,833
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

1968
02:04:02,935 --> 02:04:06,496
- I guess I was a little put out.
- Did you have an argument?

1969
02:04:06,605 --> 02:04:08,505
Not much. A little.

1970
02:04:08,607 --> 02:04:10,768
When you left the trailer
to go to the inn...

1971
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:13,902
- did your husband know you were going?
- He was asleep.

1972
02:04:14,013 --> 02:04:16,174
Was part of your reason for going
without his knowledge...

1973
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:18,477
because you were vexed?

1974
02:04:19,485 --> 02:04:23,114
Well, I'd been ironing all day,
and l...

1975
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:25,713
- Yes, I guess that's true.
- Your Honor, the counsel...

1976
02:04:25,825 --> 02:04:28,123
has deliberately
cut off my view of the witness.

1977
02:04:28,227 --> 02:04:31,924
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't want
to interfere with your signals to her.

1978
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:34,591
I object to the implication
I was signaling the witness.

1979
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:37,692
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick
I've ever seen.

1980
02:04:37,803 --> 02:04:41,967
- You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.
- I ask for a rule on my objection.

1981
02:04:42,074 --> 02:04:44,565
Mr. Dancer, will you be careful
not to place yourself...

1982
02:04:44,677 --> 02:04:46,668
between Mr. Biegler and his witness?

1983
02:04:46,779 --> 02:04:48,747
Of course, Your Honor.

1984
02:04:48,848 --> 02:04:51,646
- Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
- You do it once more...

1985
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:56,084
I'll punch you all the way out
into the middle of Lake Superior.

1986
02:04:56,188 --> 02:04:58,349
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

1987
02:04:58,457 --> 02:05:00,652
This rowing has got to stop.

1988
02:05:00,759 --> 02:05:04,695
The next one of you that speaks
out of turn will have me to deal with.

1989
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:07,027
Get on with your cross-examination.

1990
02:05:07,132 --> 02:05:10,363
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had been awake?

1991
02:05:10,469 --> 02:05:13,870
- He probably would have gone with me.
- But would you have gone alone?

1992
02:05:13,973 --> 02:05:18,205
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

1993
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:20,904
I'm not sure.
I don't know how to answer that.

1994
02:05:21,013 --> 02:05:23,607
Had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn, or...

1995
02:05:23,716 --> 02:05:26,617
elsewhere in Thunder Bay alone
at night?

1996
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:29,950
- Yes, sometimes.
- Did your husband know you were going?

1997
02:05:30,055 --> 02:05:33,183
Not always.
He goes to sleep early...

1998
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:36,022
and sometimes I'm restless.

1999
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:39,928
- Where did you go on these occasions?
- I'd take a walk by the lake, or...

2000
02:05:40,032 --> 02:05:43,490
go into the bingo place,
maybe to the inn.

2001
02:05:43,602 --> 02:05:46,298
You ever go to meet another man?

2002
02:05:46,405 --> 02:05:48,373
No, I didn't.
I never did that.

2003
02:05:48,474 --> 02:05:51,341
You mean to say, Mrs. Manion,
a lovely women like yourself...

2004
02:05:51,443 --> 02:05:54,844
attractive to men, lonely, restless,
that you never once met...

2005
02:05:54,947 --> 02:05:57,939
Objection, Your Honor. The witness has
answered the question about other men.

2006
02:05:58,050 --> 02:06:00,814
The counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

2007
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,911
I withdraw the question.

2008
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:07,425
Mrs. Manion, on these occasional
excursions into the night...

2009
02:06:07,526 --> 02:06:10,086
did you always go
and return home alone?

2010
02:06:10,195 --> 02:06:11,628
Of course.

2011
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,994
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that the reason you got...

2012
02:06:14,099 --> 02:06:17,728
into Barney Quill's car was because
you were afraid to go home alone.

2013
02:06:17,836 --> 02:06:19,804
Why were you so frightened
on this night?

2014
02:06:19,905 --> 02:06:24,342
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

2015
02:06:24,443 --> 02:06:26,638
Was this the first time
you heard that...

2016
02:06:26,745 --> 02:06:28,736
bears came around Thunder Bay
for scraps?

2017
02:06:28,847 --> 02:06:31,611
- No.
- Had you seen the bears before?

2018
02:06:31,717 --> 02:06:32,775
Yes.

2019
02:06:32,885 --> 02:06:35,285
Oh, this was just the first time
you were afraid of them.

2020
02:06:35,387 --> 02:06:37,617
No, I was always afraid of them.

2021
02:06:37,723 --> 02:06:40,521
Oh, this was just the first time
you were enough afraid to allow...

2022
02:06:40,626 --> 02:06:43,186
a man to take you home
from one of your evening prowls.

2023
02:06:43,295 --> 02:06:46,958
Objection. Use of the word "prowls."
Meant to mislead the jury.

2024
02:06:47,066 --> 02:06:50,126
- Sustained.
- I apologize, Mrs. Manion.

2025
02:06:50,235 --> 02:06:52,999
I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

2026
02:06:53,105 --> 02:06:55,767
Was this the first time that
you were enough afraid to allow a man...

2027
02:06:55,874 --> 02:06:59,071
to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

2028
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:02,011
Well, it wasn't just that.

2029
02:07:02,114 --> 02:07:04,014
- It was...
- Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.

2030
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:06,550
You should be able to answer that
straight off. That's a simple question.

2031
02:07:06,652 --> 02:07:09,314
Your Honor, how can the witness
answer straight off...

2032
02:07:09,421 --> 02:07:11,616
when the counsel keeps interrupting
the answer?

2033
02:07:11,724 --> 02:07:14,887
The witness seemed
a little slow to me, Mr. Biegler.

2034
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:17,929
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

2035
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:20,498
Of course, Your Honor. In any case,
Mr. Biegler's objection...

2036
02:07:20,599 --> 02:07:23,591
has given Mr. Manion sufficient time
to think of an answer to my question.

2037
02:07:23,702 --> 02:07:25,602
You've thought of one, haven't you?

2038
02:07:25,704 --> 02:07:29,140
What I was going to say was that
I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...

2039
02:07:29,241 --> 02:07:32,438
by making him think that I was
afraid of him or didn't like him.

2040
02:07:32,544 --> 02:07:36,036
He's been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

2041
02:07:36,148 --> 02:07:38,139
That's very good, Mrs. Manion.
Very good, indeed.

2042
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:41,219
- Your Honor, please.
- The attorney for the people...

2043
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,084
will reserve his comments
for the arguments.

2044
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:47,386
I will ask you this question,
Mrs. Manion.

2045
02:07:47,493 --> 02:07:52,556
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

2046
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:58,467
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

2047
02:07:58,570 --> 02:08:00,936
Yes, I heard.

2048
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,941
Yes, it was the first time.

2049
02:08:04,043 --> 02:08:06,739
Would you raise your voice
a little, Mrs. Manion?

2050
02:08:06,845 --> 02:08:10,042
I said it was the first time.

2051
02:08:10,149 --> 02:08:12,242
Now, Mrs. Manion...

2052
02:08:12,351 --> 02:08:14,945
I'm quite concerned
about the lost panties.

2053
02:08:15,054 --> 02:08:18,023
Would you describe this article
of clothing to the courtroom?

2054
02:08:19,658 --> 02:08:22,525
They were nylon,
and had lace up the sides.

2055
02:08:22,628 --> 02:08:25,096
There was a label in them
of the place I got them...

2056
02:08:25,197 --> 02:08:28,724
- The Smart Shop in Phoenix, Arizona.
- What was the color of the panties?

2057
02:08:28,834 --> 02:08:30,768
- I believe, white.
- You believe?

2058
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:33,167
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

2059
02:08:33,272 --> 02:08:34,967
You're not sure?
Haven't you checked your lingerie...

2060
02:08:35,074 --> 02:08:37,042
to see which pair of panties
is missing?

2061
02:08:37,142 --> 02:08:38,939
- No.
- When your husband came home late...

2062
02:08:39,044 --> 02:08:43,276
from work, and you had this little spat,
were you already dressed to go out?

2063
02:08:43,382 --> 02:08:45,282
- No.
- When did you dress?

2064
02:08:45,384 --> 02:08:47,113
After dinner, when he was asleep.

2065
02:08:47,219 --> 02:08:51,121
It's been stated here that you were
bare legged in the bar. Is that true?

2066
02:08:51,223 --> 02:08:53,851
In your anger at your husband and
your haste to get out of the trailer...

2067
02:08:53,959 --> 02:08:55,756
perhaps you didn't put on
any panties either.

2068
02:08:55,861 --> 02:08:58,796
Objection. Witness has already testified
of what she was wearing.

2069
02:08:58,897 --> 02:09:01,388
- Sustained.
- Do you always wear panties?

2070
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:04,367
Your Honor, I object
to this line of questioning.

2071
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:07,166
It's immaterial what Mrs. Manion
does all the time.

2072
02:09:07,272 --> 02:09:09,604
On the night she was attacked,
she was wearing panties...

2073
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:12,006
and that's all we're concerned with.

2074
02:09:12,111 --> 02:09:16,047
Mrs. Manion seems a little bit uncertain
about the kind of panties she wore.

2075
02:09:16,148 --> 02:09:19,208
And since these panties have not been
found, I submit that it's possible...

2076
02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:21,786
she wasn't wearing any
and has forgotten.

2077
02:09:21,887 --> 02:09:26,153
- That's all I'm trying to get at.
- You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2078
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:29,421
You always wear panties?

2079
02:09:29,528 --> 02:09:31,359
No.

2080
02:09:31,463 --> 02:09:34,455
On what occasions don't you wear them?
When you go out alone at night?

2081
02:09:34,566 --> 02:09:38,468
No, no. Objection. He says he's going
after one thing and goes after another.

2082
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:40,504
I'll sustain the objection.

2083
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:44,201
Strike out the last two questions
in Mrs. Manion's answer.

2084
02:09:44,309 --> 02:09:48,746
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.

2085
02:09:48,847 --> 02:09:50,838
Yes, Your Honor.

2086
02:09:50,949 --> 02:09:55,045
Mrs. Manion,
is your husband a jealous man?

2087
02:09:55,154 --> 02:09:58,385
- He loves me.
- I'm sure, but is he overly jealous?

2088
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:01,288
Your Honor, how can the witness
answer that question?

2089
02:10:01,393 --> 02:10:03,327
What's the norm of jealousy?

2090
02:10:03,428 --> 02:10:06,454
Can you put your question
a little differently, Mr. Dancer?

2091
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:09,398
- Has your husband struck you in a rage?
- No, Your Honor.

2092
02:10:09,501 --> 02:10:12,732
I think Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevance of this question?

2093
02:10:12,838 --> 02:10:14,965
Your Honor, the shoe is squeezing
Mr. Biegler's foot.

2094
02:10:15,073 --> 02:10:16,973
In his own words,
this is not a high school debate.

2095
02:10:17,075 --> 02:10:19,236
This is a cross-examination
in a murder trial.

2096
02:10:19,344 --> 02:10:21,244
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2097
02:10:25,751 --> 02:10:28,948
Did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2098
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:30,885
Yes, a few times.

2099
02:10:30,989 --> 02:10:33,856
When your husband's outfit moved
to Thunder Bay, didn't Barney Quill...

2100
02:10:33,959 --> 02:10:37,417
throw a cocktail party
for the officers and their wives?

2101
02:10:37,529 --> 02:10:40,498
Didn't your husband strike a young
second lieutenant at this party?

2102
02:10:41,567 --> 02:10:44,730
There was a little scuffle.
It wasn't much.

2103
02:10:44,837 --> 02:10:48,102
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2104
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:51,802
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2105
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:55,270
I think it was because...

2106
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:59,373
the lieutenant was cutting in too much
when I was dancing with my husband.

2107
02:10:59,484 --> 02:11:02,647
Shortly after on the verandah, didn't
your husband slap you hard enough...

2108
02:11:02,754 --> 02:11:04,949
so that you fell against the wall?

2109
02:11:07,526 --> 02:11:10,017
- He was drinking.
- Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2110
02:11:10,128 --> 02:11:14,292
- I don't know!
- Do you remember why he struck you?

2111
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:18,699
Wasn't he enraged at you because he
thought you'd encouraged the young man?

2112
02:11:18,804 --> 02:11:21,705
- He might have thought so.
- There are witnesses to this affair.

2113
02:11:21,807 --> 02:11:24,401
I'll ask you again.
Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2114
02:11:24,509 --> 02:11:26,807
I guess you could call it that.

2115
02:11:28,313 --> 02:11:31,840
Now I'll ask you.

2116
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:34,384
On the night of the shooting...

2117
02:11:34,486 --> 02:11:36,283
what did you swear?

2118
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:38,583
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2119
02:11:39,825 --> 02:11:43,625
- It was about Barney Quill raping me.
- Why did you swear on the rosary...

2120
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:45,959
that he raped you?

2121
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:48,692
For the reason my husband said...
because I was hysterical!

2122
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,394
That was the reason he gave for asking
you to swear. What was it for swearing?

2123
02:11:51,503 --> 02:11:53,437
- So he'd believe me.
- Why shouldn't he?

2124
02:11:53,538 --> 02:11:56,735
Objection! The reason for the use
of the rosary has been established.

2125
02:11:56,842 --> 02:11:58,434
These questions are immaterial.

2126
02:11:58,543 --> 02:12:02,138
No, I think I'll take
the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2127
02:12:02,247 --> 02:12:05,808
I'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2128
02:12:07,719 --> 02:12:09,846
Because I wasn't making much sense!

2129
02:12:09,955 --> 02:12:11,752
Did he think you'd lie
about a thing like that?

2130
02:12:11,857 --> 02:12:15,418
Objection, Your Honor! Lt. Manion had
already testified as to what he thought!

2131
02:12:15,527 --> 02:12:19,463
- Sustained.
- Did your husband strike you that night?

2132
02:12:19,564 --> 02:12:21,122
Did he hit you that night?

2133
02:12:24,102 --> 02:12:26,195
Well, he...

2134
02:12:26,305 --> 02:12:29,672
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

2135
02:12:29,775 --> 02:12:32,243
Didn't you swear to a lie to keep him
from hitting you again?

2136
02:12:32,344 --> 02:12:34,244
No, I didn't! I did not!

2137
02:12:34,346 --> 02:12:37,543
Hadn't he already beaten you up when he
caught you coming home with Quill?

2138
02:12:37,649 --> 02:12:41,881
Objection! The witness has already
testified she was beaten by Quill!

2139
02:12:41,987 --> 02:12:44,114
Quiet. Quiet.

2140
02:12:44,222 --> 02:12:46,918
No more questions.

2141
02:12:47,025 --> 02:12:49,585
I think the witness
has had enough, Your Honor.

2142
02:12:49,695 --> 02:12:52,926
The witness may step down.
We'll recess for lunch.

2143
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:56,867
Recess until 1:00.

2144
02:12:59,905 --> 02:13:01,805
I'm sorry, baby.
You were fine.

2145
02:13:35,307 --> 02:13:37,366
Dr. Smith.

2146
02:13:37,476 --> 02:13:40,138
I've come to meet you.
My name is...

2147
02:13:40,245 --> 02:13:42,975
- I'm sorry. You've been mistaken.
- Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.

2148
02:13:43,081 --> 02:13:45,049
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2149
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:47,618
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2150
02:13:47,719 --> 02:13:50,483
- Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith.
- That's me.

2151
02:13:50,589 --> 02:13:52,784
The army psychiatrist?

2152
02:13:52,891 --> 02:13:55,155
Maybe you expected me
to be in uniform.

2153
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,387
No.

2154
02:13:57,496 --> 02:13:59,987
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2155
02:14:00,098 --> 02:14:01,998
I'm 40.

2156
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:05,035
I sort of hoped you'd...

2157
02:14:05,137 --> 02:14:07,537
have a beard and wear a monocle.

2158
02:14:07,639 --> 02:14:09,732
I see.

2159
02:14:09,841 --> 02:14:12,241
Is that better?

2160
02:14:12,344 --> 02:14:14,710
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2161
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:19,946
Doctor, have you formed an opinion
as to Frederick Manion's...

2162
02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:22,987
mental and emotional state
at the time he killed Barney Quill?

2163
02:14:23,088 --> 02:14:24,715
- I have.
- And what is that opinion?

2164
02:14:24,823 --> 02:14:27,815
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2165
02:14:27,926 --> 02:14:30,121
At the time of the shooting,
do you believe he was able...

2166
02:14:30,228 --> 02:14:32,355
to distinguish right from wrong?

2167
02:14:32,464 --> 02:14:35,524
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make too much difference.

2168
02:14:35,634 --> 02:14:38,694
Now, Doctor,
as clearly as you can...

2169
02:14:38,804 --> 02:14:42,365
will you explain
Frederick Manion's temporary insanity?

2170
02:14:42,474 --> 02:14:45,500
It is known as dissociative reaction...

2171
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:47,942
a psychic shock which creates...

2172
02:14:48,046 --> 02:14:50,344
an almost overwhelming tension...

2173
02:14:50,449 --> 02:14:53,350
which the person in shock
must alleviate.

2174
02:14:53,452 --> 02:14:55,977
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...

2175
02:14:56,088 --> 02:14:58,921
it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2176
02:14:59,024 --> 02:15:01,584
Only direct, simple action...

2177
02:15:01,693 --> 02:15:05,151
against Barney Quill would relieve
this unbearable tension.

2178
02:15:05,263 --> 02:15:08,892
This is not too uncommon. For example,
in combat, some of the more...

2179
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,833
remarkable heroics take place
in this state of mind.

2180
02:15:11,937 --> 02:15:16,067
Is there another name for dissociative
reaction that we might recognize?

2181
02:15:16,174 --> 02:15:19,473
Yes, it has been known
as irresistible impulse.

2182
02:15:19,578 --> 02:15:22,809
Now, Doctor, a man in the grip
of irresistible impulse...

2183
02:15:22,914 --> 02:15:25,280
would he be likely to go
to his neighbor for advice...

2184
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:28,079
or call up the police
to come to his aid?

2185
02:15:28,186 --> 02:15:31,019
- Completely incompatible.
- Yes, but our man...

2186
02:15:31,123 --> 02:15:33,751
was able to think of going
and taking out a gun...

2187
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:36,225
and loading it before setting out
to find Quill.

2188
02:15:36,328 --> 02:15:40,731
That's his conscious mind working, but
he'd go even if a gun wasn't available.

2189
02:15:40,832 --> 02:15:44,461
How would a man look
in the grip of dissociative reaction?

2190
02:15:44,569 --> 02:15:48,596
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2191
02:15:48,707 --> 02:15:51,267
Mm-hmm.
Would you describe his behavior...

2192
02:15:51,376 --> 02:15:54,209
as being like a mailman
delivering the mail?

2193
02:15:54,312 --> 02:15:58,146
That's not bad. Like a mailman, he would
have a job to do, and he would do it.

2194
02:16:00,118 --> 02:16:02,586
- Your witness.
- Doctor...

2195
02:16:02,687 --> 02:16:05,121
did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2196
02:16:05,223 --> 02:16:07,157
- I did not.
- Any neuroses?

2197
02:16:07,259 --> 02:16:09,193
I found no history of neuroses.

2198
02:16:09,294 --> 02:16:12,263
Any history of delusion?

2199
02:16:12,364 --> 02:16:14,264
- None.
- Loss of memory?

2200
02:16:14,366 --> 02:16:17,494
- Not before this instance.
- Did you find any history...

2201
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:21,936
- Can you spot Mary Pilant?
- She didn't come back after lunch.

2202
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:24,702
I think you'd better give up
on that one.

2203
02:16:24,809 --> 02:16:27,607
Doctor, you stated that the defendant
might or might not...

2204
02:16:27,712 --> 02:16:29,680
have been able to distinguish...

2205
02:16:29,781 --> 02:16:32,511
the difference between right and wrong,
but it wouldn't have made a difference.

2206
02:16:32,617 --> 02:16:34,744
- Am I right? Is that what you said?
- Approximately, yes.

2207
02:16:34,853 --> 02:16:36,787
Did you mean that at the time
of the shooting...

2208
02:16:36,888 --> 02:16:38,753
he could have known the difference
between right and wrong?

2209
02:16:38,857 --> 02:16:40,757
He might have, yes.

2210
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:42,690
Dr. Smith...

2211
02:16:42,794 --> 02:16:45,729
if the defendant could have known
what he was doing...

2212
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:48,264
and could have known it was wrong,
how can you come here...

2213
02:16:48,366 --> 02:16:50,459
and testify that he was legally insane?

2214
02:16:50,569 --> 02:16:53,037
I'm not saying
he was legally insane.

2215
02:16:53,138 --> 02:16:55,072
I'm saying that
in his mental condition...

2216
02:16:55,173 --> 02:16:57,698
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong.

2217
02:16:57,809 --> 02:17:00,369
He would still have shot Quill.

2218
02:17:02,614 --> 02:17:06,448
Are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2219
02:17:06,551 --> 02:17:08,451
Yes, I am.

2220
02:17:09,854 --> 02:17:12,550
Your Honor, I'd like to ask
for a short recess.

2221
02:17:12,657 --> 02:17:16,593
The attorneys for the people would like
to meet with Mr. Biegler in chambers.

2222
02:17:17,495 --> 02:17:20,555
- Glad to oblige, Your Honor.
- Short recess.

2223
02:17:20,665 --> 02:17:22,633
The jury will remain.

2224
02:17:33,812 --> 02:17:35,905
Someday, I'm going to
horrify tradition...

2225
02:17:36,014 --> 02:17:38,505
and lay a dense, blue cloud...

2226
02:17:38,617 --> 02:17:41,711
of tobacco smoke
in that hallowed courtroom.

2227
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:44,084
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2228
02:17:44,189 --> 02:17:46,521
Your Honor, in view of Dr. Smith's
testimony, I thought perhaps...

2229
02:17:46,625 --> 02:17:48,593
the defense might like
to change their plea.

2230
02:17:48,693 --> 02:17:51,491
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2231
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:53,530
No, we'll still go for broke.

2232
02:17:53,632 --> 02:17:56,192
Hell, Paulie, you know a guy's
not considered legally nuts...

2233
02:17:56,301 --> 02:17:58,326
in Michigan unless
he didn't know right from wrong.

2234
02:17:58,436 --> 02:18:02,896
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honor, will you turn to page 486?

2235
02:18:03,008 --> 02:18:07,172
- What's that?
- Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2236
02:18:09,047 --> 02:18:11,072
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

2237
02:18:11,182 --> 02:18:13,707
I make those things
to help me think sometimes.

2238
02:18:13,818 --> 02:18:16,184
- For perch?
- No, it was for frog.

2239
02:18:16,288 --> 02:18:18,222
What case is he citing?

2240
02:18:18,323 --> 02:18:20,518
We gig frogs
in my part of the country.

2241
02:18:20,625 --> 02:18:23,321
It's the same up here.
I'm a trout man, myself...

2242
02:18:23,428 --> 02:18:25,419
but this is a new wrinkle
I'm gonna try.

2243
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:29,432
They do it in the Bayou, down South.
The idea, they get a big, long pole...

2244
02:18:29,534 --> 02:18:31,832
and about a ten-pound line,
just sort of...

2245
02:18:31,936 --> 02:18:33,995
drift along a high bank
in a boat.

2246
02:18:34,105 --> 02:18:38,007
Then you see that big, old bullfrog
in the crevice...

2247
02:18:38,109 --> 02:18:40,202
and sort of float this along
in front of him.

2248
02:18:40,312 --> 02:18:43,042
Pop! That old tongue of his
snaps out, and...

2249
02:18:43,148 --> 02:18:45,116
You've got frog legs
for supper.

2250
02:18:45,216 --> 02:18:47,207
- I'll be darned.
- Why don't you keep it?

2251
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:50,152
- Try it sometime.
- Thanks. I will.

2252
02:18:50,255 --> 02:18:52,189
Four eighty-six.

2253
02:18:53,425 --> 02:18:57,759
- What is it, Your Honor?
- People v. Durfee, 1886.

2254
02:18:57,862 --> 02:19:00,490
Looks like a precedent.

2255
02:19:00,598 --> 02:19:02,589
Would you like to read it?

2256
02:19:03,702 --> 02:19:07,297
No, thank you, Your Honor.
I think I recall the case.

2257
02:19:08,406 --> 02:19:11,239
We're hooked...

2258
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:13,243
like the frog.

2259
02:19:16,247 --> 02:19:18,977
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

2260
02:19:19,050 --> 02:19:20,984
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.

2261
02:19:21,086 --> 02:19:23,145
And where do you practice now?

2262
02:19:23,254 --> 02:19:26,849
I'm the medical superintendent of the
Bonder State Hospital for the Insane.

2263
02:19:26,958 --> 02:19:29,153
It's been stated here that...

2264
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:32,161
dissociative reaction,
or irresistible impulse...

2265
02:19:32,263 --> 02:19:35,096
is not uncommon
among soldiers in combat.

2266
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,930
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do...

2267
02:19:38,036 --> 02:19:40,027
but not as it was put
by Dr. Smith.

2268
02:19:40,138 --> 02:19:43,904
- Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
- Dissociative reaction...

2269
02:19:44,008 --> 02:19:47,739
is not something that comes out of
the blue and disappears as quickly.

2270
02:19:47,846 --> 02:19:52,078
It can only occur,
even among soldiers in combat...

2271
02:19:52,183 --> 02:19:56,119
if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

2272
02:19:56,221 --> 02:19:59,884
It's been testified here that
a psychiatric exam of the defendant...

2273
02:19:59,991 --> 02:20:02,551
showed no evidence of neuroses...

2274
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:04,992
and no history
of dissociative reaction.

2275
02:20:05,096 --> 02:20:07,064
You've further heard it testified...

2276
02:20:07,165 --> 02:20:09,156
that the defendant's behavior
on the night of the shooting...

2277
02:20:09,267 --> 02:20:11,827
was cool and direct.

2278
02:20:11,936 --> 02:20:15,497
As an observer,
do you remember this testimony?

2279
02:20:15,607 --> 02:20:18,838
From this, have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity...

2280
02:20:18,943 --> 02:20:20,877
on the night of the shooting?

2281
02:20:20,979 --> 02:20:24,915
I'm of the opinion that he was in
possession of his faculties...

2282
02:20:25,016 --> 02:20:27,678
so that he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2283
02:20:27,786 --> 02:20:31,620
In other words, he was not
in the grip of irresistible impulse.

2284
02:20:31,723 --> 02:20:33,953
- In my opinion, he was not.
- Thank you. Your witness.

2285
02:20:34,058 --> 02:20:38,051
Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry is an effort
to probe into the dark...

2286
02:20:38,163 --> 02:20:40,131
undiscovered world of the mind.

2287
02:20:40,231 --> 02:20:43,496
And in there, the world
might be round, it could be square.

2288
02:20:43,601 --> 02:20:47,298
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's
could be right. Is that true?

2289
02:20:47,405 --> 02:20:50,067
I'd be a poor doctor
if I didn't agree with that.

2290
02:20:50,175 --> 02:20:53,576
But I believe my opinion
to be right.

2291
02:20:53,678 --> 02:20:56,078
Do you think you might've changed
your opinion...

2292
02:20:56,181 --> 02:20:58,809
if you'd examined the defendant
as Dr. Smith did?

2293
02:20:59,784 --> 02:21:02,014
- I don't believe so.
- But Dr. Smith's opinion...

2294
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:04,213
was made under better circumstances,
wasn't it?

2295
02:21:04,322 --> 02:21:07,348
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2296
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:10,860
- Yeah. Thank you, Doctor.
- That's all, Dr. Harcourt.

2297
02:21:10,962 --> 02:21:14,830
- Is there more rebuttal?
- We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2298
02:21:14,933 --> 02:21:17,527
We have to use him.

2299
02:21:17,635 --> 02:21:20,263
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2300
02:21:20,371 --> 02:21:22,396
Will the sheriff please
bring in the witness?

2301
02:21:29,013 --> 02:21:31,379
What can he tell?

2302
02:21:31,483 --> 02:21:34,043
Nothing.

2303
02:21:34,152 --> 02:21:36,052
He can't tell anything.

2304
02:21:46,898 --> 02:21:50,265
Raise your right hand. Do you swear
the testimony you give in this cause...

2305
02:21:50,368 --> 02:21:53,337
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2306
02:21:53,438 --> 02:21:55,338
I do.

2307
02:21:57,308 --> 02:22:01,608
- State your name, please.
- Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.

2308
02:22:01,713 --> 02:22:03,613
Where do you presently reside?

2309
02:22:03,715 --> 02:22:05,774
Across the alley in the jail.

2310
02:22:05,884 --> 02:22:08,079
You know the defendant,
Frederick Manion?

2311
02:22:08,186 --> 02:22:11,019
Yeah, I got to know him in the past
few weeks. His cell's next to mine.

2312
02:22:11,122 --> 02:22:13,590
What was the last conversation
you had with the lieutenant?

2313
02:22:13,691 --> 02:22:17,286
Except for "hello" this morning,
the last time was last night.

2314
02:22:17,395 --> 02:22:21,058
- Did you discuss his trial last night?
- Yeah, some.

2315
02:22:21,165 --> 02:22:24,225
Would you tell the court what Lt. Manion
had to say about the trial?

2316
02:22:24,335 --> 02:22:27,827
Well, I said,
"Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2317
02:22:27,939 --> 02:22:30,840
And he said,
"I got it made, buster."

2318
02:22:30,942 --> 02:22:33,604
He said,
"I fooled my lawyer...

2319
02:22:33,711 --> 02:22:35,338
I fooled that head-shrinker...

2320
02:22:35,446 --> 02:22:38,006
and I'm gonna fool
that bunch of corn cobs on the jury."

2321
02:22:38,116 --> 02:22:41,779
Liar!
You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!

2322
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:45,621
Take it easy, now.

2323
02:22:45,723 --> 02:22:48,590
I apologize for my client,
Your Honor.

2324
02:22:48,693 --> 02:22:52,390
Yet his outburst is almost excusable,
since the prosecution has seen fit...

2325
02:22:52,497 --> 02:22:56,092
to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the U.S. Army.

2326
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:00,569
Your Honor, I don't know who's the
worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.

2327
02:23:00,672 --> 02:23:03,038
We're close to the end.

2328
02:23:03,141 --> 02:23:05,632
In the name of heaven,
let's have peace...

2329
02:23:05,743 --> 02:23:08,678
and courtesy
for these last few hours.

2330
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:13,410
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2331
02:23:13,518 --> 02:23:16,851
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off
at every opportunity.

2332
02:23:16,955 --> 02:23:19,947
And the defendant will remain seated
in his chair and keep his mouth shut.

2333
02:23:20,058 --> 02:23:22,652
- Now go ahead.
- Mr. Miller...

2334
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:25,456
are you certain
that Lt. Manion said...

2335
02:23:25,563 --> 02:23:27,758
"I've got it made, buster"?

2336
02:23:27,865 --> 02:23:30,629
- That's what he said.
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?

2337
02:23:30,735 --> 02:23:33,203
Yes, sir. He said when he got out...

2338
02:23:33,304 --> 02:23:35,738
the first thing he was gonna do
was kick that bitch...

2339
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,638
from here to kingdom come.

2340
02:23:38,743 --> 02:23:41,541
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2341
02:23:42,647 --> 02:23:44,137
Your witness.

2342
02:23:45,149 --> 02:23:47,549
- What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.

2343
02:23:47,652 --> 02:23:49,643
I copped out,
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2344
02:23:49,754 --> 02:23:51,745
How many other offenses
have you committed?

2345
02:23:51,856 --> 02:23:55,155
I was in reform school as a kid,
but that's all.

2346
02:23:55,259 --> 02:23:58,194
Your Honor, I'd like to see
this man's criminal record.

2347
02:23:58,296 --> 02:24:00,423
Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?

2348
02:24:00,531 --> 02:24:02,863
Yes, sir.

2349
02:24:02,967 --> 02:24:05,128
Here it is.

2350
02:24:07,438 --> 02:24:10,168
Your record shows you've been
in prison six times...

2351
02:24:10,274 --> 02:24:12,799
in three different states...

2352
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:16,368
three times for arson, twice for assault
with a deadly weapon...

2353
02:24:16,481 --> 02:24:18,381
once for larceny.

2354
02:24:20,485 --> 02:24:23,420
Also shows you've done short stretches
in four city jails...

2355
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:26,115
on charges of indecent exposure...

2356
02:24:26,224 --> 02:24:28,351
window-peeping, perjury...

2357
02:24:28,459 --> 02:24:31,360
and disorderly conduct.

2358
02:24:31,462 --> 02:24:34,260
Is this your true record?

2359
02:24:34,365 --> 02:24:36,128
Them things are never right.

2360
02:24:36,234 --> 02:24:38,532
How did you get the ear
of the prosecution...

2361
02:24:38,636 --> 02:24:41,935
in order to tell them about the
conversation you had with Lt. Manion?

2362
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:45,032
- The D.A. Was taking us into his office.
- Taking who into his office?

2363
02:24:45,143 --> 02:24:48,442
- Us prisoners in the jail.
- All at once, or one at a time?

2364
02:24:48,546 --> 02:24:51,413
One at a time.
Him and that other lawyer...

2365
02:24:51,516 --> 02:24:55,475
took us to his office and asked us
questions about Lt. Manion.

2366
02:24:55,586 --> 02:24:58,851
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand?

2367
02:24:58,956 --> 02:25:02,050
- Your Honor, the people object to...
- Overruled. Answer the question.

2368
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:05,652
- I wasn't promised anything.
- You thought it'd help your troubles...

2369
02:25:05,763 --> 02:25:08,095
if you dreamed up this story
to please the D.A.

2370
02:25:08,199 --> 02:25:11,066
- I didn't dream up nothin'.
- You're sure that's what Manion said?

2371
02:25:11,169 --> 02:25:14,263
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- As sure as you were about your record?

2372
02:25:14,372 --> 02:25:16,932
Well, I guess I kind of goofed
on that one.

2373
02:25:19,444 --> 02:25:21,935
Your Honor,
I don't feel I can dignify...

2374
02:25:22,046 --> 02:25:24,606
this creature with any more questions.

2375
02:25:24,716 --> 02:25:27,150
Take the witness away.

2376
02:25:27,285 --> 02:25:29,344
Would you like a conference
with your client?

2377
02:25:29,454 --> 02:25:32,582
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2378
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:34,954
No, Your Honor.
We don't need a conference.

2379
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:37,619
I'll recall Lt. Manion
to the stand right now.

2380
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:48,998
Now, you've heard the testimony
of this Miller.

2381
02:25:50,241 --> 02:25:52,709
- Is any part of it true?
- None.

2382
02:25:53,978 --> 02:25:58,210
Lieutenant, do you have any idea why he
might come here with a tale like that?

2383
02:25:58,316 --> 02:26:00,216
No, sir.

2384
02:26:01,753 --> 02:26:04,051
Have you ever talked with this man?

2385
02:26:05,923 --> 02:26:07,720
What did you talk about?

2386
02:26:09,794 --> 02:26:11,955
Nothing important.

2387
02:26:12,063 --> 02:26:15,624
Certainly, nothing about
my personal life or my feelings.

2388
02:26:15,733 --> 02:26:17,792
That's all I wanted to know.

2389
02:26:17,902 --> 02:26:20,530
Lt. Manion...

2390
02:26:20,638 --> 02:26:23,664
have you ever had
any sort of...

2391
02:26:23,775 --> 02:26:26,141
trouble with Miller?

2392
02:26:27,145 --> 02:26:29,875
I don't know. What do you mean?
An argument? Something like that?

2393
02:26:29,981 --> 02:26:33,781
Did you ever attack...
physically attack him?

2394
02:26:35,119 --> 02:26:37,587
Your lawyer can't answer
the question for you, Lieutenant.

2395
02:26:37,688 --> 02:26:42,318
- Did you ever physically attack Miller?
- I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.

2396
02:26:42,426 --> 02:26:44,451
I pushed his head
against the bars one day.

2397
02:26:44,562 --> 02:26:47,656
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.

2398
02:26:47,765 --> 02:26:51,360
Do you remember pushing or bumping
his head against the bars?

2399
02:26:51,469 --> 02:26:53,596
Sure. I just told you.

2400
02:26:53,704 --> 02:26:56,138
Then this was not
dissociative reaction.

2401
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:58,765
The defendant isn't qualified
to answer that.

2402
02:26:58,876 --> 02:27:01,003
Lt. Manion...

2403
02:27:01,112 --> 02:27:03,444
wasn't your action against Barney Quill
much the same...

2404
02:27:03,548 --> 02:27:06,142
as your action against Miller
and against the lieutenant...

2405
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:08,480
that you struck
at the cocktail party?

2406
02:27:08,586 --> 02:27:13,114
All in the heat of anger with a willful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2407
02:27:13,224 --> 02:27:15,454
I don't remember
my action against Quill.

2408
02:27:16,694 --> 02:27:20,130
How long had you known that your wife
was running around with Barney Quill?

2409
02:27:21,566 --> 02:27:24,433
I never knew anything like that.

2410
02:27:24,535 --> 02:27:26,127
I trust my wife.

2411
02:27:27,405 --> 02:27:30,033
I suppose you just beat her up
occasionally for the fun of it.

2412
02:27:30,141 --> 02:27:33,406
Nothing has been established
to permit a question like that.

2413
02:27:33,511 --> 02:27:35,638
He keeps implying things
without getting to the point.

2414
02:27:35,746 --> 02:27:39,079
Let him ask the lieutenant,
did he ever beat his wife?

2415
02:27:39,183 --> 02:27:41,048
I'll sustain the objection.

2416
02:27:41,152 --> 02:27:43,677
Would you like to rephrase
your question, Mr. Dancer?

2417
02:27:45,389 --> 02:27:47,516
No thank you, Your Honor.

2418
02:27:47,625 --> 02:27:49,525
I've finished.

2419
02:27:49,627 --> 02:27:52,892
Then I'll ask him.
Did you, Lt. Manion...

2420
02:27:52,997 --> 02:27:56,125
ever beat your wife on the night
of the shooting or any other time?

2421
02:27:56,234 --> 02:27:58,168
- No, sir.
- Is there any doubt in your mind...

2422
02:27:58,269 --> 02:28:00,669
that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2423
02:28:00,771 --> 02:28:02,671
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2424
02:28:02,773 --> 02:28:05,173
Step down, Lieutenant.

2425
02:28:10,281 --> 02:28:12,841
- We hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2426
02:28:18,789 --> 02:28:22,555
Your Honor, I know time is pressing.
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2427
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:24,594
I would like to leave
the courtroom for a moment.

2428
02:28:24,695 --> 02:28:27,255
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2429
02:28:27,365 --> 02:28:29,697
Thank you, sir.

2430
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:32,268
This is highly irregular,
Your Honor.

2431
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:35,168
There's no reason to make
a federal case out of it.

2432
02:28:46,784 --> 02:28:50,220
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2433
02:28:50,321 --> 02:28:52,619
The defense calls Mary Pilant
to the stand.

2434
02:28:52,723 --> 02:28:54,816
We must protest this whole affair.

2435
02:28:54,926 --> 02:28:57,759
The noble defense attorney rushes out
to a secret conference...

2436
02:28:57,862 --> 02:29:00,831
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle.

2437
02:29:00,932 --> 02:29:03,958
The whole thing has obviously been
rigged to unduly excite the jury.

2438
02:29:04,068 --> 02:29:06,536
It's another cornball trick.

2439
02:29:06,637 --> 02:29:09,902
Your Honor, I don't blame Mr. Dancer
for feeling put-upon.

2440
02:29:10,007 --> 02:29:12,976
I'm just a humble country lawyer
trying to do the best I can...

2441
02:29:13,077 --> 02:29:16,478
against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2442
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:18,946
Swear the witness.

2443
02:29:19,050 --> 02:29:22,850
Raise your right hand. Do you swear
the testimony you shall give...

2444
02:29:22,954 --> 02:29:26,754
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2445
02:29:26,857 --> 02:29:28,757
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2446
02:29:31,929 --> 02:29:34,921
- Where do you live, Miss Pilant?
- At Thunder Bay Inn in Thunder Bay.

2447
02:29:35,032 --> 02:29:38,297
- And how long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2448
02:29:38,402 --> 02:29:41,371
- And what's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2449
02:29:41,472 --> 02:29:46,102
Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundry
handled at Thunder Bay Inn?

2450
02:29:46,210 --> 02:29:48,144
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2451
02:29:48,245 --> 02:29:50,941
Where is the location of that chute
on the second floor?

2452
02:29:51,048 --> 02:29:54,575
- Between room 42 and 43.
- Who lives in those rooms?

2453
02:29:54,685 --> 02:29:58,348
I live in 42.
Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2454
02:29:58,456 --> 02:30:00,924
Would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2455
02:30:01,025 --> 02:30:05,724
have to pass by the mouth of that chute
on the way to his room?

2456
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:10,324
Would it be very easy for him to drop
something into that chute as he passed?

2457
02:30:10,434 --> 02:30:14,302
Have you ever had occasion to go
down into the laundry at any time?

2458
02:30:14,405 --> 02:30:17,704
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2459
02:30:17,808 --> 02:30:20,299
as they come out of
the wash-and-dry machine.

2460
02:30:20,411 --> 02:30:23,380
Would you tell the court what you found
among those pieces of laundry...

2461
02:30:23,481 --> 02:30:25,972
the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2462
02:30:26,083 --> 02:30:28,313
I found a pair of women's panties.

2463
02:30:28,419 --> 02:30:31,388
- And what did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2464
02:30:31,489 --> 02:30:34,822
When did you learn the significance
of those panties?

2465
02:30:34,925 --> 02:30:37,860
Here.
This morning, in the courtroom.

2466
02:30:37,962 --> 02:30:40,522
And then you went home
and got them out of the rag bin?

2467
02:30:40,631 --> 02:30:42,599
Did you bring them with you?

2468
02:30:45,803 --> 02:30:49,136
I offer this article of lingerie...

2469
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:51,572
as Exhibit Number One
for the defense.

2470
02:30:51,675 --> 02:30:55,907
They're white,
they have lace up the side...

2471
02:30:56,013 --> 02:30:58,277
and they're badly torn...

2472
02:30:58,382 --> 02:31:02,113
as if they've been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2473
02:31:02,219 --> 02:31:04,153
The label reads...

2474
02:31:05,589 --> 02:31:08,183
"Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2475
02:31:08,292 --> 02:31:11,625
If there is no objection, the exhibit
will be received in evidence.

2476
02:31:11,729 --> 02:31:14,823
- That's all, Miss Pilant.
- Do you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick...

2477
02:31:14,932 --> 02:31:16,866
about the death of Barney Quill?

2478
02:31:16,967 --> 02:31:19,902
He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2479
02:31:20,004 --> 02:31:23,303
Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't
believe Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2480
02:31:23,407 --> 02:31:27,707
- Yes, I told him that.
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?

2481
02:31:27,812 --> 02:31:30,713
Was this also in connection
with the shooting of Quill?

2482
02:31:30,815 --> 02:31:33,545
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2483
02:31:33,651 --> 02:31:35,881
- How many times did you talk to him?
- Twice.

2484
02:31:35,986 --> 02:31:38,181
- When was the last time?
- Last night.

2485
02:31:38,289 --> 02:31:40,587
And have you now changed your mind?
Do you now believe...

2486
02:31:40,691 --> 02:31:42,955
Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2487
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:45,119
I don't know now.
I think he might have.

2488
02:31:45,229 --> 02:31:47,288
When did you change your mind?
Last night?

2489
02:31:47,398 --> 02:31:50,265
- No, it was here, this morning.
- When were you given the panties?

2490
02:31:50,367 --> 02:31:52,562
- Was that last night?
- Just wait a minute!

2491
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:55,537
Use the proper form
of objection, Mr. Biegler.

2492
02:31:55,639 --> 02:31:59,632
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2493
02:31:59,743 --> 02:32:02,234
- The witness may answer.
- No.

2494
02:32:02,346 --> 02:32:05,179
I was not given the panties last night
or at any other time.

2495
02:32:05,282 --> 02:32:08,115
- I found them exactly as I said.
- Do you know for a fact...

2496
02:32:08,219 --> 02:32:11,086
that Barney Quill dropped the panties
down the chute, or did you assume it?

2497
02:32:11,188 --> 02:32:13,122
- I assumed it.
- Had you thought maybe someone else...

2498
02:32:13,224 --> 02:32:16,682
might have put the panties there
who wanted them found in the laundry?

2499
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:18,694
I hadn't thought of that.

2500
02:32:18,796 --> 02:32:22,630
And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call irresistible impulse...

2501
02:32:22,733 --> 02:32:25,361
you rushed in here with the panties
because you wanted to crucify...

2502
02:32:25,469 --> 02:32:27,369
the dead Barney Quill,
isn't that true?

2503
02:32:27,471 --> 02:32:30,440
- No, I thought it was my duty...
- Your pride was hurt, wasn't it?

2504
02:32:30,541 --> 02:32:33,476
- I don't know what you mean.
- He's trying to confuse the witness.

2505
02:32:33,577 --> 02:32:36,045
Let him ask her a question
she can understand.

2506
02:32:36,147 --> 02:32:40,140
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I myself would like
to know what you're driving at.

2507
02:32:40,251 --> 02:32:43,584
Miss Pilant,
when you found the panties...

2508
02:32:43,687 --> 02:32:46,918
was your first thought that Barney Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2509
02:32:47,024 --> 02:32:50,926
or was it that he might have been
stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2510
02:32:51,028 --> 02:32:53,087
I don't know what he means.

2511
02:32:53,197 --> 02:32:57,759
Mr. Dancer, once again I must ask you to
put straight questions to the witness.

2512
02:32:57,868 --> 02:33:01,304
Here is a straight question,
Your Honor.

2513
02:33:01,405 --> 02:33:04,067
Miss Pilant, are you
Barney Quill's mistress?

2514
02:33:04,175 --> 02:33:06,075
No. No, I was not!

2515
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:08,168
It's common knowledge in Thunder Bay
you were living with Quill.

2516
02:33:08,279 --> 02:33:12,648
- That's not true. Barney Quill was...
- Was what, Miss Pilant?

2517
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:19,581
Barney Quill was my father.

2518
02:33:31,035 --> 02:33:33,162
No more questions.

2519
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:35,170
That's all for me.

2520
02:33:35,272 --> 02:33:38,173
The witness may step down.

2521
02:33:38,275 --> 02:33:40,869
We will recess for 15 minutes,
after which...

2522
02:33:40,978 --> 02:33:43,276
we will hear the closing arguments.

2523
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:47,441
If possible, I would like to charge
the jury before nightfall.

2524
02:34:03,534 --> 02:34:05,968
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2525
02:34:20,884 --> 02:34:23,444
Can't somebody say something?

2526
02:34:25,256 --> 02:34:27,747
What do you want me
to say, Maida, darling?

2527
02:34:27,858 --> 02:34:31,089
Tell me we're gonna win.

2528
02:34:31,195 --> 02:34:35,131
I'm counting on getting that
promissory note from the lieutenant.

2529
02:34:35,232 --> 02:34:39,396
I hope I can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.

2530
02:34:39,503 --> 02:34:43,701
Half the time, the "p" and the "f"
don't strike on mine.

2531
02:34:43,807 --> 02:34:46,401
"Party of the first part"
sometimes comes out...

2532
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:49,001
"arty of the irst art."

2533
02:34:49,113 --> 02:34:51,843
Doesn't make sense.
It's embarrassing.

2534
02:34:51,949 --> 02:34:54,315
"Arty of the irst art"?

2535
02:34:54,418 --> 02:34:56,545
I kind of like that.

2536
02:34:56,654 --> 02:34:58,781
Has a ring to it.

2537
02:35:01,692 --> 02:35:04,388
Twelve people go off
into a room.

2538
02:35:05,896 --> 02:35:09,832
Twelve different minds,
twelve different hearts...

2539
02:35:09,933 --> 02:35:13,300
and twelve different walks of life.

2540
02:35:13,404 --> 02:35:17,306
Twelve sets of eyes, ears,
shapes and sizes.

2541
02:35:17,408 --> 02:35:20,309
And these twelve people...

2542
02:35:20,411 --> 02:35:23,505
are asked to judge
another human being...

2543
02:35:23,614 --> 02:35:27,050
as different from them
as they are from each other.

2544
02:35:27,151 --> 02:35:30,712
And in their judgment,
they must become of one mind.

2545
02:35:30,821 --> 02:35:33,551
Unanimous.

2546
02:35:33,657 --> 02:35:37,559
That's one of the miracles of man's
disorganized soul that they can do it.

2547
02:35:39,096 --> 02:35:41,189
And most instances,
do it right well.

2548
02:35:43,167 --> 02:35:46,034
God bless juries.

2549
02:35:47,271 --> 02:35:49,933
I don't know what I'd do
if I were on that jury.

2550
02:35:53,577 --> 02:35:55,477
I really don't know.

2551
02:35:56,914 --> 02:35:58,142
Do you?

2552
02:36:02,986 --> 02:36:04,886
I loved that, Paulie.

2553
02:36:04,988 --> 02:36:08,890
I loved that
"humble country lawyer" bit.

2554
02:36:08,992 --> 02:36:12,120
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2555
02:36:12,229 --> 02:36:14,129
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.

2556
02:36:14,231 --> 02:36:16,563
That's the best summary I've ever heard
in a courtroom.

2557
02:36:16,667 --> 02:36:19,568
I liked yours much better, Paulie.

2558
02:36:24,508 --> 02:36:27,341
Do you have to play that stuff?
Can't you play "Danny Boy"...

2559
02:36:27,444 --> 02:36:29,537
or "Sweet Isle of Innisfree"?

2560
02:36:43,627 --> 02:36:47,757
Paul Biegler's office.
Yes, sir. Right away.

2561
02:36:47,865 --> 02:36:49,765
They're ready.

2562
02:36:59,443 --> 02:37:01,604
Hey, sweetie.

2563
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:05,442
Go on.

2564
02:37:05,549 --> 02:37:07,642
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

2565
02:37:07,751 --> 02:37:10,720
You can tell my loving husband
I'll be waiting in the car.

2566
02:37:10,821 --> 02:37:13,915
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Oh, sure!

2567
02:37:14,024 --> 02:37:17,585
He's lucky.
Some people have all the luck.

2568
02:37:17,694 --> 02:37:22,256
You can tell him I'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2569
02:37:22,366 --> 02:37:24,334
Oh! Hey, sweetie...

2570
02:37:24,435 --> 02:37:26,903
I have a souvenir for you.

2571
02:37:28,338 --> 02:37:30,329
You'd better keep that thing.

2572
02:37:30,441 --> 02:37:33,035
You might need it again sometime.
You never know.

2573
02:37:33,143 --> 02:37:35,270
No, you don't, do you?

2574
02:37:35,379 --> 02:37:37,609
Oh, I like you, Paulie.

2575
02:37:44,354 --> 02:37:48,154
I warn all those present not
to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2576
02:37:48,258 --> 02:37:50,726
I will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

2577
02:37:50,828 --> 02:37:53,194
if there is any demonstration.

2578
02:38:02,139 --> 02:38:04,130
Proceed, Mr. Clerk.

2579
02:38:04,241 --> 02:38:06,801
Members of the jury,
have you agreed upon a verdict...

2580
02:38:06,910 --> 02:38:10,311
- and if so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.

2581
02:38:10,414 --> 02:38:12,314
The defendant will rise.

2582
02:38:15,152 --> 02:38:17,450
- What is your verdict?
- We find the defendant...

2583
02:38:17,554 --> 02:38:19,988
not guilty by reason of insanity.

2584
02:38:25,662 --> 02:38:27,960
Maida gave you that promissory note,
didn't she?

2585
02:38:28,065 --> 02:38:30,625
Right here, ready to be signed
by our happy client.

2586
02:38:32,135 --> 02:38:35,764
You know, I used to think the world
looked better through a glass of whisky.

2587
02:38:35,873 --> 02:38:38,137
It doesn't.

2588
02:38:38,242 --> 02:38:40,972
I think I'll keep it this way.
Looks nice.

2589
02:38:42,212 --> 02:38:45,409
Well, I got one good thing
out of this case...

2590
02:38:45,516 --> 02:38:49,475
a new law partner,
if it's all right with him.

2591
02:38:49,586 --> 02:38:53,044
He'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

2592
02:39:23,253 --> 02:39:26,518
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion,
aren't you, Mr. Biegler?

2593
02:39:26,623 --> 02:39:28,614
He gave me this note for you.

2594
02:39:30,193 --> 02:39:34,220
I felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.
She was crying.

2595
02:39:34,331 --> 02:39:37,994
Left a mess, didn't they?
Well, we'd better get busy here.

2596
02:39:38,101 --> 02:39:42,037
"Dear Mr. Biegler,
so sorry that I had to leave suddenly.

2597
02:39:42,139 --> 02:39:45,074
I was seized
by an irresistible impulse.

2598
02:39:45,175 --> 02:39:47,735
Frederick Manion."

2599
02:39:47,844 --> 02:39:50,472
How in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

2600
02:39:52,082 --> 02:39:56,075
Gin. I knew there was
something wrong with that guy.

2601
02:39:56,186 --> 02:39:58,518
Never saw a gin drinker yet
you could trust.

2602
02:40:00,023 --> 02:40:03,015
Partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

2603
02:40:03,126 --> 02:40:05,321
- Who might that be?
- Mary Pilant.

2604
02:40:05,429 --> 02:40:07,920
We're gonna administer
Barney Quill's estate.

2605
02:40:08,031 --> 02:40:11,467
Now, that's what I call
poetic justice for everybody.

2606
02:40:32,001 --> 02:40:33,467
