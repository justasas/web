00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:12,390
- Jade, wait up!
- Come on, hurry!

9
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,855
- I'm coming!
- He'll  be here any second!

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,124
Haven't you ever ditched before?

11
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,877
Not really.

12
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:24,539
Well, at least we had fun.

13
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,135
Yeah, I know.

14
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,637
Is your sister's boyfriend cool?

15
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:31,555
- He doesn't say much.
- Well, what's he like?

16
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,284
I don't know.  He's not
from around here though.

17
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,220
Ah, Shit!  He's here!

18
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,160
Cool car!

19
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:56,659
I know.

20
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:00,494
- So where are we taking you?
- It's just up this way.

21
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,447
Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:13,877
Bye, Megan.

23
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:23,887
So how was your first day
at school, Jade?

24
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,902
Fine.

25
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:27,956
Like your teacher?

26
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,061
I have more than one, you know?

27
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,658
Mmm..so what's
your favorite subject?

28
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:37,180
- History.
- History?

29
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:42,147
Very good!
You see, it's my favorite too.

30
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,816
Why do you like
to take pictures?

31
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:54,819
- Because pictures never lie.
- What does that mean?

32
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:59,919
The frame of a 35mm camera is alive.
It lasts for ever.

33
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,922
Unlike people.

34
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:05,071
Nothing lasts for ever.

35
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:08,012
What happens to you
when you die?

36
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,266
I don't know.
I guess you just rot away.

37
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,134
And you believe that?

38
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,303
Yeah, I guess....

39
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:20,259
Remind me to take your picture sometime.

40
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,146
Why?   You never take pictures of my sister.

41
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,539
Don't worry.
I will.

42
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:33,937
Hi Benny!

43
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,771
Hi!

44
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:37,593
Well, tell me all about it!

45
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:41,618
I will later.
-Now stop that!  Go back into that chair!

46
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,973
I haven't seen your sister
in three months.

47
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:50,365
She's getting to be
quite a big girl!

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,239
- Nah, she's still just a little squirt.
- I am not!

49
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,258
Seen any cute guys?

50
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,457
Well, listen to you
miss matchmaker over there!

51
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:01,116
A couple.  But they were
a little too old for you, Candy.

52
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,746
You little shit!

53
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:05,613
- Where's your ride?
- He's out parking his car.

54
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:09,114
You mean your ride,
don't you Charlotte?

55
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,638
You watch your mouth!

56
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,947
Charlotte's dating a German prince!

57
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:22,484
- Really?
- Yes, I chide you  not!

58
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,070
Don't be jealous!

59
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:26,800
- Hi, how are you?
- Great!

60
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,383
I was just talking
to Jade about her school.

61
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:33,406
You got to be more careful
little girl!

62
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:38,011
Was she complaining?

63
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,951
No,  not at all.

64
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:43,206
Well, maybe she can tell
us all about it over dinner.

65
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:45,218
Oh, not tonight. I have
to shoot some girls.

66
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,897
- Are theypretty?
- Of course they're pretty!

67
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:51,618
- As pretty as me?
- Never as pretty as you!

68
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,919
[Series of breaths interspersed
with ever louder screams]

69
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:55,553
What do you see in him?
He's a big klutz who carries
around a stupid camera.

70
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:56,883
Jade, stop it!

71
00:08:56,918 --> 00:09:00,192
I can't believe you went out
and bought a pair of shoes just for him!

72
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,926
He's no fun, and he looks at me weird!

73
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:06,970
He's not weird just because
he's not from around here
and he has different ways.

74
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,295
You're always complaining that he's
never around and he never returns your calls.

75
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,340
Do you know how many guys
would love to go out with you?

76
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,649
Come on Jade,
I don't want to hear now this right now!

77
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,063
I don't like the way he talks to you.

78
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,910
Why do you love him,
he doesn't love you?

79
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,892
Then why did he give me
a key to his house?

80
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,665
It's probably a fake!

81
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,349
Listen, I just have a
really bad feeling about him, OK?

82
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:29,320
You and your feelings!
You know, you're not always right!

83
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,123
I am this time!
He thinks he's better than everybody else!
I mean...

84
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:33,901
look at the way he talks:

85
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:36,793
'Hi, I am from Germany,
and I wear tight pants...

86
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:41,933
and I think I am so cool because I take pictures of
naked girls with my stupid camera.'

87
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:44,181
What I am going to do with you, huh?

88
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:14,879
This wine is really good!

89
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,505
So Jade, how was school today?

90
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,037
There's no school on a Saturday.

91
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:27,938
Of course!

92
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,711
Forgive me!  I think hard and I work late.

93
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,447
It's all right!

94
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:46,746
Do you always eat
your meat that bloody?

95
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,695
Yes,  blood is good!

96
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,182
It's good for you.

97
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,956
Blood contains iron...

98
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,219
and you need iron to
replace your blood cells.

99
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:06,592
See, that's the problem with women.
Women have an iron deficiency.

100
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:07,593
[Laughs]

101
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,805
Among others things.

102
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:16,120
And, women need more iron than men.

103
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,483
It's ironic…

104
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:29,932
Women suck blood
out of men every day.

105
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,602
But at the end of every month…

106
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:35,064
…it leaks out!

107
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:42,237
It's just punishment.

108
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,591
So want some ice cream tonight?

109
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,294
That sounds great!

110
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:58,250
I have to use the bathroom first.

111
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,620
Where is my sister?

112
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,410
In the bathroom.

113
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:45,801
Where you're supposed to be.

114
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,868
Last time we talked about your school...

115
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,524
you said something about history.

116
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,511
Well, this is my history.

117
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,039
He was my grandfather.

118
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,709
He was a hero, you know.

119
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,872
He fought the bad guys
during the Second World War.

120
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:29,339
Yeah...    but…

121
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:31,973
Wasn't he German?

122
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,774
[Sound of engine accelerating]

123
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,475
[Sound of win and coins dropping]

124
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,515
Boy, aren't you the luck one?

125
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:13,523
- Tell me your name!
- Andrea, silly!

126
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,523
Of course!

127
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,779
-A nice big smile!
-OK.

128
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,288
Very good!

129
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:42,910
I...  You really are very beautiful.

130
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,198
Why, thank you!

131
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,902
Are you OK?

132
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:07,803
Excuse me...be right back.

133
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:09,610
OK.

134
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:56,015
OK...you promise that you won't say anything?

135
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,816
[Sounds of shutter clicking repeatedly]

136
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,962
She told Candy that
he wouldn't even fuck her.

137
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:09,278
- That's weird!
- Yeah, I know!

138
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:17,448
- His grandfather was a Nazi.
- A Nazi?

139
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:20,376
A Nazi, like in
World War II.

140
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:25,876
Nazis, like Adolf Hitler and Germany
and that weird cross thing they had to wear.

141
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,226
How do you know that?

142
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,605
I saw a picture of him
plus, he told me.

143
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,457
And when I told Charlotte about it,
she said that I was just exaggerating.

144
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,641
So, what are you going to do about it?

145
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,045
He just freaks me out.
Charlotte's never going to listen to me.

146
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,183
It's just like that last asshole she went out with.

147
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:43,327
She'll always let guys walk all over her.

148
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,376
Well, your sister's smart,
she's going to jump in....

149
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:49,047
Well maybe, but...
I just don't see him going away.

[Car engine-varying pitch over time]

You're late!

156
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,171
As usual.

157
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:41,738
Man, this hemi has been
giving me fits.

158
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,353
But then, you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

159
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:55,101
Maybe I'll just find myself
a young girl and pimp her out...

160
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,490
then I could afford to buy such a car.

161
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,608
You don't have a daughter, do you?

162
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:01,444
I don't think so.

163
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:05,211
Can't everybody be as lucky as me.

164
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,647
Or as pretty.

165
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,204
Let's go in the house.

166
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,974
Have a seat.  I'll be a minute.

167
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:39,697
Let's go to the bedroom.

I'll bet you that old girl in there
has already got her panites off.

172
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,218
For an extra $500. I'll walk
down to 7-11 and buy another 12 pack

173
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,338
And drink it there .

174
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,640
I gotta shoot some
girls tonight.
