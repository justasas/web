1
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:20,586


2
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,118
People ought to be
ashamed of themselves.

3
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,385
Kicking up
all that racket

4
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,820
at this time of night.

5
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,710
What is it?

6
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,911
Is it a fire?

7
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,216
Well, why can't they
knock quietly?

8
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,553
Oh, blast it.
We never...

9
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,222
It's about
3 doors down.

10
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,528
That's where
Diana Baring is staying.

11
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,664
There's a policeman
coming over I think.

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,200
Well, just coming
around the corner.

13
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,402
Well, that's funny.
I could've sworn.

14
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,537
No, you're right.
Look. There he is.

15
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,573
Coming down the side
of the road.

16
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,944
That's
Druce knocking.

17
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,213
Looks as though
he's tight again.

18
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,282
Here. Here.
Where's my shoes?

19
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,950
I better get down.

20
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,619
Aye. I'm on my way.

21
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,294
What, at this
time of night?

22
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,231
My wife Edna!

23
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:24,269
...with Diana Baring.

24
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,671
She's a--

25
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:28,340
yeah, wait for me.
I'm coming.

26
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,376
I gotta go see what's
the matter with Druce.

27
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,279
Say, what's the matter,
mr. Druce? Anything wrong?

28
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,316
Will you please
take this man away?

29
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,751
Come along now, Druce,
there's a good fellow.

30
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:40,919
Druce: No. Stop it.

31
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,389
Open this door,
will you?!

32
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,490
Open this door!

33
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,792
Hold on.
One second.

34
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:47,893
Open the door.

35
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,429
Let go. Now,
wait a minute now.

36
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,497
I can't wait to see
what's going to happen.

37
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,267
Open the door
for the love of god!

38
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,303
Open the door,
for god's sake.

39
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,748
One of you run
down to the station

40
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,483
and ask the inspector
to come along.

41
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,318
Tell him it's serious.

42
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,855
Is this woman
a lodger of yours?

43
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,690
No, but miss Baring is.

44
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:55,327
And she had mrs. Druce
to supper with her tonight.

45
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,062
As a matter of fact,
it was about--

46
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,364
well, you see,
mr. constable,

47
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,400
both these ladies are,
I mean were

48
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:05,837
that's playing at the theatre
royale this week.

49
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,639
And as I was leaving
the theatre,

50
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,940
you see I'm
the stage manager,

51
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,310
and mr. Druce here,
he's the general manager.

52
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,445
Well, you see, when I left
the theatre tonight,

53
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,646
I was invited
to join them.

54
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,415
Wait. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

55
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,016
One at a time, please.

56
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,351
They killed
you, Edna.

57
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,319
They killed you.

58
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,420
Tell me, darling.

59
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:25,424
Who, darling?
Did she do it?

60
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,496
You always
hated Edna.

61
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,566
Thought yourself
too good for us...

62
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:39,338
With your high and
mighty ladylike ways.

63
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,907
Now, pull yourself
together.

64
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,677
Ohh! Leave me alone.

65
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:50,015
Is there any
brandy in the house?

66
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,786
You'll find some brandy
in the flask on the table.

67
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,390
I was just giving
some to Edna when...

68
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,691
When...

69
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,427
I can't think.

70
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,930
I can't remember.

71
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,870
Well, there's none
there. It's empty.

72
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,905
I'll run back
and fetch some.

73
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,942
Perhaps you'd like
a cup of tea, dear.

74
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,610
It'll warm you up.

75
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,480
I'll go and make it.

76
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,517
I'll give you
a hand, dear.

77
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,457
Shall I light
this gas, dear?

78
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,558
Please, dear.

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,095
It only wants
a drop more in it.

80
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,499
Light the stove,
will you, dear?

81
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,801
I, uh...

82
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:46,605
I suppose mrs. Druce
really is dead,

83
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,174
you know, uh...

84
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:52,177
You know, Diana
never did get on well

85
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,512
with poor Edna Druce,

86
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,746
and I know for a fact

87
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,015
that they hadn't
been on speaking terms

88
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,517
for the last 7 weeks.

89
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,453
Miss Diana said
nothing to me about it.

90
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:05,991
Well, it's a fact. You
can take it from me.

91
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,533
I don't believe
she could have done it,

92
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,637
though there's no denying
she is headstrong.

93
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,704
I should say so.

94
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,773
Why, she gave
in her notice

95
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,974
the other day
over Edna.

96
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,810
Who, miss Diana?

97
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,978
Yes, but, uh...

98
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,448
Druce didn't want
to lose her,

99
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,683
so Edna would've
been glad enough

100
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,984
to see her go.

101
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,120
Then suddenly...

102
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,156
Suddenly, last night,
she changed,

103
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,792
asked if they
could make it up.

104
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,860
Diana was puzzled

105
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,962
but asked her
home to supper.

106
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,131
Now, I can't
help feeling now

107
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,699
that she had
some reason

108
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,468
for getting
Diana here alone.

109
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,237
Of course,
perhaps it's been...

110
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,772
Hot stuff like she is,

111
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,940
she thought
one of her men

112
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,575
was getting too keen
on Diana Baring

113
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,511
and wanted her
out of the way.

114
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,913
What kind of tea
did you use, dear?

115
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,583
Oh, my dear, I've tried
so many kinds,

116
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,185
I don't really remember
which this is.

117
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,054
I'll get the door, right?

118
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:13,592
Open the door, yes,
if you don't mind.

119
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,532
Here. I say,
I've just made tea.

120
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,566
That's all right, ma.

121
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,237
We'll get some down
at the station.

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,635
Third act
beginners, please.

123
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,038
Your call,
miss Baring.

124
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,921
That's
miss Baring's understudy.

125
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,257
There you are, see?
Going on now.

126
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,626
You are
answering the door?

127
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,828
Answer the door?
Of course.

128
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,165
Well, I don't know
where we shall go.

129
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,866
Oh, Tom. Tom.

130
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,636
The inspector would like
to have a word with you.

131
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,905
This is mr. Tom Druid,
inspector.

132
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,674
It's about the
murder, mr. Drake.

133
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,176
Now, there are
one or two points

134
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,745
I suppose you didn't
happen to see

135
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,213
mrs. Druce
and miss Baring

136
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,315
leave the theatre
together last night.

137
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,623
Yes, I did.

138
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,924
As a matter of fact,

139
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:29,194
I remarked to Fane, our
leading man, about it.

140
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,862
He saw them,
as well, you know.

141
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,697
Why? Is it very unusual?

142
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,966
Unusual? I should say so.

143
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,636
It's an absolute miracle.

144
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,005
As I was saying to my wife,

145
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,340
I said, "Annie, we met--"

146
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:46,044
hold on, old boy. My cue.

147
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,264
Say, which of
the 2 women is this?

148
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,732
Mrs. Druid?

149
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,402
Oh. Ha ha ha.

150
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,837
You're unlucky this time,
inspector.

151
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,207
This is Handell Fane,
100% he-woman.

152
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,010
mr. Fane's
our leading man.

153
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,278
I assure you,
inspector,

154
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,780
I'm not
the other woman

155
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,814
in the case.

156
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,915
I know that, mr. Fane,

157
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,050
but I understand you saw

158
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,851
the 2 women together
last night.

159
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,054
Yes, just before
I left the theatre,

160
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,756
then I went straight
to my rooms.

161
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,959
Yes. Well, Ion Stewart
came with me.

162
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,462
He came and he wanted to
borrow some cigarettes.

163
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,398
He'd lost his case
or something,

164
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,867
and then I went
straight to bed.

165
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,803
Say, excuse me, I'm on.

166
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,471
Reginald, darling,

167
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,707
has that cat gone yet?

168
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,343
Ooh, it's you,
cousin Yettie.

169
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:56,448
Don't you dare to try
to run away from me.

170
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,983
Come here when
I speak to you.

171
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,986
No, no, you don't.

172
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:05,023
That's the bathroom.

173
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,458
Come here,

174
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,829
or are you afraid
of a poor, weak woman?

175
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,930
He promised
to meet, dear.

176
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,803
Say, who's that man?

177
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,305
Oh, that's
our heavy lead.

178
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,974
Ion Stewart.
Very sound actor.

179
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,343
Is he married?

180
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,845
How did he get on
with the prisoner?

181
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,980
Excuse me, inspector.

182
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,858
Say, how
did he get on

183
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,826
with the prisoner
miss Baring?

184
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,128
So-so, you know?

185
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,530
Was he popular
with the ladies?

186
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,298
You talking
about the jerk?

187
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,401
He's a bit too popular
if you ask me.

188
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,370
Please, if you could
call her a lady.

189
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,805
Shh. Now,
Doucie, remember,

190
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,773
she's only just dead.

191
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,074
Oh, all right,
all right.

192
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,276
I've never heard yet
that telling the truth

193
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,879
was a disgrace.
Only been one year

194
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,814
about Edna
and Stewart anyhow.

195
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,415
And the way I take it,

196
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,084
mr. Stewart
and mrs. Druce...

197
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,019
Excuse me. My line.

198
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,189
Oh! Don't bother
to show me through.

199
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,557
I know my way.

200
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,393
This is not the first
time, Reginald.

201
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,861
Everything's
going splendid.

202
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,963
Well, perhaps
I ought not to say

203
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,231
Edna and Stewart
like that.

204
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,100
But, Ted, you know
what Edna was like,

205
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,803
anyone she liked
had to be wrote in.

206
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,138
I can't wait
any longer.

207
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,873
Quick! In here!

208
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,076
Excuse me
a minute, inspector.

209
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,279
Shan't be long.
There's a quick change.

210
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,413
How do you do?

211
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,215
No, I'm sorry.
He's not here.

212
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,817
What have
they done with her?

213
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,986
Why, she's down at
the station, I expect.

214
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,955
Did she say anything,
do you know?

215
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,290
Is there anything
I can do?

216
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,192
Markham, you don't
really think

217
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,993
she's done it, do you?

218
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,562
Why have
they arrested her?

219
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,330
Saw it with me own eyes.

220
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,933
She was with the poker
in her hand

221
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,569
just by her side anyway.
Blood. Covered with blood.

222
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,871
Why, what's
the matter with you?

223
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,106
Blood always makes
me feel sick,

224
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,274
even the mention
of it.

225
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,444
Well, that's all right.
Here's your helmet.

226
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,445
Ready?

227
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,257
Yeah.
Hurry up, Markham.

228
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,259
There you are.

229
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,560
Ok?

230
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,095
Yeah.

231
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,101
Yeah. Why not?

232
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,963
Members of the jury,

233
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:03,034
Diana Baring is indicted
and stands charge

234
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,037
with the willful murder
of Edna Druce.

235
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,038
For this indictment,

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,374
she has pleaded
not guilty.

237
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,975
It is your duty
to inquire

238
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,479
whether she
is guilty or not.

239
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,515
I need not remind you

240
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,984
that in the eyes
of the law,

241
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,621
men and women are equal.

242
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,458
The crime of murder
in England, at least,

243
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,328
is judged dispassionately.

244
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:36,000
Neither beauty
nor youth nor provocation

245
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,468
can mitigate...

246
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,271
She gave me
the strangest look.

247
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,007
Half-surprised...

248
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,009
And half-angry.

249
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,045
And she said:

250
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,280
"How dare you!"

251
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,051
And I don't
remember anymore.

252
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,521
I just don't remember.

253
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:06,531
Must have happened when
I was not conscious of myself.

254
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,702
That's all I can say.

255
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,738
Our defense is
a complete denial

256
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,573
of all responsibility.

257
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,008
You've been able to observe

258
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,143
the behavior of the prisoner
in the dock...

259
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,112
And in the witness box.

260
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:25,116
My learned friend has
referred to her behavior

261
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,051
as hardened.

262
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,020
Gentlemen and ladies
of the jury,

263
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,155
is there anything so hardy

264
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,226
as the behavior
of sheer innocence?

265
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,162
If you're convinced
that the story

266
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,598
of the defense
represents the facts

267
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,135
it is your duty to
discharge the accused.

268
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,070
I shall like
to remind you

269
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,273
that truth is often
stranger than fiction.

270
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,641
If, on the other hand,

271
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,610
you are convinced
that the evidence

272
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,014
is indeed fiction,
then I must tell you

273
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,016
in the words
of the counsel

274
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,283
of the prosecution

275
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,319
that neither
youth nor beauty

276
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,556
nor provocation
can be held to mitigate

277
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,126
the crime of murder.

278
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:13,431
Go and consider the
facts for yourselves.

279
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,716
Well, uh, ladies
and gentlemen,

280
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,151
we can't talk standing.

281
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,521
Would you ladies like
to sit together?

282
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,189
Anyway...

283
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,477
Why, I say,
may we smoke?

284
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,213
Yes. I don't
see why not.

285
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,450
That is, if the ladies
haven't any objection.

286
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,820
No. Not at all.

287
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,090
Now, I think the best thing to do...
if you agree,

288
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,359
is to allow me to go over
the broad facts of the case.

289
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,495
Because after all,
I think it's pretty clear

290
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,832
and I really don't think
it'll be necessary

291
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,866
for us to examine

292
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,335
all the evidence again
in detail.

293
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,737
Now, in the first place,

294
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,206
the prosecution.

295
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:32,810
They say that the girl
and the dead woman

296
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,480
were on bad terms.

297
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,149
They make it up.

298
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,685
Edna Druce comes to supper,

299
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,121
they both have
a drop too much

300
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,590
and begin quarreling
about some man.

301
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,559
For instance, you heard
how the landlady said

302
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,261
that she heard
raised voices.

303
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,729
And the girl
admits as much

304
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,564
but won't give
the name of the man.

305
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,167
Now that
in itself is fishy.

306
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,470
The girl gets hold
of the poker,

307
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,272
loses her temper,

308
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:04,175
and there's the end
of Edna Druce.

309
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:08,713
The prosecution  argues
that it has proofs.

310
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,316
Practically
caught red-handed.

311
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,919
Girl's dress
all over blood,

312
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,321
the poker at her feet,

313
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,723
brandy flask empty,

314
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,225
and the girl half-silly.

315
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,860
And in addition  to that,

316
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,697
no other person was known
to have entered the house.

317
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,699
I think that's pretty clear.

318
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,602
I think you ought to
mention  that the girl

319
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,237
comes of a good family.

320
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,873
Yes, but it's
those so-called

321
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,208
well-bred people

322
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,210
who are able
to remain so brazen

323
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,546
in the face of
a thing like this.

324
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,780
Well,
look at the way

325
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,315
she behaved
in the box.

326
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,516
Half a minute, ladies.

327
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,285
Let's get on.

328
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,954
Now, take the defense.

329
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,456
They don't deny she did it

330
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,293
but argue
that their case is

331
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,261
that the thing
happened when...

332
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,364
She was in a fit
or something.

333
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,200
Surely it
is clear to you

334
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,435
that in the evidence
for the defense

335
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,704
the doctor put
forWard a theory

336
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,639
that it was due
to the independent

337
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,908
activity of the
suppressed experience.

338
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,278
In other words,
disassociation,

339
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,880
which in this
particular form

340
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,249
is called a fugue.
So that a person

341
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,284
displaying the
strangest behavior

342
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,320
for a considerable
period of time

343
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,521
would be quite
unaware of this

344
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:27,558
when he or she
regained normality.

345
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,827
Well, I think the best thing
for us all to do

346
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,529
is to write down
our opinions

347
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:36,801
and then we can see
how we stand.

348
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,304
Whichever
in the minority...

349
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,976
Can then give
their individual reasons

350
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:49,814
and the thing can be
worked out that way.

351
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,780
That makes 7 guilty...

352
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,517
And 3 not guilty.

353
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,686
There are 2 not in.

354
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,422
I take it you
haven't come

355
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,057
to any decision
at all.

356
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,960
I think the whole
business is hateful.

357
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,561
There's too much
responsibility

358
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,863
put on our shoulders.

359
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,465
Either we've got
to let her go free--

360
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,334
that's not fair
to the rest of the world

361
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:46,003
if she's guilty--
or we got to hang her

362
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,373
But if we
recommend her to mercy.

363
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,642
Mercy? Is that what
you call it?

364
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,377
20 years
cut out of life.

365
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,480
The best years
and to spend them in hell.

366
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,883
Have you ever been
inside a prison?

367
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,551
It takes
a civilized community

368
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,920
to think out
a punishment like that.

369
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,955
I think
you exaggerate.

370
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,390
It's no use
confusing

371
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,326
the issue
like this.

372
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,393
People who do wrong

373
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,696
have got to be
punished somehow.

374
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,098
You can't run the
world on sentiment.

375
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,500
No, but that's what
we've tried to do.

376
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,969
Save the unfit.
Get more children

377
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,739
and make glorious wars
to be rid of.

378
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:25,910
The whole world's
a reeking pit of sentiment.

379
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,748
Your verdict,
mr. Shackleton.

380
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,956
Guilty, I suppose.

381
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,461
Who's the other one?

382
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,435
You, mr. Matthews?

383
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,471
Is there anything
special troubling you

384
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:56,374
so that you can't
make a decision?

385
00:22:56,376 --> 00:23:01,645
What is it prevents you
from making a decision?

386
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:05,583
Well, nothing really.

387
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,751
Uh, well, uh...

388
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,753
Have you made up
your mind at all

389
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,721
what it's going to be?

390
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,091
You heard the case
for the prosecution.

391
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,560
That's pretty clear,
isn't it?

392
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,564
And you know what the
defense is, don't you?

393
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,866
Yes, but I, uh...

394
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,669
Don't quite understand
what the lady meant

395
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:29,173
when she said no.

396
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,143
When, uh...
When she spoke.

397
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,577
My dear man,

398
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,714
mrs. Ward was only
trying to tell you

399
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,882
that the defense was

400
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,750
that murder
was committed

401
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:44,488
in a fit of daytime
sleep walking.

402
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,558
Yes. But, uh...

403
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,996
The murder took
place at nighttime.

404
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,899
Can you write?

405
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,601
Well, will you
please write down

406
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,505
whether you think the
prisoner guilty or not?

407
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,634
Now that leaves
only 3 for not guilty.

408
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,538
I'll give you my reasons
for not guilty.

409
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,608
The evidence for the
defense by the doctor

410
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,844
is to my mind
conclusive.

411
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,046
Anyone who's followed
the modern trend

412
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,547
of pscyhological
investigations

413
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,649
must be aware
that any person

414
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,985
suffering from severe
mental strain,

415
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,854
such as the prisoner
may have been

416
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,523
following on so many
rehearsals and things,

417
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,225
may bring about
a sudden condition

418
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:57,528
in which the patient
is no longer either

419
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,065
conscious of or responsible
for their actions.

420
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,766
We've already
had evidence

421
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,101
that the
prisoner's mind

422
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,536
is a delicately
balanced one

423
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:10,007
and quite liable through
some hidden flaw

424
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,676
in that mind
to become deprived

425
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,512
of all consciousness

426
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,580
and readily enter
into a state

427
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,816
wherein the body
is still functioning,

428
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:22,953
though no longer under
the control of the will.

429
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,922
And it is
on these grounds,

430
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,724
that I feel
that Diana Baring

431
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,260
must have been the
victim of circumstance.

432
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:32,663
I have no doubt that
mrs. Ward is right.

433
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,631
That being the case,

434
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,566
it is quite
liable to recur,

435
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,067
possibly with
the same results.

436
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,604
Well, that's a point
I hadn't considered.

437
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,007
Well, it's really
important.

438
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,542
Because with
this poor gal,

439
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,611
you have to consider not
only this one tragedy

440
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,680
but others
that may follow it.

441
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,715
There may be other crimes lying ...

442
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:56,287
You mean, there's a sort
of dual personality in her.

443
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,989
One of these persons
is violent and cruel

444
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,859
and the other,
just an ordinary woman.

445
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:05,563
If we set this bad
personality free,

446
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,630
we must be prepared

447
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,633
to show her
the responsibility.

448
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:13,771
If we let her go and
anything should happen...

449
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,073
The blood would be
on our hands.

450
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:20,644
Do you wish to alter
your verdict, mrs. Ward?

451
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,658
Now, mr. Daniels...
After all you've heard,

452
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,696
does your opinion  still
remain the same?

453
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,866
Well, you know, I find it
very difficult to believe

454
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,836
that a girl of that sort
should do such a thing.

455
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:51,675
After all, she looks perfectly
riveting, you know.

456
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,645
Well, you know
what I mean?

457
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:57,781
A sort of girl one
would like for a daughter.

458
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,284
I presume, sir,
that an ugly woman

459
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,953
would stand very little
chance at your hand.

460
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,722
The thing you've
got to decide,

461
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:05,789
mr. Daniels,
has nothing to do

462
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,825
with the qualities
of the young lady

463
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,393
as they appeal
to you.

464
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,061
Yes, of course.
I know that.

465
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:14,331
But, that's all, well,
you know what I mean.

466
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,767
It's...It's pretty
awful and all

467
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,002
that sort of thing.

468
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:21,005
Besides the thing
you're thinking of,

469
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:24,208
what's your verdict?

470
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,878
Well...

471
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,848
Well...

472
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,982
Oh...

473
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,885
Guilty, I suppose.

474
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,694
Well, now we're
practically complete.

475
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:47,231
There's just sir John.

476
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,834
Well, don't dismiss me as
easily at that, mr. foreman.

477
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,903
Yes? We mustn't be long.

478
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,338
Time is money, you know?

479
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,375
Time in this case,
may I remind you, is life.

480
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,912
If I'm delaying you all,
I apologize.

481
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,848
I admit that I am not...

482
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,817
A man of business.

483
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,053
I'm a poor actor.

484
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:13,390
Oh, come now,
dear sir John.

485
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,958
I repeat...

486
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,062
The poorest
of poor players.

487
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:21,098
And my time on the stage
will be shortened

488
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,802
had I not for years
trained myself to...

489
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:27,404
How shall I put it...

490
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,874
To apply
the technique of life...

491
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,744
to the problems
of my art.

492
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,779
But today,
ladies and gentlemen,

493
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,181
that process is reversed.

494
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:41,719
I find myself applying
the technique of my art

495
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:45,823
to a problem
of real life.

496
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:51,962
And my art
is not satisfied.

497
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,799
In the first place,

498
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,502
I am fairly convinced that Diana
Baring was telling the thruth

499
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:02,840
when she said
she remembered nothing.

500
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,509
In fact,
I have been impressed

501
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:09,113
by her behavior
all through the trial.

502
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:10,914
But my dear sir!

503
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,449
Oh, I say, sir John.

504
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,084
Oh, please don't
think I'm taking

505
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,821
the same line as our
friend mr. Daniels here.

506
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,456
He made a very
gallant attempt,

507
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:24,194
but I assure you my reasoning
goes a little deeper.

508
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,229
I am convinced further

509
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,531
that she was again
telling the truth

510
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,032
when she said she had
drunk no brandy.

511
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,001
Buy you've forgotten
the evidence

512
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,169
of the police sergeant.

513
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,171
He said she
smelled of drink

514
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,440
and appeared dazed
on arrest.

515
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,143
How do you know that was not
the wine she had at dinner?

516
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,344
What about
the evidence

517
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,012
of Markham,
the stage manager?

518
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,181
He found the empty
brandy flask

519
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,883
right on the spot.
Yes, but--

520
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,886
What about the evidence
of the actor, Stewart?

521
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:49,953
He said the women

522
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,256
had been enemies
for some time.

523
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,491
Ah, he was the one
who said

524
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,794
prisoner was rough to mrs.
Druce on the stage once.

525
00:29:56,796 --> 00:30:01,298
All pointing to her violent
nature, sir John.

526
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,801
Yes, but that
was not altogether

527
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:04,902
borne out by Fane.

528
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,136
You know, the, um...

529
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,305
Well, the female
impersonator man.

530
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,107
But his evidence was
of little use.

531
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,343
He was so obviously in
love with the prisoner.

532
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,914
In any case, everything
was perfectly clear

533
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,016
when the body
was discovered.

534
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,852
Why, the woman
was actually caught

535
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:22,953
in the room
red-handed.

536
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,855
And found with a poker
by her side.

537
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,557
And her dress
all over blood.

538
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,358
And quarrelling
over a man.

539
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,894
That's right.

540
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,897
Any answer to that,
sir John?

541
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,165
Think of her personality.

542
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,035
She's not the kind
of girl to get drunk.

543
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,870
Brandy in the flask,
was there?

544
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,471
She doesn't deny it.

545
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,606
That's right.

546
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,541
Any answer
to that, sir John?

547
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,878
Not at the moment.

548
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,015
Was there anyone entered
the house that night?

549
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,283
Landlady says not.

550
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,318
Girl says not.

551
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,519
They were alone.

552
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:59,389
Any answer
to that, sir John?

553
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,592
Not at the moment.

554
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:04,161
But have we taken it
too much for granted

555
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,930
that no one else
could've done the murder?

556
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:07,865
They were alone.

557
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,199
Says they quarelled.

558
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,167
Admits it.

559
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:14,037
Any answer
to that, sir John?

560
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,907
She does not admit it.

561
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,643
She says she
doesn't remember.

562
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:23,113
Is that
a guilty woman's answer?

563
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:27,050
And her dress
all over blood.

564
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,952
Make an exhibition
of yourself.

565
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:31,054
Waste of time, waste of money.

566
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:31,922
Quarelling.

567
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,490
Hands all over blood.

568
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,158
Any answer?
Any answer?

569
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,495
Any answer
to that, sir John?

570
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,589
Well, now that we've all
agreed on our verdict,

571
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,992
I can inform the judge
that we're ready.

572
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,726
Stand up.

573
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,497
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

574
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,733
have you agreed
upon your verdict?

575
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:28,071
And do you find the prisoner
guilty or not guilty?

576
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,306
Guilty.

577
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:33,310
Diana Baring,
have you anything to say?

578
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,145
My sentence of death

579
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,180
should now
be passed upon you

580
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,482
according to law.

581
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,684
It's absurd,
I tell you.

582
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,520
It's absolutely absurd.

583
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:47,124
oh, yes,
oh, yes, oh, yes

584
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,793
Praise silence,
all of you,

585
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,262
on the pain
of imprisonment

586
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,131
while sentence of death

587
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:57,601
is passed upon the prisoner
at the bar.

588
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,811
Adjourned
until tomorrow.

589
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:43,246
The Baring murder trial

590
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,748
came to
a conclusion  today

591
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,316
with a verdict
of guilty,

592
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:50,754
and sentence of death
was passed on Diana Baring.

593
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,190
And that
is all the news.

594
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,092
But here is an S.O.S.,

595
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,194
which has just been
brought into the studio.

596
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,529
We've been asked by the
commissioner of police

597
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,331
to broadcast
the following--

598
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:05,135
The brandy cocktail
you ordered, sir.

599
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,670
Right.

600
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,606
Ring up mr. Bennett,
will you?

601
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:13,243
And ask him to bring me the
details of the receipts

602
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,277
for the last 3 nights.

603
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,280
Also,...booking...

604
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:22,886
With New Scotland Yard to
telephone Victoria 7000

605
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:26,690
or with
any police station.

606
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,494
This is
the national program.

607
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:33,563
Our concert tonight
is an orchestral one,

608
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:37,467
given by the radio
symphony orchestra.

609
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,270
They start by playing
the overture

610
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:44,875
to <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>
<i>by Wagner.</i>

611
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,812
Funny that S.O.S.

612
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,248
Coming on top of that other.

613
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,617
Save her soul.

614
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,553
Save her.

615
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,488
If I'd stood up longer,

616
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,291
I might have worn them down.

617
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:04,528
Why couldn't they see
the girl as I did...

618
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,398
The rest of the fellows
on the jury.

619
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,234
But anyone standing
in the dark

620
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,836
on a charge like that...

621
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,705
Probably looks different
from the same person

622
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,174
somewhere else.

623
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,944
Ah, amusing the way
she stood up to everybody.

624
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:25,615
There's no doubt
that did her a lot of harm.

625
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:29,886
Yet, it was that
manner of hers that...

626
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,923
Very attractive I thought.

627
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,260
And I wonder what
her feelings are now.

628
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,473
Who drank that brandy?!

629
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:54,578
Why didn't I force
that point home to them?

630
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,448
Easy to figure these
things out afterwards.

631
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,485
The girl said
she didn't drink it.

632
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:07,257
Yet she admits she might
have killed Edna Druce.

633
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,758
That's queer.

634
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,327
Why admit a big
thing like that

635
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,762
and yet be sure she
didn't do a small thing

636
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,466
such as drink
a drop of brandy?

637
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,303
All that came
to light to me today.

638
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,273
I'm sure I was right
when I raised that.

639
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,774
Quite frankly,
more certain now.

640
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,311
How do we know that someone else
didn't drink the brandy?

641
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,280
Perhaps there
was someone else,

642
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:31,448
that's the whole thing.

643
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,949
Whoever drank that brandy!

644
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:37,821
Mr. Bennett has come up
to see you, sir John.

645
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,307
Bennett.

646
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,409
Glad you're back,
sir John.

647
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,578
Been reading
about it all.

648
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,446
Plenty of publicity.

649
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,414
Been awful
for you, though.

650
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,583
You having
met days before.

651
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,419
Well, she wanted
to become a star,

652
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,920
a year ago that was.

653
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:14,424
I suppose you can say
in a sense that she has.

654
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,359
A star in a murder--

655
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,361
Bennett, please.

656
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,664
Look here.

657
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,699
Get hold of my understudy.

658
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,567
Tell him he has
to go on again tonight.

659
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,538
Pray god that I give him
a better role.

660
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,408
Get on the telephone
straight away

661
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,344
to my lawyer,
mr. Vice senior.

662
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,913
Oh, I can give it to you.

663
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,315
Temple bar.

664
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,717
5-9-9-3.

665
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,420
Yes.

666
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,866
I want you, as well,

667
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,903
to get hold of
as many as you can

668
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,438
of the members
of that company.

669
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,639
You know,
the touring company

670
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,074
at the time
of the murder.

671
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,343
In particular,
the, um...

672
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:09,379
funny little man,
the stage manager.

673
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,814
I forget his name.

674
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:15,485
I'll see him at the
office in the morning.

675
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,854
Temple bar,
5, double 9, 3.

676
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,823
But I thought
the trial

677
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,458
was over, sir John.

678
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,493
No, my dear, Bennett,

679
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,928
the trial is not over,

680
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,429
by a hell of a long way.

681
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,798
Well...Is it conscience,
sir John?

682
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,402
Conscience.
A lying man's conscience.

683
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,938
Oh, they're--
they're engaged, sir.

684
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,608
Ok. I'll try later.
Don't wait.

685
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,615
I am.

686
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,119
No, don't wait. Go.

687
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,635
Diana Baring...

688
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,438
Why did I send her away?

689
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,540
Told her it'd
be good for her

690
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,976
to gain experience
...

691
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,978
Good for her.

692
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,149
And now she's come back.

693
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,590
Uh...

694
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,624
I think, uh...

695
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:36,192
Boiling it
all down, dear,

696
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,260
I think perhaps
we better, uh...

697
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,729
Accept sir John's
offer after all,

698
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,598
don't you?

699
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,535
Oh, yes.
Either that one

700
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:49,105
or one of the other 2.
It's all the same to me.

701
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,510
That would be
sir John himself.

702
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,578
I don't think.

703
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:01,651
Seems she won't let us
stay on here any longer.

704
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,520
That means Lucy
will have to go back

705
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,588
to her aunt's--
oh, I mean, uh--

706
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,992
Sophie will have to go
back to her aunt Lucy.

707
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:11,094
I don't want to go
back to aunt Lucy.

708
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,996
I want to go on tour
with you.

709
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,665
I can't let you go
back to sir John's.

710
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:19,636
I really thought you were
kidding me, I really did.

711
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,638
What is this?

712
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,708
Ooh. It's from
sir John himself.

713
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,646
If we could be in
his office at 12:00.

714
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31,114
Do you think
we could get there

715
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,181
in time today?

716
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:33,116
If we try.

717
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:35,618
I'll turn
the kettle off.

718
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,756
This just needs
a little benzine.

719
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,659
Dear, I don't think...

720
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,095
Petrol will get
the shine out of this suit.

721
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,598
I'll say! There's
a job for you!

722
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,632
Look sharper.

723
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,601
I think it must be
an ankie.

724
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,835
Yeah. I think so somewhere.

725
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,003
ted?
Yes, dear?

726
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,672
What have you done
with me nail polish?

727
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,273
I haven't seen it.

728
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,741
Here.

729
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,145
Hope this...Hope this smell
of petrol goes off.

730
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:04,747
Oh, well, you can blame
it onto the car.

731
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,884
I think we shall
just about do it.

732
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,919
Actually, my dear,
it won't be.

733
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,621
Oh, that's
all right, missus.

734
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:12,755
I promise
you your bill

735
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,790
shall be paid
the first.

736
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,058
I'm not referring
to bills.

737
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,759
It's Druce I'm after.

738
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:17,627
Two seats...

739
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:19,996
All right. We'll see.

740
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,208
How do you do,
mr. Markham?

741
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,711
Nice.
Thanks, sir John.

742
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,718
Ohh. How do you do,
sir John?

743
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,086
Won't you sit down?

744
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:45,188
Thank you.

745
00:43:55,399 --> 00:44:00,169
You know, it seems
to me, mr. Markham,

746
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:04,907
that we as artists
have a double function.

747
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,043
We use life
to create art

748
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:11,314
and we use art to,
how shall I put it...

749
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,916
to criticize life.

750
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,352
Oh, certain,
mr. John.

751
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,920
Uhh!

752
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:21,157
Yes. I knew you would.

753
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,326
Now, mr. Markham,

754
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,028
between artists...

755
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,131
Do we always fulfill
our double function?

756
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,099
Are we not
so much occupied

757
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,001
in using life
to create art

758
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,904
that we forget
our other function?

759
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,074
I foresee
your objection.

760
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,175
You're going to say,

761
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,310
what opportunities does
the round

762
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:42,745
of daily life offer?

763
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,747
I wonder if...

764
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:45,815
If you ever saw

765
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,685
a problem play
I once did.

766
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,420
<i>Pistols for two.</i>

767
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:51,287
Oh, yes.

768
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:55,391
What the critics describe
as a high-brow shocker.

769
00:44:55,393 --> 00:45:00,697
When a high-brow shocker
occurs in real life,

770
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,333
does the public
call in the actor?

771
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,735
No.

772
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:06,736
Uh...

773
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,772
mr. Markham,
I read your thoughts.

774
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,878
You know, you're
saying to yourself,

775
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,881
this man is, um,
talking to his hat.

776
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:19,849
Oh, no.

777
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,317
Oh, of course you are.

778
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,087
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be the practical man

779
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:25,488
I take you for.

780
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,156
You're also wondering
to yourself,

781
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,059
why on earth
I've brought you here.

782
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,260
Well...

783
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:34,964
That brings me at last...

784
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,933
To my object.

785
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:37,967
Now...

786
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,169
Yesterday and
the day before,

787
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:44,006
I was on the jury
at the Baring trial.

788
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:48,144
You impressed me both as
an artist and as a man.

789
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:51,848
By the way you gave
your evidence.

790
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,883
Now, I want from you,

791
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,952
if I'm not being
too indiscrete--

792
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:59,989
the inner history
of that case.

793
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,828
Oh, what is
it that, uh...

794
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,930
See, now, of course, um...

795
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,298
Bennett talked over with you

796
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,802
the question
of that engagement?

797
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:14,937
You see, we'd rather, uh...

798
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,240
Rather hoped that you'd
be free to take on

799
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,142
the stage management
when I send off

800
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:22,812
this tour at christmas
of <i>The Green Eye.</i>

801
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:25,948
I also thought of working out some
arrangement on a yearly bases

802
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,118
but we could easily
talk that over later

803
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,456
Oh. Thank you very
much indeed, sir John.

804
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,891
I, uh...

805
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,260
Well, I am free
at the moment.

806
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:39,495
And I've had
a lot of experience

807
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,898
that I'm sure
will come in very handy.

808
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,800
Then that's
settled, huh?

809
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,902
Uh, yes.

810
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,837
What? What is it,
mr. Markham?

811
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,406
Well, it's my wife,
sir John.

812
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,843
You see, we've always
been joint,

813
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:55,978
as you may say and, uh...

814
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,581
Well, would it be
asking too much, sir John,

815
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,918
if a part, I mean,
any part that you--

816
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,887
ohh. I see.
mrs. Markham acts.

817
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:06,189
Acts, sir John?

818
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:07,523
Heh. Well, uh...

819
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:10,860
Perhaps it's not for me
to say, but...

820
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:14,397
Well, you may say I'm
prejudiced, sir John,

821
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,966
but I've been stage manager
now for 10 years,

822
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:19,202
and it is a fact that
a wife, even a good one,

823
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,504
is not always the right thing
to have in a company,

824
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,906
if you understand
what I'm getting at,

825
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:28,010
My Doucie, my wife--well, professionally,
she's been my right hand.

826
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,948
And there's no one she can't
play 24 hours' notice.

827
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:36,118
From a Gladys Cooper
to a Molly Lloyd part.

828
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,021
Has she ever--
she has her--

829
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:43,392
I was going to say she has
her off days, of course.

830
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:44,961
Well, who hasn't?

831
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,229
Yes. I mean,
only last summer

832
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,931
I had to speak to her
seriously about it.

833
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:52,235
She had a quick
change-over from a barmaid

834
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:53,970
to a Salvation Army lass.

835
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:57,073
And it told on her,
there's no doubt about it,

836
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:00,443
after about a week,
I said to her straight out:

837
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:01,978
"Now look here, my dear,
this can't go on

838
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,047
if you can't
pull yourself together,

839
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,517
we shall have
to go into Shakespeare."

840
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,887
Well, she didn't say much.

841
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,989
Not one that was reasonable.

842
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,657
But she thought it over.

843
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,359
And for the rest
of that tour

844
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,928
I'll give you
my word, sir John,

845
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,296
she was tallulah.

846
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:22,265
Pure tallulah.

847
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,066
Where is mrs. Markham now?

848
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,068
She's downstairs
waiting in the--

849
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,236
Oh. One minute then.

850
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:31,007
Let's send
for her to come up.

851
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,544
What, is that you, Bennett?

852
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,314
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. No.

853
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,950
Wait.

854
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:44,921
Hello, Bennett, mrs. Markham
is somewhere downstairs.

855
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:48,257
Would you have her
sent up, please?

856
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,994
Yes. Yes, of course.
Up to my room.

857
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,233
Now, mr. Markham...

858
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:58,467
About this trial...

859
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:03,072
I confess to feeling
very uneasy about it.

860
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,207
You see, I played
a part in the thing,

861
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,943
the part of a juryman.

862
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,946
And it was not until
the curtain was rung down

863
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:12,448
on the death sentence,
that I said to myself...

864
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:18,220
This is not a play,
this is life.

865
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:19,989
Life can be less kind

866
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,624
than your dramatists,
mr. Markham.

867
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:25,027
Life permits a beautiful
and unfortunate girl

868
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,997
to go to the gallows.
Unless--

869
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:32,601
art for once can bring
its technique to bear.

870
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,570
Good lord, do you
mean to say she is

871
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:38,040
innocent,
my dear Markham, yes.

872
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,148
It was assumed
she was guilty

873
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,984
because she couldn't
deny it.

874
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,318
Yes, but I saw the--

875
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,254
Diana Baring sitting
beside the dead body.

876
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:53,456
She was dazed you say.

877
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,658
What was
the cause? Drink?

878
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,094
She hardly ever
touched anything.

879
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,629
And who did? Think
it over, mr. Markham.

880
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,765
Then there was the pain
in her head.

881
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,567
Was she examined
by a doctor?

882
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:08,204
Might he not have found
traces of a blow

883
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:10,106
if he'd examined her?

884
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,107
But no, he didn't.

885
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:12,641
He assumed
like everyone else

886
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,542
that she was guilty

887
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,144
because she
didn't deny it.

888
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:18,114
And there was no
private investigation,

889
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,583
no inquiry,

890
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,252
think it over,
mr. Markham.

891
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:31,193
I feel the most
terrible responsibility.

892
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,628
I was one
of the 12 people

893
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,431
who decided the fate
of this poor girl.

894
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,767
I found myself
caught up

895
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:39,402
with the machine that--

896
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:42,271
that makes
these things...

897
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,109
Ah, mrs. Markham,
so good of you to come

898
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,377
with your husband
this morning.

899
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,779
Oh, I was
quite glad,

900
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:52,715
glad as a breath
of fresh air.

901
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,352
Oh. What a charming
place you have up here,

902
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,120
sir John.

903
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:59,188
And Piccadilly,

904
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,124
with all
the shops so near.

905
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,533
You'll, um...

906
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,635
You'll stay
to lunch, of course.

907
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:16,238
I find it difficult
sometimes to wait

908
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,607
to a reasonable hour
for my luncheon.

909
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,243
I feel
the same way myself.

910
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,179
That I can do
without my little

911
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,114
tidbits
in the morning...

912
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,450
Oh, Javier, a cocktail
at once, please,

913
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:28,784
and serve lunch.

914
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:31,487
He's engaged us
to see him.

915
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,721
Joint.
No.

916
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:36,659
Yes. I find mr. Markham
is free to join me.

917
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,694
So...Please.

918
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:40,596
So I thought
he could, um...

919
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,798
Oh, we can settle
all that later,

920
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,167
can't we? Yes, please.

921
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,504
Thank you.

922
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,173
Oh, thank you.

923
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,678
Oh, one moment, please.

924
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:13,262
In the meantime, success
to our researches.

925
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,665
Your husband and I have
been discussing

926
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:17,700
the Baring case.

927
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:19,268
And we feel that
if the murder

928
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,871
were approached
from another angle,

929
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:26,342
it--oh, sorry.
We shall be able

930
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:29,211
to arrive
at a different result.

931
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:32,481
What? And get Diana
off you mean?

932
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:37,586
But she can't
get away from that poker.

933
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,201
If you don't share
our convictions

934
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:56,205
that miss Baring
is not guilty--

935
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,576
well, I mean to say
Diana Baring

936
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,278
was such
a nice girl.

937
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,579
I never thought
for one moment

938
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:06,248
she could've done
a thing like that.

939
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,217
Didn't
I always say, Ted,

940
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:11,253
never could've thought
it for one moment?

941
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,190
Oh, sir John, have you
found anything out?

942
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:16,258
Are you going to take it
up yourself?

943
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,194
Oh, we would be so glad

944
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,596
to help,
wouldn't we, Ted?

945
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,301
Shall we now?

946
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,307
I really don't know
where to begin

947
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,310
this thing,
do you, Markham?

948
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,413
Well, uh...
Well, yes, sir John.

949
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,415
Oh, I see. Uh...

950
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:43,285
Yes. I wish I knew
where to begin.

951
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,287
Here.

952
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,000
Yes, can I help
you there?

953
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:01,971
Sir John didn't know
where to begin, Ted.

954
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:05,407
No, no. Let's
hear it, mrs. Markham.

955
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,409
See, I'm completely
in the dark.

956
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,645
If your husband
could show the way,

957
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,648
I shall be more
than grateful.

958
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:16,285
Go on.
What is it, Markham?

959
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:17,386
Well, sir John...

960
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,321
I should say
the best place

961
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,357
would be the back
of the town

962
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,826
where the murder
was committed.

963
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,897
Yes. Do you think
you could spare me

964
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,599
a day or two
of your time?

965
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,369
Why, yes, of course
we could, sir.

966
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:34,637
See, if I might suggest

967
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,372
that we could
go over the ground

968
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:38,274
and you could show me
one or two places

969
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:39,275
connected
with the murder.

970
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,777
But, you mean, it
might have been

971
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:42,945
someone else
altogether,

972
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,346
who killed
Edna Druce?

973
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:47,416
It might've been
somebody from outside.

974
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,518
How do you make
that out?

975
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,353
Well, I don't know.

976
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,322
Miss Mitcham
didn't do it.

977
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:55,291
And miss Diana didn't.

978
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,559
So it must've been
somebody from outside.

979
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,728
If it was,
they'd have to get in.

980
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,031
And they'd have
to get out again.

981
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:03,432
Heh. That's clever.

982
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:06,402
Well, all
I can say is...

983
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:08,370
The first thing
we got to do

984
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:10,906
is to find out
who saw somebody,

985
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,375
apart from Druce,
anywhere near there

986
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:14,977
at half-past one
that morning.

987
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,579
Well, Ted, for start,
there's that chap

988
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,481
we thought was
the policeman

989
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,916
coming around
the corner.

990
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,551
Oh, that was nothing.

991
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:25,421
I shall like
to hear something

992
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,822
about this policeman.

993
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:29,491
Well, you see,
sir John,

994
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,527
it was like this...

995
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,562
Only after
the murder,

996
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,664
when the knocking
woke us up,

997
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,666
I was over
by the window

998
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,569
and I popped my head
out of the window

999
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,905
to see who it was making
all that noise.

1000
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,506
And I saw the policeman

1001
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,674
coming around
the corner.

1002
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,009
So I said to Ted,

1003
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,044
I said,
hey, it's the police.

1004
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,980
And then I took
my eyes off him

1005
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,749
to tell Ted here...

1006
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,518
And when I looked again,

1007
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,687
there was
no one in sight.

1008
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,955
And then Ted said,

1009
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,857
yes, you're right.
Here he comes.

1010
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,759
And when
I looked again,

1011
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,596
it was a different
policeman altogether.

1012
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,833
What had become
of the first one?

1013
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:14,937
He must have turned
the corner and come back.

1014
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:18,107
Is that the corner
down there?

1015
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:19,975
Yes, that's it, sir.

1016
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,578
You're sure it
wasn't the same man?

1017
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:27,549
We only took our eyes off
of him about 2 seconds.

1018
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:31,854
Uh...Is there anymore
here do you think, sir?

1019
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,456
I shouldn't
think so.

1020
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,738
My god, that's Druce.

1021
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,607
He must be crazy.

1022
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:54,643
Yeah, we better get down.

1023
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,647
You are not going in my house.

1024
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,457
Take him away, please.

1025
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:10,592
He's done this before.

1026
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,428
Please, promise to stop it.

1027
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,629
Yes, that's
all right.

1028
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:14,797
Now come along,
Druce.

1029
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:15,864
My wife's...

1030
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,434
But you're much
better at home.

1031
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:22,571
Come on.
Come on now.

1032
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,515
Oh, this is terrible

1033
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:34,783
for me this business is.

1034
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,520
I shall have to move.
I'm sure I shall.

1035
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:39,855
Yes. Well, uh...

1036
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:41,156
mrs. Mitcham,

1037
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,491
we'd like
to show

1038
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:43,525
this gentleman
around.

1039
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:45,828
That is, if you
don't mind.

1040
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,129
May I?

1041
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,798
Oh. Yes, sir.
Of course.

1042
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,035
Yes. Certainly.
Will you come in?

1043
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,617
Well, sir John,

1044
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,486
that's where
they found the body.

1045
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,489
Right in front
of the hearth there.

1046
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,691
And, uh...

1047
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,793
Miss Baring was sitting
just about there.

1048
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:21,763
Oh, by the way, did you ever
get your poker back, miss--

1049
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,866
oh, I can't bear
to talk about it,

1050
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:25,968
especially with
poor miss Baring

1051
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,069
being where she is.

1052
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:32,574
Why, you might as well
convict Cleopatra.

1053
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,648
You think anybody
could've got in

1054
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,251
from the back
of the house?

1055
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,757
You see just beyond
the backyard

1056
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,592
there's an alleyway,

1057
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:51,927
and just
beyond there

1058
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,061
there's the theatre.

1059
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,564
And look, sir,
the dressing rooms

1060
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,266
are at the back.

1061
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,669
Yes, it would
take quite an athlete

1062
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:01,837
to get in that way.

1063
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,871
I don't see how

1064
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,840
anyone could
get in here

1065
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:05,807
with this aspidistra

1066
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,009
filling up
the window.

1067
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,610
Anyway, without
upsetting it,

1068
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,212
and look
at the size of it.

1069
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:13,048
Yes. It's a fine plant.

1070
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,584
Unless, of course, it was
somebody who knew the room.

1071
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:18,987
But miss Baring did not
have any visitors,

1072
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,722
only mrs. Markham
every now and again,

1073
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,592
and mr. Fane and
mr. Stewart to tea

1074
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:24,993
and mister--
what's his name--

1075
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:27,796
the little man with
the squeaky voice.

1076
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:28,931
Oh, Tom Druid.

1077
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,300
Yes. Yes, that's him.

1078
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:43,111
Squeaky voice,
that reminds me.

1079
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,013
In your evidence,
miss Mitcham,

1080
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:48,784
you said you had heard
angry women's voices.

1081
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:50,285
Yes, sir, I did. Will
you swear to that?

1082
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:55,791
Oh, yes, sir. You can't
mistake a woman's voice.

1083
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,168
You know, I had
known a contralto--

1084
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,870
oh, yes, but this
was high, quite high.

1085
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,006
Miss Mitcham.
Miss Mitcham.

1086
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:13,742
Oh, my god, miss Mitcham.
Where are you?

1087
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:16,645
The kitchen chimney's
on fire, miss Mitcham!

1088
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:17,813
That's alice.

1089
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:18,981
One moment, miss Mitcham.

1090
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:21,917
Excuse me, sir.
I can't stop just now.

1091
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,218
That Alice
of mine has set

1092
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,653
the kitchen chimney
on fire.

1093
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,121
Didn't you hear
her calling?

1094
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,056
No, no, no.
That was me.

1095
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,157
Or did I...

1096
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,194
You know, Markham,
I never know.

1097
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:36,698
I played a trick
on you, miss Mitcham.

1098
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,034
Now, the high voice
you heard that night

1099
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:45,707
may not have been a woman's.
You've just admitted it.

1100
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,976
No. I have not
admitted anything.

1101
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,179
And I don't hold to
playing such tricks.

1102
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,281
And I'd like
to ask you, sir,

1103
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:54,750
what you mean by it.

1104
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,286
And you, too,
mr. Markham.

1105
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:00,856
Standing there,
grinning.

1106
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:03,925
You realize that
your evidence as it stands

1107
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:06,395
may hang miss Baring?

1108
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:08,764
Now, I'm not blaming you.

1109
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:10,098
Not blaming you,
miss Mitcham.

1110
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,334
But you swore
that you heard

1111
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,802
women's voices calling.

1112
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:15,737
And I have
to prove to them

1113
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,172
that it might have
been a man's voice,

1114
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,875
especially a high-pitched
man's voice--

1115
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,376
just like mr. Druid's.

1116
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:24,680
Ohh! I'd do anything
for miss Baring.

1117
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,248
Oh, can't something
be done now?

1118
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,051
Yes, yes. Now you're
going to help us further.

1119
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:31,787
First of all,
could you show us

1120
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:32,954
some more of the house?

1121
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,990
Miss Baring's bedroom,
for example?

1122
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,725
Yes. Certainly, sir.

1123
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:38,760
This way, please.

1124
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:43,065
I don't think you'll
find much in here, sir.

1125
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:44,800
There's a few
of her things

1126
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:46,435
over there
on the windowsill.

1127
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:48,870
I didn't like
to send them

1128
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,072
to where she is now.

1129
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:52,240
Oh, I think
she'd like them.

1130
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,709
Well, let me
have them

1131
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,777
and I'll send
them on.

1132
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,822
Why, it's
one of you, sir.

1133
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:22,304
Uh...Lot more places
to go to, sir John.

1134
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,851
Thank you.

1135
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:38,220
Thank you
very much indeed.

1136
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:38,987
Thank you.

1137
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,188
Thank you
very much.

1138
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,924
Yes. Lot more
places, sir John.

1139
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,927
And then we'll go round
to Stewart's lodgings

1140
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,129
and then
we might go along

1141
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,130
to the police
station,

1142
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,364
have a chat
with the inspector.

1143
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:50,999
He knows me.
And then, um...

1144
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,335
Well, then we can go
across the Red Lion,

1145
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,137
have a sandwich
while we're talking

1146
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:57,172
to Joe
the proprietor.

1147
01:02:57,174 --> 01:02:58,373
And then--ooh,

1148
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,474
and then
there's Stevens,

1149
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,443
if the policeman's
still on his beat.

1150
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:04,880
Yes, I think that's
about all we can do.

1151
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06,815
Oh, yes, we'll find
out something

1152
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:08,183
if it takes us
all night.

1153
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:10,118
I thought perhaps, um...

1154
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,353
A little dinner...

1155
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:13,889
Oh. Oh, that's all
right, sir John.

1156
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:16,091
Don't you worry
about Doucie and me.

1157
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:17,559
We've had to go
without before,

1158
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:18,827
didn't we, dear?

1159
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:23,031
Well, shall we begin,
sir John? This way.

1160
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,249
I've come to see
if any of my people

1161
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,984
left anything behind.

1162
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:43,919
No, nothing,

1163
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:44,953
except that there
broken basin

1164
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,555
in number 4
dressing room.

1165
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:48,890
Of your chaps
after they left.

1166
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,959
They never paid
for it neither.

1167
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:54,229
Uh, Fane's and Stewart's,
I believe, sir.

1168
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:57,065
No, none of our people
broke that, mate.

1169
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,834
Oh, there is
something for you.

1170
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:01,870
This cigarette case left
behind in number 4.

1171
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:03,104
You'll know
who it belong to.

1172
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,006
Oh, righto. When
I find out who it is,

1173
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,241
I'll forward it.

1174
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,043
Can we see
that dressing room?

1175
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:11,580
Uh, I'd like to see
that broken basin.

1176
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:14,249
I'll take you long.

1177
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,076
Where does that window
look out to?

1178
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:43,511
The private houses
round the corner.

1179
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:47,616
I wish I knew
who broke that basin.

1180
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,291
Lot more places to
go to, sir John.

1181
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,211
Thank you, mate.

1182
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,146
Good day.

1183
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,414
Did you find anything?

1184
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,016
No, nothing much.

1185
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,084
Oh, honestly.

1186
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,134
Well, here we are,
sir John.

1187
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:42,137
And, uh, I hope
you sleep well.

1188
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:45,407
She's left something
cold out for you.

1189
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:49,344
I'll be along
first thing in the morning.

1190
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:55,350
I'm awfully sorry but...
Get to bed myself.

1191
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:59,120
I must say, this street
gives me the creeps.

1192
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,956
Well, good night, sir John.

1193
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,457
Come along, dear.

1194
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,701
I say, Markham.

1195
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,074
Markham...

1196
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:21,409
You don't think
that I'd better

1197
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:26,281
eat at the Red Lion
after all, do you?

1198
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,116
Well, that's, uh...

1199
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,452
Just as you like,
of course, sir John,

1200
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,386
but, uh...

1201
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:33,288
I thought you
wanted to sleep

1202
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:38,994
I mean, that's why
I made the arrangements.

1203
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,196
Considering
we haven't found out

1204
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,465
very much today,
I think that...

1205
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:46,301
It'd be better
if you did, sir.

1206
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,169
Perhaps
you're right.

1207
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,171
Good night,
mrs. Markham.

1208
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,073
Oh, good night,
sir John.

1209
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:54,075
Excuse me, sir.

1210
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,753
Be quiet.
You, too, children.

1211
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,288
Take it.

1212
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,090
Ohh.

1213
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,559
We mustn't play
on the bed.

1214
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,828
Sir, shall I pull
over the table?

1215
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,230
Leave them things be!

1216
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,532
Oh, please,
don't trouble.

1217
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:53,068
Just put the plate
on somewhere.

1218
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,071
I'll see to it.
I'll dress first.

1219
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:57,672
Oh, don't say that, sir.

1220
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:59,340
I know what
you gents like.

1221
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:03,144
"A nice cup of tea and
a kipper before I get up.

1222
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,412
And I'm a new man."

1223
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,549
That's what my last
lodger used to say.

1224
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:13,188
Stop playing
on that bed!

1225
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,355
Damn children.

1226
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,224
They follow me about.

1227
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,826
Ma this and ma that.

1228
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:21,729
On my word, I don't
have a moment's peace

1229
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:23,198
morning or night.

1230
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,633
What do you
two be doing?

1231
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:27,202
That's quite
all right, really.

1232
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:28,236
He's got my bootsy!

1233
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:29,270
Well, I never did.

1234
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,674
Wait till i
get you downstairs.

1235
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:39,747
And don't you
bring it up here again.

1236
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:43,151
If you could put
this plate on the table

1237
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:45,286
and bring up some
hot water at once,

1238
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,422
just as you
like, sir, but...

1239
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,193
Now, go downstairs and
get the water on. Go on.

1240
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:54,896
Now, why can't
you leave him be?

1241
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:58,133
I've told them not to mess
with the lodger's luggage.

1242
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,735
I'll have your father take
you to the police station

1243
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,504
if you can't stop touching.

1244
01:09:02,506 --> 01:09:04,539
They do keep on touching.

1245
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,207
Some lodgers
don't like it.

1246
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,877
Princeton, I had a couple
a little while back

1247
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:12,447
and one of them give them
a good clip for doing that.

1248
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:13,681
You know
the Baring case?

1249
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,150
Well,
they was in it.

1250
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:18,686
It was my husband
what found the body.

1251
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:22,223
He was part
of the Baring case.

1252
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:25,560
Ohh.
Well, I never.

1253
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:28,663
Ha ha! She's taken
a fancy to you.

1254
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,232
There ain't many
she takes to.

1255
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,334
You're not
coming around now,

1256
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,269
I suppose.

1257
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:35,503
Yes, oh, yes.

1258
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,238
You were saying...

1259
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,374
About hopping
on the luggage...

1260
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:40,508
Oh, yes. Well,

1261
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,409
Arthur
was messing about

1262
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,178
with one
of them's luggage

1263
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,212
when he come across
what he thought

1264
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,548
was his father's
helmet and uniform.

1265
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,216
Afterwards,
I went up.

1266
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:50,485
And I said I don't
like the idea

1267
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:51,753
of having this
in my home.

1268
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:54,722
Just because he had
a uniform in the bag

1269
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,791
it was his father's
outfit.

1270
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:59,260
I felt a bit of a fool
when I finished

1271
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:00,762
because he simply
turned around

1272
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,363
and he said
I didn't know

1273
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,531
what I was
talking about.

1274
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,233
Well, I said
if it wasn't you,

1275
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:06,834
it must have been
the other one

1276
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,403
who was here--
mr. Stewart.

1277
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:09,671
I spoke to mr. Stewart
afterWards

1278
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,472
but in the excitement
of the murder

1279
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,807
I forgot all about it.

1280
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:19,280
Come in, my dear Markham.

1281
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,584
I thought
I'd drop by, miss.

1282
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:24,986
I'll send
the water up, sir.

1283
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:28,590
Don't encourage her too
much, sir. That's right.

1284
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:31,292
Here, Arthur.
Just come on, come on.

1285
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:33,561
Now go
in the street and play.

1286
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,430
Don't you get
run over. Go on.

1287
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,799
That's right, go on.

1288
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,637
Doucie and me found out
something, sir John.

1289
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:44,239
Won't you sit down?

1290
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:45,907
Thanks.

1291
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,976
You know that cigarette case
you found in the theatre?

1292
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,811
Well, last night I went
to smoke in bed

1293
01:10:49,813 --> 01:10:51,479
just before I went off,
you see?

1294
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:52,847
So I took out that case.

1295
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:54,315
Doucie saw it wasn't mine.

1296
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,251
Said, I've seen it
before somewhere.

1297
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,353
I said, whose is it?
She said Stewart's.

1298
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:02,523
She noticed what I thought
was a beer stain on it...

1299
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:04,892
She says, wait a minute.
That's blood on it.

1300
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,295
And sure enough. Well,
look, see for yourself,

1301
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,330
sir John. Look.

1302
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:13,368
I believe you're right.

1303
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,505
Stewart.

1304
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,408
Who wore
a policeman's uniform

1305
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,043
in the past
who lived here?

1306
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:23,811
Fane and Stewart, sir.

1307
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,413
Stewart had
a quick change-over

1308
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:29,284
but Fane had a special
uniform made to fit him

1309
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:31,986
so we had 2 uniforms
in the company, sir John.

1310
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:35,423
You're an important factor
in this case, Markham.

1311
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:38,059
In fact, most important
at the moment.

1312
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:39,794
Well, uh...

1313
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,430
Well, if it helps, sir John.

1314
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,965
No, the most
important factor

1315
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,467
seems to be
a policeman

1316
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,769
whom you did not see

1317
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,070
on the night
of the murder.

1318
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:51,372
You remember your
wife saw a policeman

1319
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:54,442
you went to the window
and you couldn't see one.

1320
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:56,344
Then suddenly there
was a policeman.

1321
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:57,745
Now, Markham...

1322
01:11:57,747 --> 01:12:01,582
That policeman was
2 different people.

1323
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:03,384
And for all we know...

1324
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:05,353
The first one
was not a member

1325
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:06,554
of the county
constabulary.

1326
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,823
You mean, the first one
was a fake, sir?

1327
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,458
A chap in
policeman's clothes?

1328
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,594
Our next job is to find
out the name of the man

1329
01:12:13,596 --> 01:12:16,597
was he a member
of the company?

1330
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:19,067
Did he wear
a policeman's uniform?

1331
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:22,737
If she still refuses
to give the name...

1332
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,942
Perhaps the cigarette case
will help her to remember.

1333
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:32,580
They were calling about
on the night of the murder?

1334
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,659
This end, please.

1335
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,835
Won't you sit down?

1336
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:02,069
Oh.

1337
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,539
Thank you.

1338
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:27,028
It's very good
of you to have come.

1339
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,198
But I can't help saying...

1340
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,203
I'm extremely surprised.

1341
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,672
Well, you see, I...

1342
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:41,576
I've taken a very great
interest in your case.

1343
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:44,545
Don't let's talk about it.

1344
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:49,517
How's your play going?

1345
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:52,487
Oh...Pretty fair.

1346
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:55,556
Of course you know I was
away from it some time

1347
01:14:55,558 --> 01:15:00,228
because I was on
the jury of your trial.

1348
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,565
I know.

1349
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:10,571
My countryhouse is
in that district.

1350
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,774
As you know, I can't
discuss with you

1351
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:16,277
what happened
on the jury...

1352
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:21,048
Is Muriel Heatherly still
playing the lead with you?

1353
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,585
I do think
she's such a good actress.

1354
01:15:24,587 --> 01:15:26,187
Don't you?

1355
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,189
Miss Baring...

1356
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,525
You remember
our meeting?

1357
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:31,893
Oh, yes.

1358
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:33,828
You do remember.

1359
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,663
Of course.

1360
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,765
Very well.

1361
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:42,236
If I hadn't sent
you away on tour

1362
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:43,571
to get experience...

1363
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:47,108
You wouldn't be
in this position  now.

1364
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,110
That's, in a way,

1365
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:50,678
why I feel...

1366
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,913
Sort of...

1367
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:53,681
Responsibility.

1368
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,550
That's why I've come.

1369
01:15:55,552 --> 01:16:00,555
There must be some
grounds for an appeal.

1370
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,993
I knew that would happen.

1371
01:16:05,995 --> 01:16:08,963
I knew someone would try
and get me off

1372
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:11,299
and think they were
doing me a kindness.

1373
01:16:11,301 --> 01:16:13,801
Imprisonment for life.

1374
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:18,639
Why, a week of it's
nearly driven me crazy.

1375
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:24,045
If they want to do
the other thing...

1376
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:26,714
They can.

1377
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:30,318
I thought it
and got over it.

1378
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:36,691
It'll be no worse
than the dentist.

1379
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,759
And if I have done
this thing,

1380
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,662
as they say I have,

1381
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:44,832
I'm better out
of the way.

1382
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:47,702
As for the other thing,

1383
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:50,738
if you're a friend to me,
you couldn't do it.

1384
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,741
Lock yourself up
in your own room...

1385
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:54,809
For one day.

1386
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:57,244
Only for one day and see.

1387
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:00,681
Tell me what
I want to know,

1388
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:03,884
I'll have you out
of here altogether.

1389
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,688
What is that?

1390
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:08,623
I can tell you.

1391
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:10,324
Tell me
the name of the man

1392
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:12,259
discussed by you
and Edna Druce.

1393
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:15,663
I've said
so many times before.

1394
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:18,966
He has no connection
with the case.

1395
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,167
Besides,

1396
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:22,870
I didn't quarrel.

1397
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:28,709
Edna Druce tried to say
poisonous things about him.

1398
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:31,846
And I just put
my fingers in my ears

1399
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:33,414
and kept them there.

1400
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:36,083
So that you actually
couldn't hear a sound.

1401
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:38,252
You couldn't have heard
of any other person

1402
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:39,787
that had come
into the room.

1403
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:42,123
No. I suppose I couldn't.

1404
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:45,126
Why wouldn't
you listen to her?

1405
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:48,029
Because...

1406
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,899
I knew what Edna was
trying to tell me.

1407
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:55,269
What was she trying
to tell you?

1408
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:58,739
I can't answer that.

1409
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,741
It involved...

1410
01:18:00,743 --> 01:18:01,742
Somebody else.

1411
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:02,843
Plenty of other people

1412
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,845
have been involved
in this case.

1413
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,248
Markham, Stewart,
Druce...Fane.

1414
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:10,818
Why shouldn't this one
man's name be known?

1415
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,219
There was something...

1416
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:15,856
Something he daren't
have known.

1417
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:18,259
But which you knew.

1418
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,960
Yes.

1419
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:21,762
What was it?

1420
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,401
You realize
what you're admitting

1421
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:29,770
by your silence?

1422
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:34,842
Because you know you're
in love with him.

1423
01:18:34,844 --> 01:18:37,745
Oh, but that's impossible.

1424
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:39,880
Impossible? Why should
it be impossible?

1425
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:43,217
I see no reason why it
should be impossible.

1426
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,287
Why, the man's
a half-caste.

1427
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,056
What's that?

1428
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,292
What did you say?

1429
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,828
A half-caste? Black blood!

1430
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:57,732
Why haven't you
said so much?

1431
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:59,066
Tell me the rest.

1432
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,302
What was his name?

1433
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,138
I won't tell you that.

1434
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,841
Will this help you
to remember the name

1435
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:09,310
of the man you were
quarelling about?

1436
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:10,377
Stewart's
cigarette case?

1437
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:14,281
That's not one
of Stewart's things.

1438
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:17,818
You mustn't give the
prisoner anything here, sir.

1439
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,520
And the time
for the interview

1440
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:21,489
has nearly ended, sir.

1441
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,923
Oh, sir John.

1442
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,392
For these last
few moments,

1443
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:28,329
let's talk
about something else.

1444
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:30,865
Yes.

1445
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,804
There was a photograph
of me in your room.

1446
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:37,838
How did you know?

1447
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,207
I went there
to make inquiries.

1448
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:43,177
How did you
come to get it?

1449
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,513
I've always been
keen on the stage

1450
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:48,816
ever since I was
a little girl.

1451
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:51,519
One has one's heroes.

1452
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:55,189
That's why I came
to you for a job.

1453
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,025
And I sent you away.

1454
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,396
Oh, let's talk
some more quickly.

1455
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:05,533
Diana, I...

1456
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:09,003
Miss Mitcham sent me
some of my things.

1457
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:10,905
Your photograph with them.

1458
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:13,908
I've got it in my cell now.

1459
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,142
They let us keep some--

1460
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,545
come. Time's up please.

1461
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,919
Good-bye.

1462
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:28,055
I'm going
to find Fane.

1463
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:34,094
Handell Fane.
Handell Fane.

1464
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:36,230
What's become
of Handell Fane?

1465
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:38,999
Any news of Fane
yet, Markham?

1466
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,835
Not yet, sir John.

1467
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:43,003
I'm trying some more
of the agents though.

1468
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,405
Haven't you found
Fane yet, Ted?

1469
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:45,873
I can't bear
the suspense.

1470
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,575
We shall be up all
night, you know.

1471
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:50,110
Oh, for god's sake.

1472
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:51,445
Hello? Hello?

1473
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,581
Hello? Is that
lambersee agents?

1474
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,416
Yes. You found Fane yet?

1475
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:58,385
He's wanted for an
important job, you know.

1476
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,487
Yes, at once.
What's that?

1477
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:02,857
Gone back
to his old job?

1478
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:05,492
What? Trapeeze artist?

1479
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:07,995
Under what name?

1480
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:09,897
Where?

1481
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,165
No, can't stop now.

1482
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:13,434
Got him at last.

1483
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,407
Yes, that's him all right.

1484
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:23,177
Dressed up as a woman, eh?

1485
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:25,880
Always was good at that.

1486
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:29,283
An extremely clever
way of hiding.

1487
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,353
Markham?

1488
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:33,554
Yes, sir?

1489
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,956
I've an idea.

1490
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,492
You know your <i>Hamlet?</i>

1491
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:40,261
Every line of it, sir.

1492
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:43,030
Then let me suggest
for your consideration

1493
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:46,200
the series of events
embodied in act 3, scene 2.

1494
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:49,904
That's the play scene,
isn't it, sir?

1495
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,506
Yes. The play scene.

1496
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:54,942
Do you remember
the title...

1497
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,976
<i>The mousetrap?</i>

1498
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,411
Yes.

1499
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,980
Well, when he comes
to my theatre

1500
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:02,316
to read a part
I shall offer him,

1501
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:04,051
there'll be 3 of us.

1502
01:22:04,053 --> 01:22:06,387
2 cats to one mouse.

1503
01:22:06,389 --> 01:22:10,991
Yes, but what
about the cheese, sir?

1504
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,694
The cheese, yes.

1505
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:16,263
The cheese will be
a fat part, Markham.

1506
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:19,033
A villain's part
in the blood and thunder

1507
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:22,536
in a play that I'm going to
write especially for him.

1508
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:27,474
A play based on a recent
well-known murder case.

1509
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:30,277
I imagine he will
play his part,

1510
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,714
as I hope we shall
convince him...

1511
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:35,683
To the life.

1512
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,144
Come in.

1513
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,113
Can you give me
a minute?

1514
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,481
Certainly.

1515
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:11,719
Oh. Who is that
you have with you?

1516
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:16,156
Of course, I remember.

1517
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,058
This is the gentleman
you suggested.

1518
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,227
Yes, sir John.
mr. Handell Fane.

1519
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:23,564
Oh, yes.
Do come in?

1520
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,100
How do you do?

1521
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,301
How do you do?

1522
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:29,236
Sit down.

1523
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,111
Here you are.

1524
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:39,079
Oh, thank you.

1525
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,586
Oh.

1526
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:51,525
Thank you.

1527
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:54,061
No, Bennett, don't go.

1528
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:56,563
I may need you.

1529
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:59,733
You see, I always conduct
these interviews so badly,

1530
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:02,202
I'm just as likely
as not to leave out

1531
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,804
the really important points.

1532
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:07,541
Now, I suppose I better
begin by an explanation.

1533
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,777
I dare say
mr. Bennett has told you

1534
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:11,178
the author of the play?

1535
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:13,080
No, sir John.
I understand you wish

1536
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:15,783
that to be kept a secret
for the time being.

1537
01:24:15,785 --> 01:24:17,751
Well, I wrote the play.

1538
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:19,053
That was a simple matter,

1539
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,487
but it's proving
astonishingly difficult

1540
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:24,758
to find the right person
for one particular part.

1541
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,694
Might I ask you to stand
up for one moment?

1542
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:29,630
Of course.

1543
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:36,170
You know, Bennett,
he looks it.

1544
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:38,238
He looks it
quite perfectly.

1545
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,075
Exactly what I've
been thinking, sir John.

1546
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:44,812
Would you mind--
oh, sit down, do.

1547
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,082
Would you mind reading
one or 2 lines?

1548
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,217
You know, just
to give me some idea?

1549
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:54,521
Tell--what's his name--
Baldwin to bring me

1550
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,390
a clean copy of act 3.

1551
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:58,158
Thank you.

1552
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:01,762
Sir John?

1553
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,764
Might I ask you...

1554
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:07,134
What kind of play
is this exactly?

1555
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:09,770
Well, you may
question  my taste,

1556
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,105
but as an artist,

1557
01:25:11,107 --> 01:25:13,674
you'll understand
my temptation.

1558
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,514
My subject, mr. Fane,

1559
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:24,685
is the inner history
of the Baring case.

1560
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:31,191
Ohh. Thank you.

1561
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:32,659
Really? Your...

1562
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:35,696
Your indifference
astonishes me.

1563
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,564
Aren't I right
in thinking

1564
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:38,665
that you were a member

1565
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,834
of the Druce company
at the time?

1566
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,837
Then you knew
both women concerned.

1567
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:47,207
Yes, I knew them
both quite well.

1568
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,221
Now, let's begin.

1569
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,323
Oh, by the way,
mr. Fane,

1570
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,459
I understand you're
appearing at present

1571
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:08,262
at the circus.
Would that interfere?

1572
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:09,830
No, it was my old job,

1573
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,431
and I've gone back to it

1574
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:13,233
because times have been
a little difficult and--

1575
01:26:13,235 --> 01:26:16,203
however, I understand
you wouldn't be starting

1576
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:17,771
for 2 or 3 weeks.

1577
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,741
No, I don't suppose so, no.

1578
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,914
Let me give you...

1579
01:26:26,916 --> 01:26:29,416
Some idea of the scene.

1580
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:34,321
Here is a table in front
of a fireplace,

1581
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,789
more or less a ....

1582
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:40,194
On the table there's
the remains of a meal.

1583
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:44,831
And, of course,
the brandy flask.

1584
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,334
You know, mr. Fane,

1585
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:50,204
of course, you know all
the details of the case.

1586
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:51,705
I can't help wondering,

1587
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,607
why nothing
spectacular developed

1588
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:57,311
in connection
with the brandy.

1589
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:59,313
Thinking as a dramatist,

1590
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:01,348
I can't help feeling
that the brandy

1591
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:05,786
was not exploited with
sufficient imagination.

1592
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,321
Then, of course,

1593
01:27:07,323 --> 01:27:10,958
the law has no sense
of drama, has it?

1594
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:11,959
No.

1595
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:13,460
No.

1596
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:16,396
Then again,
let me see.

1597
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:20,334
I thought it best
to begin from a point

1598
01:27:20,336 --> 01:27:23,303
just before
the actual murder.

1599
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:32,512
There's a short scene
between the 2 women...

1600
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:35,382
Which turns
into a quarrel.

1601
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:37,384
In the middle of it,

1602
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:38,585
you make your entrance,

1603
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:41,788
on the words--I got
this from the evidence--

1604
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:46,293
"friends? I can tell you
things about your friends

1605
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:48,495
that you don't know."

1606
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:52,332
Just carry on from
that point, would you?

1607
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,976
Now, how on earth
did you know

1608
01:28:02,978 --> 01:28:05,812
the entrance was
from the window?

1609
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:08,348
That's highly clever.

1610
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,651
And look, mr. Fane,

1611
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:13,854
you've forgotten
your script.

1612
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,629
The script.

1613
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,970
Now, where are we?

1614
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,740
"Friends? I can tell
you things..."

1615
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:37,411
Wouldn't it be better if
I were to pick up the poker

1616
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:42,049
before I made the entrance
to the room?

1617
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:51,558
Excellent idea.
I'll put that in.

1618
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:58,598
Thank you.

1619
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,403
May I have the poker?

1620
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:08,408
No, I'm terribly sorry.

1621
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,445
We only have
electric fires here.

1622
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:14,414
Would this pencil do?

1623
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,430
Very well.

1624
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:32,399
We must get on
without the poker.

1625
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:35,469
You can use
your imagination, eh?

1626
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,938
Now then...

1627
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:40,107
Through the window,

1628
01:29:40,109 --> 01:29:42,609
into the room.

1629
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,545
You creep through
the double doors.

1630
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:49,449
The 2 women are
facing each other.

1631
01:29:49,451 --> 01:29:50,650
You come slowly around,

1632
01:29:50,652 --> 01:29:52,552
taking care
not to be heard

1633
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,821
and gradually you
approach the one

1634
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:56,556
whose back is to you.

1635
01:29:56,558 --> 01:30:00,394
Now, you raise the poker
that is in your hand

1636
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:01,895
as the other woman
says...

1637
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:07,801
"You fool! Don't you know
that he's a half--"

1638
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:35,562
what a pity, sir John.

1639
01:30:35,564 --> 01:30:38,999
The scene isn't finished.

1640
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:45,672
I was getting quite
worked up to it.

1641
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,548
I thought perhaps...

1642
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:59,519
You might be able
to collaborate with us.

1643
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,943
I'm so sorry, sir John.

1644
01:31:22,945 --> 01:31:30,584
I'm afraid I understand
so little about playwriting.

1645
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:37,057
Perhaps later on...

1646
01:31:37,059 --> 01:31:39,259
When the script
is finished...

1647
01:31:39,261 --> 01:31:44,564
You'll allow me to give
you another reading.

1648
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:16,630
Find out what time
Fane comes on tonight.

1649
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:40,120
I shan't be...

1650
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:00,140
How do you do, sir John?

1651
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:06,713
Who'd have thought
of seeing you here?

1652
01:33:06,715 --> 01:33:08,582
Well, you see,
I'm, uh...

1653
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:11,318
I'm working for
sir John now.

1654
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,920
Yes. mr. Markham
is helping me

1655
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,156
with my new play.

1656
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:20,827
I suppose
you find brandy

1657
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,729
steadying
for the nerves?

1658
01:33:22,731 --> 01:33:26,666
Mine's very nerving work,
you see, sir John?

1659
01:33:26,668 --> 01:33:29,836
You never know
what may happen.

1660
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,772
Hurry up. You're next.

1661
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:36,810
I presume you've come
to talk to me about...

1662
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:39,646
That part again, sir John.

1663
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:42,716
You know perfectly well
what I've come here for.

1664
01:33:43,652 --> 01:33:44,751
Hurry up, Fane.

1665
01:33:44,753 --> 01:33:45,619
There'll be a wait

1666
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:46,753
if you're
not careful.

1667
01:33:46,755 --> 01:33:47,821
If it isn't....

1668
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:49,689
How are you,
sir John?

1669
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:51,658
Come to see
the show?

1670
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,259
No, not exactly.

1671
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:56,696
I've really come
to see mr. Fane.

1672
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,934
Sir John,
if you wouldn't mind

1673
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:03,770
coming down to see me
after my act,

1674
01:34:03,772 --> 01:34:05,205
I shall only
be too pleased

1675
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,873
to talk over
that little matter

1676
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,875
we were discussing.

1677
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:26,292
For god's sakes,
play something!

1678
01:39:41,509 --> 01:39:45,078
Fane says he has
decided to colloborate

1679
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,147
in my play after all.

1680
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:49,983
He says...

1681
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,985
"The 2 women
are standing

1682
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:54,454
"facing each other
in dead silence.

1683
01:39:54,456 --> 01:39:57,423
"They are so lost in the
tension  of the moment

1684
01:39:57,425 --> 01:40:00,026
"that they do not hear
the murderer creep through

1685
01:40:00,028 --> 01:40:02,261
"the double doors
into the room.

1686
01:40:02,263 --> 01:40:04,197
"The murdered woman is at
that instant going to speak.

1687
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:08,034
"The murderer
springs forward.

1688
01:40:08,036 --> 01:40:10,770
"He hurls
the first woman aside.

1689
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:12,238
"She is stunned
by the fall,

1690
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,273
"but he doesn't
notice it.

1691
01:40:14,275 --> 01:40:15,341
"Infuriated,

1692
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:17,710
"he strikes out
at the other woman

1693
01:40:17,712 --> 01:40:18,778
"with the poker.

1694
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:21,347
"She falls
by the fireplace,

1695
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:23,182
"she's dead.

1696
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:26,619
"He nearly faints
at the sight of the blood.

1697
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:28,287
"He drinks the brandy,

1698
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:32,025
"then he sees the other
woman beginning to stir.

1699
01:40:32,027 --> 01:40:33,192
"He must get away...

1700
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,228
"Through the back window.
A leap or two.

1701
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:40,033
Finally, a climb into
the theatre dressing room."

1702
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:42,468
That accounts
for the broken basin.

1703
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:46,672
"But how to get home
undetected from the theatre.

1704
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:51,044
An idea. The policeman's
uniform he wore on the stage."

1705
01:40:51,046 --> 01:40:53,513
There's your policeman,
Markham.

1706
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:56,215
"He walks home
a murderer.

1707
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:58,217
"A murderer
on an impulse.

1708
01:40:58,219 --> 01:41:00,053
"The silence of
the mouth of a woman

1709
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:03,122
"who knew his secret and
was going to reveal it

1710
01:41:03,124 --> 01:41:05,058
"to the woman
he dared to love.

1711
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:08,461
There's a melodrama
for you, sir John."

1712
01:41:09,596 --> 01:41:11,431
Well, Markham...

1713
01:41:11,433 --> 01:41:14,167
You have it all.

1714
01:41:14,169 --> 01:41:16,369
Poor devil.

1715
01:41:16,371 --> 01:41:18,471
And Diana Baring...

1716
01:41:18,473 --> 01:41:21,074
She knew all the time...

1717
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:23,476
He was a half-caste.

1718
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:08,688
