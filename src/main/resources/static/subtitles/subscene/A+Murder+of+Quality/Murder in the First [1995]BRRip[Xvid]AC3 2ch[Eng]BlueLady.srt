1
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,359
They're coming. Run!

2
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:43,964
- No. Come on, this way.
- I think I see them, Mr. Glenn.

3
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,323
- To the water.
- They're heading for the beach.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,445
- Down by the beach.
- Look out. Run.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,761
No. Doc, no!

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,889
- Don't stop moving.
- They're down there, Mr. Glenn.

7
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,689
- There they go.
- Okay.

8
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,085
- Lay down.
- Hurry up.

9
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,966
Lay down or I'll shoot you, goddamn it.

10
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:01,366
- Hurry up.
- Lay down!

11
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,204
That's right, shoot them!

12
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:13,933
I give up, Mr. Glenn. Please

13
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:16,449
- Shut up, Henri.
- Please, don't hit me. Please.

14
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,653
Clean him up. Take him to the hole.

15
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,094
And call the press.

16
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,774
Dateline, San Francisco.

17
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:27,212
Alcatraz was the scene last night
of a dramatic escape attempt.

18
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:29,288
Four desperate prisoners
were apprehended...

19
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,609
...on the rocky beach below the prison.

20
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:35,129
The recently completed
Golden Gate Bridge serves as a backdrop

21
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:38,650
So near, yet so far from freedom
the surviving escapees...

22
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:42,334
...Henri Young and Rufus McCain,
are escorted back to lockup...

23
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,374
...while their less-fortunate cohorts
are destined for the morgue.

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,896
The body of Doc Barker,
son of the infamous Ma Barker...

25
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,020
...lies bullet-riddled,
cooling on a steel gurney...

26
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,977
...attended by a triumphant guard.

27
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:00,938
The squad of jubilant correctional officers
who foiled the escape...

28
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:05,382
...congratulate each other
and reluctantly show their battle scars.

29
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:09,103
A proud Warden Humson,
supervisor of three penitentiaries...

30
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:13,423
...Folsom, San Quentin and Alcatraz,
and confidant of J. Edgar Hoover...

31
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,464
...congratulates his troops.

32
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:17,821
Uphold the honor of Alcatraz.

33
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,098
Humson returns to his duties...

34
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,898
...as the inmates are sent
through metal detectors...

35
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,907
...cells are searched,
extra guards are called up

36
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:30,664
...and Alcatraz goes on full alert
to forestall any additional trouble.

37
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,020
As public interest reached a frenzy...

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,504
Warden Humson
and Associate Warden Glenn...

39
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:39,269
...left the island in the bay
for a press conference...

40
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,028
...headed for the San Francisco City Hall...

41
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,422
...which was inundated
with a veritable plethora of reporters...

42
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:50,383
...from around the globe,
all gathered to hear the official reaction.

43
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:55,748
Associate Warden Milton Glenn
introduces Warden John Humson.

44
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,665
Warden Humson will now make
a brief statement...

45
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:01,432
...and if you please,
no questions at the end.

46
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:02,709
Thank you.

47
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,073
I just want to reassure...

48
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,666
...the American people that...

49
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,915
...Alcatraz is an escape-proof prison.

50
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,271
They have nothing to fear.

51
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,551
The inmates, McCain and Young...

52
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,468
...will be brought up on escape charges.

53
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:21,193
There will be time in solitary confinement.

54
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,794
Privileges will be taken away from them.

55
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:28,118
And the whole rehabilitation process
will begin.

56
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:55,839
"To restore to a state of physical,
mental and moral health...

57
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,363
...through treatment and training. "

58
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,204
Hello.

59
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:09,359
Hello, hello, hello.

60
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,923
Eleven times eleven...

61
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:17,807
...121.

62
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,440
Twelve times twelve...

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,965
...144.

64
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,609
Thirteen times thirteen...

65
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,726
...169.

66
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,087
Fourteen...

67
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,803
When Henri Young
began his rehabilitation...

68
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:43,085
...I was in my first year of law school
at Harvard.

69
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,610
How long?

70
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:25,973
Alcatraz was opened...

71
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:29,253
...as a federal penitentiary
in the spring of 1934.

72
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,654
In the era of the gangster,
it was opened more for the publicity value...

73
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,181
...than the incarceration level.

74
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:38,415
Alcatraz was the most feared prison
in the world...

75
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:40,179
...and the most expensive.

76
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:43,695
There were only so many Al Capones
and Machine Gun Kellys...

77
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:46,180
...so the prison had empty cells.

78
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:47,897
In order to justify the costs...

79
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,861
...the government took incorrigibles
from other prisons...

80
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,822
...men that had committed smaller,
more petty crimes...

81
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,706
...men like Henri Young.

82
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,778
Hallowing be thy name.

83
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:02,143
Our Father who art in heaven...

84
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:05,540
...hallowing be thy name.
Our Father...

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,901
Prior to 1938...

86
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,188
...there had been five escape attempts.

87
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,420
No one had made it.

88
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,909
The reputation of Alcatraz as being
unescapable was secure.

89
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,505
Six inmates had died.

90
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:18,986
The ones who didn't die
sometimes wished they had.

91
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:34,066
The federal guideline
regarding solitary confinement states

92
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:39,114
...that the maximum stay for an inmate
shall not exceed 19 days.

93
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:52,557
Our Father who art in heaven...

94
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,869
...hallowed be thy name.

95
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:58,554
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

96
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,514
...on earth, as it is in heaven.

97
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,595
Give us this day our daily bread...

98
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,358
...and forgive us for our trespasses...

99
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,113
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

100
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:16,315
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

101
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,241
Amen.

102
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,513
Thank you, gentlemen.

103
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:47,359
Alcatraz is a half-mile
off the coast of San Francisco.

104
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:49,166
There were 276 inmates...

105
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,520
110 guards, with their wives
and children stationed on the island.

106
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,528
And the associate warden, Mr. Glenn.

107
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,249
This is the story of Henri Young
as I know it.

108
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:09,203
October 2nd, Game 2, 1936 World Series.

109
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,964
American League Yankees versus
the National League New York Giants.

110
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:17,850
The Yankees...
The Yankees score 18 runs, a series record.

111
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:21,573
Every single man in that lineup hits
at least once.

112
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:25,687
Every single man in that lineup scores
at least one run.

113
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,136
Daddy.
- Hello. Hello.

114
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:02,740
Have you been a good boy?
Here, take Daddy's lunchbox.

115
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,857
We'll go see Mommy.

116
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,039
Good news, Henri.

117
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,204
It's over. You're out of the hole.

118
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,439
You stink, boy.

119
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:21,602
I did it. I made it.

120
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:24,246
Unh, come on.

121
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,479
- Did good.
- I made it.

122
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,884
I did it. I did it. I did it.

123
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,048
Unh, come on now. Unh.

124
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,205
You did good.

125
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:35,886
The only other survivor
of the escape attempt was Rufus McCain.

126
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,730
He had betrayed his fellow inmates
by tipping off the associate warden.

127
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:43,090
McCain was rewarded
and left in the general population.

128
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,207
Henri Young was sent to solitary.

129
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,567
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

130
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:50,408
Okay, okay, okay.

131
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:51,568
GLEN
Henri.

132
00:11:55,245 --> 00:12:00,691
Some men are broken
by the laws that they break.

133
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:07,256
Unable to resist the forces
that are pulling them down.

134
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:11,776
Other men live by the rules...

135
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,849
...that society has set down.

136
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,851
You're not one of them.

137
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:34,933
Henri, I have a job to do here at Alcatraz.
Do you know what that is?

138
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:38,934
To protect you from yourself.

139
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:43,015
You were among the selected sinners
the state set apart...

140
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:45,498
...so that you could simmer in scum.

141
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:49,500
The good people of the United States
have decided...

142
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,904
...that you are better off here.

143
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,780
I had nothing to do with that decision.

144
00:12:57,457 --> 00:13:01,418
But where I play a part in your life is
to make sure that you stay here.

145
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,306
That you rehabilitate yourself...

146
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,507
...become a model prisoner...

147
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,823
...a better human being.

148
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,900
That's my job, Henri.

149
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,543
You, too, have a job.

150
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,144
And trying to escape...

151
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:21,629
...is not one of the duties
of your job description, if you follow me.

152
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,630
In life, Henri...

153
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:28,383
...for every action...

154
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:33,431
...there is a definite and distinct reaction.

155
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,431
Action...

156
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,193
- ... reaction.
- Yes, Mr. Glenn.

157
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,713
Now, if you escape, action:

158
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:46,554
I lose my job.

159
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,955
I have a family...

160
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:51,868
...that I will not be able to provide for!

161
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,631
I'm not done yet, Henri.

162
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,315
Now, knowing this information, Henri...

163
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,268
...can you tell me...

164
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:02,917
...why you would possibly
want to escape...

165
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,790
...and jeopardize my family?

166
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,076
I've done nothing to you but my job.

167
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:19,556
And instead of letting you learn
by breaking the rules...

168
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:23,718
...I feel I need to show you
how to obey them.

169
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,077
Tolerance.

170
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,955
Tolerance for pain.

171
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:31,122
My tolerance of you.

172
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:34,996
But tolerance can be mistaken
for kindness...

173
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:38,276
...and kindness can be mistaken
for weakness.

174
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,198
And we can't have weakness,
can we, Henri?

175
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,997
I understand. I'll- I'll- I'll be good.

176
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:45,762
I'm not gonna try and run again.

177
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:49,442
- No, you won't, Henri.
- Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

178
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,562
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

179
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,838
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

180
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:57,523
- Action, reaction.
- Action, reaction.

181
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,600
Good.

182
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,888
Good.

183
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,920
Good.

184
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:14,570
Take him to the hole.

185
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,086
Clean him up, take him to the hole.

186
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:17,683
Christmas, 1939...

187
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,244
...I celebrated visiting with my brother.

188
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:23,045
Henri Young celebrated in Alcatraz.

189
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,979
Stop it!

190
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,179
Get in here.

191
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:05,660
Please, no, no, no.
Please, don't put me back.

192
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,941
Please, don't put me back.
Don't put me back.

193
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,181
No. I don't want to. I don't want to.

194
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,098
No. No. No!

195
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,655
- ivy

196
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:19,535
- They sound great.
- Nice.

197
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:21,342
Merry Christmas.

198
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:23,579
- Very good, children.
- Really sounded good.

199
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:25,700
Standing round a flagpole

200
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,104
And he caught himself a head cold

201
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:30,821
Been singing it over and over.
I can't get him to shut up.

202
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,417
It gets on your nerves, you know?

203
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,344
In January of 1941...

204
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,417
...I had passed the bar exam.

205
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:39,459
Henri Young was in his third year
of rehabilitation.

206
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:40,578
No, Mr. Glenn!

207
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,383
Welcome to Alcatraz, gentlemen.

208
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,100
Step off the boat and onto the dock.

209
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,901
Eyes straight ahead at all times.

210
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,182
There was one boat
named after Warden Humson...

211
00:16:56,341 --> 00:17:00,303
...which handled traffic to and from Alcatraz.
In the morning and afternoon...

212
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:04,107
...it shuttled the school children
to San Francisco for classes.

213
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:07,307
It was also used to transport prisoners
to the island.

214
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:11,228
Whenever possible, having children and
prisoners on the boat at the same time...

215
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:13,185
...was avoided.

216
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,986
Don't look at the children.

217
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,589
I'll take the kids into the city...

218
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,590
...and we'll go shopping.

219
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:24,707
Honey, can I call you back?
The warden's here.

220
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,151
- Good morning, warden.
- Good morning.

221
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,953
- When did you arrive on the island?
- About 20 minutes ago.

222
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,112
Good.

223
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,874
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

224
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:38,710
Mr. Glenn...

225
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,910
...I've been going over
the rotation figures...

226
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,191
...in the solitary-confinement cells.

227
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,195
Is there something wrong, sir?

228
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:49,353
Well, I don't know.
I don't think this can be right.

229
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:50,636
What's that, sir?

230
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,072
Well, here, 244.

231
00:17:53,232 --> 00:17:56,714
According to this, he's been in there
since March of '38.

232
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,837
I don't believe there's been
an attitude change...

233
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:00,913
...with regard to 244, sir.

234
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:03,638
He's not like the other inmates.

235
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,038
But that's over three years.

236
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,595
He masterminded the escape attempt
in '38.

237
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,556
And there hasn't been an attempt since.

238
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,557
If you let those animals believe
that escape is possible...

239
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:17,121
...heh, you might as well stick in
a revolving door.

240
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,077
I think he has learned his lesson.

241
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,962
Come on, Henri. Let's go.

242
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,640
Henri Young had been rehabilitated.

243
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,287
I was now a public defender
in San Francisco.

244
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,881
We would meet in three days.

245
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,201
Eat, Young!

246
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,770
You know the rules.
You don't eat, you go to solitary.

247
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,923
Now, get with it!

248
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:49,327
Two times two is four.

249
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,403
Two times three is six.

250
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,687
Two times four is...

251
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,492
...eight.

252
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:57,968
Two times five, 10.

253
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:01,929
Twelve times eight...

254
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,853
...ninety-six.

255
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,649
Hey, Henri, McCain,
he put you in the hole.

256
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,292
Put you in the hole.

257
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:23,490
McCain's still here. Look.

258
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,329
McCain put you in the hole.

259
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:26,494
Put you in the hole.

260
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,054
McCain, put you in the hole.
Put you in the hole.

261
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:11,782
Get them back.
Get them back against the wall now.

262
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:17,587
- What happened?
- I don't know.

263
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:51,753
The United States of America...

264
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:53,107
...Henri Young.

265
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:56,267
Charged with murder in the first degree.
Approach the bench.

266
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,515
Charged with murder in the first degree.

267
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:05,429
"Henri Young, Rufus McCain,
in there, striking and wounding...

268
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:07,836
...sharp steel instrument,
to wit, a spoon. "

269
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:09,789
A spoon. A spoon? Heh.

270
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,509
This can't be right.

271
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,798
That's right.
- If you say so.

272
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,754
"To wit, a spoon,
about four inches in length...

273
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:19,835
...which, striking and wounding,
described as foresaid...

274
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,239
...caused the said Rufus McCain
thereafter...

275
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:26,834
...to wit, on June 11, 1941 to die. "

276
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:30,440
Trial set one week from Thursday,
June 22.

277
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,001
This court stands adjourned.

278
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:47,444
I know you can do it.

279
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:50,762
The fourth at Pimlico, the derby.
Come on, boy.

280
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,645
You can do it. You've got four furlongs.

281
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:55,598
Don't be cursing this streetcar.

282
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:59,479
Pick them up and lay them down.
Let those legs just pump like pistons.

283
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:03,884
Yes. Come on. The spirit is willing.
I can see it in your eyes, boy.

284
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,123
Aw, come on.

285
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,481
Pump and go.

286
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,128
Remember Jesse Owens
at the '36 Olympics?

287
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:13,686
Ha-ha-ha.
Maybe tomorrow, sonny boy.

288
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,366
Watch it, buster.

289
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:58,656
- Sorry, counselor.
- Jeez.

290
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,697
Gosh, you all right? Heh.

291
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,291
Mary, I'm sorry.

292
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,098
I'm sorry. Mary. you okay?

293
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,255
- Stop that now.
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

294
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,620
If Henkin saw us, he wouldn't think twice
about suspending me or you.

295
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,212
- All right.
- Fix your tie.

296
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:13,856
Why?

297
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:15,933
You need to look good
when you thank Henkin.

298
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:19,062
Thank Henkin? What do I wanna thank
Henkin for? The man's a cretin.

299
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:22,258
- He's given you a case.
- Case of what? Scotch?

300
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:24,455
Yes, James, a case of Scotch.

301
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:27,703
What, you mean an actual case
where I stand in front of a jury?

302
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:30,736
- Federal murder one, no less.
- Henri Young.

303
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:34,421
He's a convict who killed another convict
in front of 200 witnesses.

304
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,137
What? Wow.

305
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:37,704
Was it self-defense?

306
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:40,181
- With a spoon.
- What with a spoon?

307
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,503
That was the murder weapon.
Your client used the spoon to kill the man.

308
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,906
There weren't any
forks or knives available? Great.

309
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,783
My first case, I can't possibly win.

310
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:51,661
Do this one for the experience for the next
time when maybe your guy didn't do it.

311
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:52,823
You could learn a lot.

312
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,021
Go see your client
and make nice to Mr. Henkin.

313
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,788
- I'll see you tonight?
- Maybe.

314
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,348
Mr. Henkin, uh...

315
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,630
I wanna thank you very much
for your confidence in me...

316
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,750
I don't have any confidence in you.
The guy is guilty.

317
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,991
A monkey could try the case
and not make it any worse than it is.

318
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:10,910
- I see.
- Remember that.

319
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,267
- Thank you, sir.
- A monkey.

320
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,625
Heh. I guess I'm a monkey.

321
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,835
James Stamphill here to see Henri Young.

322
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:39,029
I need you to sign a release.

323
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,713
- It's a nice day, huh?
- Yeah, great.

324
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:17,719
Where are you going?
I wanna go into the cell, talk to my client.

325
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,164
What, are you nuts?

326
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,716
I'd like to speak to him face to face.

327
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:23,837
Well, ahem...

328
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:27,878
...you've already signed the release.

329
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,603
It's your life.

330
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,207
Hi.

331
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,729
So, then, Mr. Young, is it?

332
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,562
You're Mr. Young, is that correct?

333
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,691
Mr. Young. That is your name, isn't it?
Henri Young?

334
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:58,364
Why don't I just assume that's your name
until you tell me differently. How's that?

335
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:01,491
Mr. Young, I will be acting
as your defense attorney.

336
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,892
My name is James Stamphill
and anything you tell me...

337
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:07,886
...will be protected under the rules of
confidentiality and privileged information...

338
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:11,570
...of the attorney-client relationship.
So feel free to answer my questions...

339
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:13,974
...in a totally honest
and forthright fashion.

340
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:18,328
Now, just for the record,
your name is Henri Young, right'?

341
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,893
Mr. Young, this isn't an admission of guilt.
It's just your name.

342
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:28,729
You speak English?

343
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:33,494
Yeah, you do speak English.
It says so right here in the file.

344
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,818
Okay.

345
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:43,172
Mr. Young, I am your attorney...

346
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:48,941
...but I'm not gonna be able to provide
much of a defense if one of us is catatonic.

347
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:52,817
You see, we both have to at least
be able and willing to answer up...

348
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:55,178
...when our name is called, you know?

349
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,979
Can you hear?

350
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:18,026
Mr. Young?

351
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,942
You okay, Mr. Young?

352
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:24,308
Henri Young was born in Kansas in 1913.

353
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:29,584
His parents died 10 years later,
leaving Henri to raise his younger sister.

354
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:35,306
At the age of 17, Henri went into
a local store to try to get a job.

355
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:38,303
He was refused work.

356
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:43,784
Out of desperation, he reached
into the cash register and took $5.

357
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:48,065
The store also doubled
as the town's post office.

358
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:52,028
Henri was tried and convicted
of the federal crime of mail robbery.

359
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:56,869
Henri's sister was taken
to live in an orphanage.

360
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:00,714
He would never see her again.

361
00:28:01,906 --> 00:28:05,355
Eleven years later,
Henri would kill Rufus McCain.

362
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:34,716
Mr. Young, you went and killed a guy...

363
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:37,081
...so you're not catatonic.

364
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,202
So I know that you can talk.

365
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,918
Or at least, I don't know...

366
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:47,916
...maybe you could write something,
huh?

367
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:51,480
You wanna write something? Write here.

368
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:56,605
Something. Just...

369
00:28:56,996 --> 00:29:01,198
Look, you wanna give it a try?
You wanna write?

370
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,199
Just something, please.

371
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,688
Mr. Young, you're looking at me.

372
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,644
You hear me, don't you?

373
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,725
If you don't wanna answer my questions,
maybe we can start with something else.

374
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,326
What do you want, Mr. Young?
There has to be something.

375
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:26,411
It can't be to sit there, because if you do,
they're gonna stick you in the gas chamber.

376
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:28,483
Do you understand that?

377
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:42,485
Look...

378
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:46,287
...Mr. Young, I've read your file.

379
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,535
I am trying to help you.

380
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:52,611
That's all I'm trying to do.
I just want to help you.

381
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:58,329
Maybe there are extenuating circumstances
in your case.

382
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,331
Getting sentenced to Leavenworth
for stealing $500, that's extenuating.

383
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:06,050
Now, isn't it?

384
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,815
Look, Mr. Young, you have to understand,
I'm on your side.

385
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:14,132
- Five dollars.
- What, Mr. Young?

386
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:18,220
It was $5, not $500.

387
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,773
Bingo. I knew you had it in you.
Now, come on, Mr. Young...

388
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,453
...why did you kill Rufus McCain?

389
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:26,622
Come on, come on. You just talked.
Don't do this again.

390
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:30,222
Come on. No, no, don't quit now.
Come on, you just talked.

391
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,503
Why did you kill McCain?

392
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:37,863
Huh?

393
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:39,336
What? Huh?

394
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:41,541
- What are you saying?
- How...?

395
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:43,616
How? How? How?

396
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:45,185
Are you saying "how"?

397
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:46,626
- How.
- How...

398
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:48,425
- How?
- How...

399
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:50,586
- How...
- How...

400
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:54,547
How. What are you, a fucking Indian?
Come on, don't quit now. How what?

401
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,219
- How is...?
- How is... How is...

402
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,388
You wanna know how somebody is?
I'll find out.

403
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,904
How is...

404
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,980
- Who? How-?
- ... DiMaggio.

405
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,228
DiMaggio. How is DiMaggio?

406
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,225
What, is he a prisoner over at Alcatraz?

407
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:11,746
How is DiMaggio doing this year?

408
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:15,951
DiMaggio, the baseball player?

409
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:18,671
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,911
How is Joe DiMaggio doing this year?
That's what you're asking me?

411
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:23,428
Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:25,628
Yeah.

413
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:27,949
Yeah.

414
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:31,713
Mr. Young...

415
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:36,267
...I don't really follow baseball.

416
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:39,467
You know?

417
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:50,873
Excuse me, Mr. McNeil?
I'm James Stamphill.

418
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,034
Yes?

419
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,274
- I'm counsel for Henri Young?
- Yes.

420
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,158
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about a continuance?

421
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,839
- No.
- You don't understand.

422
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:00,836
He just sits. I can't get him to speak.

423
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:04,112
Maybe he's practicing for the gas chamber.
Tell him to take deep breaths.

424
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:07,513
Heh. Seriously, you won't even consider
a joint motion in the interest of justice?

425
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,634
Are you old enough to be a lawyer?
- Yes, sir, I am.

426
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:14,161
No joint motion for a continuance...

427
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:17,599
...no psychiatrist,
and trust me, pal, no plea bargain.

428
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:20,362
Your boy's gonna suck the pipe.
I don't know who you pissed off...

429
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:23,680
...to get this piece-of-shit case
and I don't care. No breaks.

430
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,566
Mr. Young, DiMaggio is having
a great year.

431
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:39,807
Last year, he was American League
batting champ with a.352 average...

432
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:44,127
...which was just a little bit off the year
before when he had a.381 average.

433
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,800
Now, the Yankees,
they too had a good year.

434
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,809
"New York defeats Chicago 4-0,
led by jolting Joe DiMaggio hitting.400."

435
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,646
Four hundred. That's pretty good,
isn't it?

436
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:59,326
June 17, 1941...

437
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:03,172
...our friend DiMaggio hits safely
in 32 straight games.

438
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:06,368
Twelve more and he will tie the record
held by Wee Willie Keeler...

439
00:33:06,523 --> 00:33:09,732
...who set the mark in 1897
for the Baltimore Orioles.

440
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:12,646
Joe Louis emerges the victor
in what some consider to be...

441
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:15,205
...the toughest win of his career.

442
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:22,847
Here we go.
Here's some entertainment news.

443
00:33:23,006 --> 00:33:25,375
Betty Grable. See?

444
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:30,576
It says here, she, uh...
She finished filming-

445
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:33,577
- How old are you?
- What, Mr. Young?

446
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,496
How old are you?

447
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:39,330
Me, I'm 24.

448
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,131
I think I am too.

449
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,972
No, you're, uh...

450
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,252
You're 28.

451
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:00,698
Mr. Young?

452
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:08,579
Would you like me
to keep reading to you?

453
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:13,896
Henri?

454
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,738
This ought to make you
a little bit more comfortable, Henri.

455
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,709
First, the defense requests a new jury.
Having been eliminated from this process-

456
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:40,105
Three new members.

457
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,946
And that's it. Next?

458
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:47,343
Your Honor, the defense respectfully
requests a continuance of 60 days...

459
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,027
- ... so I may confer with my client.
- Your Honor, he doesn't need 60 days.

460
00:34:51,183 --> 00:34:54,032
The facts in this case are so clear,
six minutes would do it.

461
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:56,464
My client has been almost catatonic
since I met him.

462
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:59,189
- Yesterday was the first day-
- He wasn't so catatonic...

463
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:02,870
...that he couldn't walk over and
slit a guy's throat in front of 200 witnesses.

464
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:07,751
Mr. Stamphill, is it your contention
that the defendant is insane?

465
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,274
Is that what you mean by "catatonic"?

466
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:13,387
Approach the bench, counselor.

467
00:35:16,188 --> 00:35:17,672
Is this laying the groundwork...

468
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:20,556
...for a "not guilty by reason
of insanity" plea?

469
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:22,153
I don't know yet.

470
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:24,350
I haven't even spoken
to him about the case.

471
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:26,397
- The first I've got-
One week, counselor.

472
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:29,910
Then you will either come in
and tell me you are ready to come to trial...

473
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,432
...or you will come in here with a request
for a competency hearing.

474
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,036
But, Your Honor-
- One week.

475
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:39,272
This court is in recess.

476
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:57,160
Mr. Young, you and me,
we've gotta talk now.

477
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,520
Would you like a cigarette?

478
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:00,964
No, thanks.

479
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,597
That shit will kill you.

480
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:07,282
That's kind of funny.

481
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:09,445
That shit will kill you.

482
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:12,807
I'm gonna die in that gas chamber anyway,
so that's kind of a joke, huh?

483
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,327
What's this about Nazis? We at war?

484
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,604
No, not yet, Mr. Young.

485
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,047
- It's brand-new.
- What?

486
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,208
- Mr. Glenn told me.
- The associate warden?

487
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,689
He says it's brand-new.
He said they're gonna try it out on me.

488
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:30,165
No.

489
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:33,291
Henri, you only have a week.

490
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:36,083
You've got to talk to me. Okay?

491
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:38,611
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

492
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:42,445
Henri, why did you kill Rufus McCain?

493
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:43,925
HQW?

494
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:48,493
How could you not know about baseball?

495
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,534
You said, "I don't follow baseball. "

496
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:54,530
- How could you not?
- Why'd you kill Rufus?

497
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:58,091
Over and over, it must have been
maybe a year, maybe more, I don't know.

498
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,047
All I did was hear them in my head.

499
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,296
What? What are you talking about?
Are you talking about McCain?

500
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:04,812
I'm talking about baseball.

501
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:07,217
I'm talking about
the great American pastime.

502
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:10,217
I went over every game
I ever heard on the radio.

503
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:12,334
I mean, I went over every game
I ever heard.

504
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,858
Just playing them over and over
in my head.

505
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,412
You had all those games to go to
and you didn't even care.

506
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,459
Henri, I'm talking about Rufus McCain.

507
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:26,136
And I'm talking about three fucking years
they had me in that bucket!

508
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:29,774
Three fucking years!
Without any fucking light even!

509
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,782
You had all those games to listen to!

510
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:36,058
You don't even know
what DiMaggio hit this year.

511
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,583
What kind of asshole are you?

512
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,259
Calm down, boy.

513
00:37:44,975 --> 00:37:48,217
Do you know the average length
of time an inmate would be in solitary?

514
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:49,380
Nineteen days.

515
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:52,942
- I understand, but he killed a man.
- Young did more than three years.

516
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:56,458
- Three years in total darkness.
- That's tragic, but he took a life.

517
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:59,379
Your brother's gonna tell you
you're not gonna get him off.

518
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:02,387
My brother is the best lawyer
I know. Somebody to tell me...

519
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:05,224
...we've got a chance
for some kind of insanity plea.

520
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,060
Your brother's not gonna give a damn.

521
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,184
Your client is a two-time loser.

522
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,225
This case is much more
about you than him.

523
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:15,389
He has no future.

524
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:19,066
This is your first time in the spotlight.
It's what you worked for.

525
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:25,148
This case is a lost cause,
so you must handle it like a lost cause.

526
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:34,674
Maybe you're right, but the guy's
not exactly Al Capone, you know.

527
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:36,866
No. No, he isn't.

528
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:39,230
All they had him on
was income tax evasion.

529
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:43,228
Your boy, they got on murder one.

530
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,791
Hi. How are you?

531
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:47,552
Hi, Henri.

532
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:48,875
Hey, listen.

533
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,396
You're not mad at me
for blowing up at you yesterday?

534
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:53,557
Because, you know, nobody talks back.

535
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,269
Mad at you? No, I'm not mad at you.

536
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:58,070
And I'll get the hang of it.
I got a sense of humor.

537
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:00,630
We gonna have some good times
before this is through.

538
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,831
You know how to play cards?
Could you get some?

539
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:05,479
Look, look, look, I set this up for you.
Here, sit down.

540
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,195
How much light got into the cell
you spent three years in?

541
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:10,435
Like when you offered me that cigarette.

542
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,796
I said, no, that shit will kill you.
That was pretty good.

543
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:16,041
Henri, you gotta help me
if I'm gonna defend you, okay?

544
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:17,797
Yeah, sure, sure.
- All right.

545
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,958
Look here.

546
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:25,635
Did you kill this man here?
Rufus McCain?

547
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:28,355
I must have. I'm here.

548
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:31,080
I don't remember it,
but everybody saw me, so, yeah.

549
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:33,564
- But you don't remember it?
- No. But so what?

550
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:34,764
Did you want to?

551
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,961
You know, once there was this spider
that crawled over me.

552
00:39:38,116 --> 00:39:39,557
It was like having company.

553
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,479
I looked for him again. I couldn't find him.
He had a way out.

554
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:44,841
McCain was the reason
you landed in the bucket.

555
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:46,798
One hundred forty-two times 93. Ask me.

556
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:50,560
- How long after you came out of the hole-?
-13,206.

557
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,924
Thirteen thousand. You mean, days?
What are you talking about'?

558
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,241
That's the answer, 142 times 93.

559
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,445
- Henri, concentrate on what I'm saying.
- I know what you're saying.

560
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:02,602
- How long was it?
- I don't know. Okay? I don't remember.

561
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:06,451
Hey, what's this new girl
I've seen in the papers? This Ingrid Berger?

562
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:08,763
She's some kind of looker.
You seen the movies?

563
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,891
- Goddamn it. I want you to think.
- I don't wanna think!

564
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:17,086
I spent three goddamn years in the dark,
smelling my own shit and piss...

565
00:40:17,244 --> 00:40:18,805
...doing nothing but thinking.

566
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:20,689
I hate thinking.

567
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,015
I'm sorry, Henri.

568
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:35,491
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:38,529
I'm just trying to help you.

570
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:41,012
Hey, you got a girl, right?

571
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:44,373
- Yeah.
- Take your jacket off.

572
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,538
- What?
- Let me smell it.

573
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,655
You were easier to understand catatonic.

574
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,294
- What's she like?
- Who?

575
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,855
Your girl. That's perfume on your jacket
Let me smell your jacket.

576
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:57,055
Look, I'll make you a deal.

577
00:40:57,212 --> 00:41:00,453
I'll give my jacket, pants,
whatever you want. Sports, girls, whatever.

578
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:03,253
But you gotta tell me just one memory
about something I ask.

579
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:06,979
- Deal?
- Sure.

580
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:09,338
Okay.

581
00:41:14,295 --> 00:41:15,855
I never been with a girl, you know.

582
00:41:23,096 --> 00:41:24,984
Let me try it on.

583
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:28,021
How long was it
that you went without any daylight?

584
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:30,065
Did they ever let you out
for any exercise?

585
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:33,266
- Aah! Please, don't hit me.
- Merry Christmas.

586
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:36,180
- Get the tear gas.
- How long I been in here?

587
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:39,024
- You're out of the hole.
- I made it. I did it.

588
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,229
It's Christmas, 1940.
You've been down there two years.

589
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,828
Two years.

590
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,868
I did it.

591
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,543
Two fucking years.

592
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:53,466
I made it. I made it.

593
00:41:53,623 --> 00:41:56,068
I'm not too crazy, am I?

594
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,068
I did it. It's over.

595
00:41:58,223 --> 00:41:59,664
Nothing's over, Henri.

596
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:03,064
Thirty minutes exercise,
that's all you get.

597
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:08,190
No!

598
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:10,386
You don't want it, we take you back.

599
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:12,826
No, no. I want it.

600
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:14,710
I want it.

601
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,708
I'll be good. I'll-

602
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:28,273
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

603
00:42:28,748 --> 00:42:33,791
...the defendant, Henri Young,
is accused of murder in the first degree.

604
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,196
It is your responsibility as a juror
to deal with truth.

605
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,596
Rufus McCain was murdered
by Henri Young.

606
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:47,356
Mr. Stamphill, the public defender,
will play upon your sympathies.

607
00:42:47,513 --> 00:42:51,442
He will use every trick in the book. Why?

608
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:53,797
To avoid the gas chamber.

609
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:58,756
The United States of America will demand
that you return a verdict of guilty...

610
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:02,243
...so that this... This animal...

611
00:43:02,395 --> 00:43:05,276
...will receive the punishment commanded
by the Bible.

612
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:09,685
An eye for an eye. A life for a life.

613
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:14,005
For if ever there was a man
guilty of murder...

614
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:16,165
...it is Henri Young.

615
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:20,887
And if ever a man deserved
to die for that crime...

616
00:43:21,038 --> 00:43:23,287
...it is the accused.

617
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,005
Thank you very much, Mr. McNeil.

618
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:35,529
Mr. Stamphill, are you prepared to make
your opening statement at this time?

619
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:39,611
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

620
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:45,011
When I was a kid, my heroes
weren't Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig...

621
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:47,050
...they were Clarence Darrow, Emile Zola.

622
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:49,889
In other words, I have waited
for this moment all of my life.

623
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,166
To stand like I am right now
in front of a jury of 12 good people...

624
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:56,730
...to plead the case of an innocent man
who's been unjustly accused.

625
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,286
The only problem is he did it.

626
00:43:59,446 --> 00:44:02,174
I know it, the prosecutor, Mr. McNeil,
knows it.

627
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:06,332
Henri doesn't know it because he can't
remember it, but he won't deny he did it.

628
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:09,696
All those witnesses the prosecutor's
going to bring forth will tell you.

629
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,729
Henri Young killed Rufus McCain.

630
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:16,414
So now that we all know that,
why don't we find the man guilty...

631
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:19,570
...and gas him because that's
what we all know is going to happen?

632
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:22,130
- Right, Henri?
- What?

633
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:27,616
There's only one problem that's gonna keep
us from wrapping this up in record time.

634
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:31,296
Henri Young did not act alone.
They haven't caught all the killers.

635
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:32,773
There was a co-conspirator.

636
00:44:32,932 --> 00:44:36,380
It is because of this co-conspirator,
whom we shall name in this courtroom...

637
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,978
...that Henri Young is innocent
of the crime of murder.

638
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:40,093
What?

639
00:44:40,254 --> 00:44:42,535
Objection, Your Honor. I must protest.

640
00:44:42,694 --> 00:44:44,058
I kind of figured you would.

641
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,015
Your Honor, this is absurd.

642
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:49,897
Before the counselor is allowed to waste
this court's time and this jury's time...

643
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:54,540
...I would request that he supply some proof
or evidence of this co-conspirator.

644
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:56,944
Mr. Stamphill,
can you bring forward evidence...

645
00:44:57,097 --> 00:44:58,984
...of the existence of a co-conspirator?

646
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:02,902
Not at this time, but it is my intention to
during the course of the trial.

647
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:06,660
He's not going to provide such proof
because no proof exists.

648
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:09,940
This man spent three years
in solitary confinement...

649
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:12,904
...during which time
no one had any influence over him...

650
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,105
...because no one had
any contact with him.

651
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,945
He came out of solitary.
He went directly to a shower.

652
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:23,183
Then he went directly to a haircut.
Then he went directly to the dining hall...

653
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:26,191
...where one convict had said
one sentence to him.

654
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:28,831
Your Honor, this does not
a co-conspirator make.

655
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:32,104
I'm inclined to agree with the prosecution,
young man.

656
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:34,425
Unless you can justify
that line of defense...

657
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:37,225
...I will sustain
the prosecution's objection.

658
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:41,269
The district attorney, with his own words,
has just made my case for me.

659
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:43,466
That'll be the day.

660
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:48,515
Your Honor, for three years,
three long, torturous years...

661
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:52,388
...no one and nothing had any influence
whatsoever over Henri Young.

662
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:53,988
No one and nothing.

663
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:57,476
This was a man whose only crime
was to steal $5 from a local post office...

664
00:45:57,628 --> 00:45:59,669
...so he could feed his starving sister.

665
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:02,469
He came to Alcatraz a petty criminal...

666
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:06,154
...who had never harmed or attempted
to harm another human being in his life.

667
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:09,878
And he came out of the dungeon
a vicious, barbaric, maniacal murderer.

668
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,551
A man who had been put
into a kind of psychological coma.

669
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:14,872
Within an hour of coming out
of that hellhole...

670
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:18,153
...he did what would have been unthinkable
to him three years before.

671
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:19,479
Unthinkable.

672
00:46:19,632 --> 00:46:22,840
His only thought was murder.
His only instinct was murder.

673
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:24,641
His first act was murder.

674
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:28,242
Now, he himself was a murder weapon,
but the hand that held that weapon...

675
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:31,842
...and plunged it into the throat of
Rufus McCain belonged to someone else.

676
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:35,519
I point to the associate warden, Mr. Glenn,
the warden, Mr. Humson...

677
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:38,163
...and the institution Alcatraz,
and say, "I accuse. "

678
00:46:38,316 --> 00:46:41,120
Objection.
- I accuse them individually and collectively.

679
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:43,841
I accuse Alcatraz of the torture
of Henri Young.

680
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:47,318
I accuse Alcatraz of the murder
of Rufus McCain.

681
00:46:47,477 --> 00:46:50,959
Silence! This court will come to order.

682
00:46:51,118 --> 00:46:52,843
Clear the courtroom.

683
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:55,443
Henri Young is not going to be
the only defendant here.

684
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,847
No. Alcatraz is on trial.

685
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,600
I will address your objection
tomorrow morning.

686
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,880
Henri Young, on trial for his life...

687
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,245
...is seen leaving
the San Francisco courthouse...

688
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:09,363
...followed by his young and now very
popular public defender, James Stamphill.

689
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:12,371
Stamphill has accused the infamous Rock
of torture...

690
00:47:12,522 --> 00:47:15,284
...using the tagline,
"crimes against humanity. "

691
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:20,725
Stamphill has turned the once-quiet trial
of a convict killing into a media circus.

692
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:23,045
In most cases, they do get better.

693
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:27,330
And in the case of Henri Young, uh...

694
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:29,649
...this happens not to be true.

695
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:32,774
Young is a noisemaker.

696
00:47:32,926 --> 00:47:36,571
Some prisoners have a problem
when they're in, uh...

697
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:38,134
...ahem, solitary.

698
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:42,533
All we do
is try to discourage misconduct.

699
00:47:42,688 --> 00:47:44,336
This is the first verbal attack...

700
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:46,333
...on the jewel of the prison system.

701
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,690
This bastion that houses evil
opened in 1934.

702
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,858
It brought gangsters like Capone...

703
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:57,692
...Machine Gun Kelly and Henri Young
close to the magical city by the bay...

704
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,256
...less than one half-mile
from world-famous Fisherman's Wharf.

705
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,572
We went to the streets
to find out public opinion.

706
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:07,256
That's ridiculous. You can't put a place
on trial. It's a prison for prisoners.

707
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:10,382
Now the murderers are accusing
the wardens of this and that.

708
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:12,334
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

709
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,654
Warden Humson seems like a good guy.
I like him.

710
00:48:14,814 --> 00:48:16,779
If that place wasn't here,
I wouldn't live here.

711
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:19,662
- You think it's too close?
- I think it's perfect.

712
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,739
He's innocent until proven guilty
and he'll get a fair trial.

713
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:24,904
But nonetheless, he's a murderer.

714
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:27,304
This grizzly evidence bears mute witness...

715
00:48:27,456 --> 00:48:30,861
...to the brutal crime perpetrated
by Henri Young.

716
00:48:31,016 --> 00:48:32,937
Note the spoon.

717
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:34,941
Can a prison be put on trial?

718
00:48:35,098 --> 00:48:37,499
Judge Clawson's ruling tomorrow
may clear the way...

719
00:48:37,658 --> 00:48:40,223
...to put Alcatraz on trial.

720
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:45,267
"The warden can be relied upon
to carry out the instructions of the bureau...

721
00:48:45,419 --> 00:48:49,620
...that no brutality or inhumanity
shall be practiced.

722
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:52,782
Sustained food and medical attention
shall be given. "

723
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:56,390
And we have wholeheartedly
followed those instructions.

724
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:57,742
Thank you.

725
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,866
So many opinions being expressed.

726
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:03,188
We attempted to get a statement
from the recent graduate of Harvard

727
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:05,831
...assigned to defend Henri Young.

728
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,953
Why don't we just keep the trial
in the courtroom? Thank you.

729
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:11,905
I would like to address a few words...

730
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:13,712
...to the counsel for the defense.

731
00:49:13,865 --> 00:49:16,146
Mr. Stamphill, you are hereby
put on notice...

732
00:49:16,305 --> 00:49:19,350
...that this court has no interest
in newspaper headlines...

733
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:21,515
...and will not be swayed by them.

734
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:26,916
And I further admonish that counsel's
attempts to try this case in the press...

735
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:30,593
...and not before this court,
will put him in the utmost peril.

736
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:34,393
Is that clear, Mr. Stamphill?

737
00:49:34,548 --> 00:49:35,628
Yes, Your Honor.

738
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:37,833
Well, good.

739
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,270
Bailiff, approach the bench.

740
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:44,074
Before I hand down my ruling
on Mr. McNeil's objection...

741
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,679
...I would like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

742
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:51,912
While I cannot give legal advice
and sit on the bench at the same time...

743
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:56,482
...I will express grave concern
with the defense's strategy.

744
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:59,361
Counselor, I strongly recommend
you walk a straight line...

745
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:01,194
...in terms of your defense.

746
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:05,916
Anything you state in this courtroom
will be evaluated not only by the jury...

747
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:08,159
...but very closely scrutinized by myself.

748
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:11,359
- Is that understood, Mr. Stamphill?
- Yes, Your Honor.

749
00:50:12,036 --> 00:50:13,640
Very well.

750
00:50:14,716 --> 00:50:17,444
Prosecution's objection is overruled.

751
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:20,041
Mr. Stamphill, you may pursue
your line of defense...

752
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:22,325
...concerning the penitentiary
at Alcatraz...

753
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:26,003
...and I will rule on any objections
on a point-by-point basis.

754
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:28,319
- Exception.
- Noted.

755
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,967
Mr. McNeil, you may call
your first witness.

756
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,088
Prosecution calls Terrence Swenson..

757
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,761
Court calls Terrence Swenson..

758
00:50:44,802 --> 00:50:46,482
Witness shall remain standing...

759
00:50:46,642 --> 00:50:48,684
...until sworn in.

760
00:50:49,123 --> 00:50:50,728
Put your hand on the Bible.

761
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:51,931
Cut it out.

762
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,407
Swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth...

763
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:56,888
...in the matter before this court,
so help you, God?

764
00:50:57,044 --> 00:51:00,210
So help me God.
- You may be seated.

765
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:05,090
Mr. Swenson, as a guard at Alcatraz,
did you know Henri Young?

766
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:08,815
- Yes, sir.
- Could you point him out for us?

767
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:11,650
That's him right over there, sir.

768
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:14,775
Thank you, Mr. Whitney. Thank you.

769
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:18,212
Now, on the morning of June 11, 1941,
where were you?

770
00:51:18,648 --> 00:51:22,654
I was on duty in the dining hall.
And everything was normal.

771
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:25,133
And I saw the defendant-

772
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,374
- Henri Young.
- That's correct.

773
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,095
I saw him standing over Rufus McCain.

774
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:32,292
He lifted up his chin and...

775
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:34,896
- Heh. Excuse me, I'm nervous.
- That's all right.

776
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:38,096
And he plunged a metal object...

777
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:41,896
...which I later learned was a spoon,
into McCain's throat.

778
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,614
He then ripped it open.

779
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:47,378
Did the defendant ever appear...

780
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:49,139
...to be ranting or raving?

781
00:51:49,294 --> 00:51:50,418
No, sir.

782
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:53,303
Mr. McKeon, was he frothing at the mouth?

783
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:54,622
No, sir.

784
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:58,103
Did he in any way give the impression
of one who was insane?

785
00:51:58,256 --> 00:52:01,421
Objection. This man is not
a qualified psychiatrist, as far as I know.

786
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,580
Sustained.

787
00:52:02,737 --> 00:52:06,742
So it appeared to you that it was a cool,
calculated and deliberate act?

788
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:08,982
- Objection.
- Overruled.

789
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:10,905
The witness may answer the question.

790
00:52:11,058 --> 00:52:14,179
Yes, sir. Young did it,
just as cool as a cucumber.

791
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:16,783
Thank you. No further questions.

792
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:20,148
This court will reconvene after the holiday...

793
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,144
...9 a. m., July 5th.

794
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,389
All rise.
- You should have played cards with me.

795
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:27,502
Alcatraz.

796
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:30,989
It was built by the military
during the Civil War.

797
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:35,550
In May of '33, the War Department
abandoned the island.

798
00:52:35,703 --> 00:52:39,992
It was leveled, all except for the lower floor,
which is now used for storage.

799
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:43,112
I have to get access to the lower level...

800
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:46,352
...because that's where the dungeons have
gotta be located.

801
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:50,827
The only guard on record to be fired
or dismissed during Henri's solitary time...

802
00:52:50,985 --> 00:52:52,906
...was Derek Simpson.

803
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:54,627
Locate Simpson.

804
00:52:54,786 --> 00:52:58,791
The prison opened in June of '34
under Warden Humson.

805
00:52:58,947 --> 00:53:01,675
He insisted on a high level
of guards to prisoners.

806
00:53:01,827 --> 00:53:03,836
Glenn was the first appointee.

807
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:06,632
Mr. Henkin.

808
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:08,589
First, you work for me.

809
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:11,477
- I was just on my way.
- Let me finish.

810
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:14,914
You work for me, which means
when I call you, you drop everything.

811
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,952
You return my call or you will cease
to work for me.

812
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,952
I don't care if you're holed up
with Rita Hayworth. Understand?

813
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:24,195
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

814
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:28,561
Now, what the hell
you think you're doing with this trial?

815
00:53:28,712 --> 00:53:29,957
Trying to defend my client.

816
00:53:30,113 --> 00:53:32,317
Then why don't you defend him
for chrissake?

817
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:34,919
Knock down the charges,
say it was a crime of passion...

818
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:37,923
...or figure out how
you're gonna cross-examine witnesses...

819
00:53:38,074 --> 00:53:42,156
...instead of this psychological coma crap
that doesn't mean anything in a court of law.

820
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:44,956
But, sir, I think it does.
As long as this is my case-

821
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:49,798
Fair enough. I tried to talk reasonably
to you, but you're not going for it...

822
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:52,838
...so you're not handling this case anymore.
Done.

823
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,722
Mr. Henkin...

824
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:58,643
...they're printing my opening statement
in 250 newspapers across the country.

825
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:02,160
If you wanna take me off this because
you're afraid of taking on Alcatraz...

826
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,727
...that's your choice.

827
00:54:03,879 --> 00:54:07,240
But I'm just gonna go to Jerry Hoolihan
and tell my side of the story.

828
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,601
If you wanna play hardball, sir,
I'll play hardball too.

829
00:54:16,802 --> 00:54:18,450
I'm trying to be your friend, James.

830
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,166
Do you know who the warden
of Alcatraz is?

831
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:23,724
He is the most respected warden
in this country...

832
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:26,284
...dealing with
the world's hardest criminals.

833
00:54:26,443 --> 00:54:29,292
If you try to make Humson
look like a Nazi...

834
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:32,009
...they will eat you for breakfast.

835
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:43,251
Henri, you are gonna die if I can't
get corroboration about what goes on there.

836
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:46,496
I need names. Names of men
who'll come and testify.

837
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:49,692
What makes you think
these men are gonna come and testify?

838
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:51,768
Maybe you got some friends
you don't know about.

839
00:54:53,328 --> 00:54:56,373
- You wanna play cards?
- I can get a court order. Make them testify.

840
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:58,897
What's your court order do for them
back on the Rock'?

841
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,331
Mr. Glenn gonna kill them, that's what.

842
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:04,372
This is the only chance we've got.
We're talking about your life.

843
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:08,253
For a smart guy, you're awful slow.
I'm already dead. I told you that.

844
00:55:08,411 --> 00:55:12,176
You know, you can't change Alcatraz
It just is.

845
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:13,621
So why fight it?

846
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:17,614
I see you standing up in court preaching.
I don't even know what you're talking about.

847
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:20,054
Justice. I'm talking about justice.

848
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:22,941
Jim, I killed him, they saw it,
they gonna kill me.

849
00:55:23,094 --> 00:55:24,938
Nothing you say
gonna make any difference.

850
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:27,496
So I don't see
what you got to get so excited about.

851
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:31,257
This trial doesn't interest you at all?
You don't care about it in the slightest?

852
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:35,738
Well, you know, you look like
you're having a good time, so I mean...

853
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:37,784
No, I don't care.

854
00:55:37,937 --> 00:55:42,302
Main thing is, I got a friend my age
to talk to till they gas me.

855
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:46,943
I'm not your friend, Henri, I'm your attorney.
I'm trying to save your life. Guard.

856
00:55:47,098 --> 00:55:50,187
You know, I had a sister...

857
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:52,740
...but I ain't seen her
since they put me in jail.

858
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,061
I got nothing. I got nobody.

859
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,309
I don't need a lawyer. I need a friend.

860
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,865
And this so you can prove something
to some guy named Darrow or something...

861
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:06,027
...you're not doing that for me.
Hey, hey, you wanna do something for me'?

862
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:08,343
Let's play cards.

863
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:12,708
You go ahead and play cards.
I got a case to try.

864
00:56:12,863 --> 00:56:15,744
Jim. Jim, Jim? Where are you going?

865
00:56:15,904 --> 00:56:18,228
Where are you going? Hey.

866
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:27,954
I'm Henri Young's attorney.

867
00:56:28,106 --> 00:56:29,667
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

868
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:33,188
I'm gonna call prisoners to the stand
to testify about life on Alcatraz.

869
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:34,952
I wanna know where the dungeons are.

870
00:56:35,107 --> 00:56:37,268
What solitary time
in those dungeons is like.

871
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,436
I want the jury to know and understand.

872
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:42,317
You tell them to get caught
robbing a bank. They'll find out.

873
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:45,190
I'm done talking.

874
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:01,517
Mr. Murphy, if we can get
decent treatment for you...

875
00:57:01,673 --> 00:57:04,358
...it makes decent treatment possible
for everyone.

876
00:57:04,513 --> 00:57:08,879
If we ignore cruelty in one place,
it makes it more acceptable everywhere.

877
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:11,282
I ain't gonna do shit for you.

878
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:14,119
You can't get me no good time
knocked off.

879
00:57:14,275 --> 00:57:15,956
You can't get me no privileges.

880
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:18,636
You can't even get me
seconds at dessert.

881
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:23,118
If I testify for anybody, I testify for the DA.
He's got some juice here.

882
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:29,522
Mr. Baker, could you tell me anything...

883
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:30,757
...about Henri Young?

884
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:33,122
Don't know Henri Young.

885
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:37,164
Could you tell us anything
about Mr. Glenn?

886
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:41,361
Warden Glenn has always been
good to me.

887
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,561
Have you ever been in the dungeons?

888
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,002
Ma'am, I don't know nothing
about no dungeons.

889
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:52,363
That's all, ma'am. I gotta go now.

890
00:57:56,003 --> 00:57:57,531
Fuck you.

891
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:58,850
Did Mr. Glenn tell you...

892
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:00,564
...not to cooperate with me?

893
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:02,207
Fuck you.

894
00:58:02,364 --> 00:58:04,765
Where are the dungeons located?

895
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:07,805
Don't take my fucking picture.

896
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:13,566
Did you know I can get a writ
of habeas corpus...

897
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:16,411
...that can force you to come
and testify in a court of law?

898
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:18,576
Fuck you.

899
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,291
Thank you very much for your time.

900
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,292
Don't mention it.

901
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:26,689
And you, sweetheart?

902
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:29,534
I'd like to fuck you.

903
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:47,574
Well, I hope your day has been fruitful.

904
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:52,015
I don't see your photographer.
Is he still taking pictures?

905
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:54,018
He's trying to.

906
00:58:54,173 --> 00:58:56,574
We're not receiving a great deal
of cooperation.

907
00:58:56,734 --> 00:59:00,259
It almost seems someone spoke to the
prisoners and told them not to talk to us.

908
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:03,459
There's no conspiracy.
No one talked to them.

909
00:59:03,616 --> 00:59:06,497
Maybe it's because they are
dangerous people who belong here.

910
00:59:06,656 --> 00:59:08,664
They have no interest
in you or your case.

911
00:59:08,817 --> 00:59:12,058
I would like to see the dungeons.
- I'm sorry? Dungeons?

912
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:14,538
The old Citadel, the sub-level of the prison.

913
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:19,140
That's mostly storage,
a few solitary cells. No dungeons.

914
00:59:19,298 --> 00:59:22,463
I would like to see
the solitary-confinement cells.

915
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:25,107
I would love to show those cells to you,
but I can't.

916
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,461
They're an insurance risk to visitors in case
of a riot. We won't be able to protect you.

917
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,465
Thank you for your concern.

918
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,781
I could show you
the exercise yard, though.

919
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:36,822
You have papers.

920
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:39,906
Yes, I have papers.
So you can cut the good-guy act.

921
00:59:40,062 --> 00:59:44,068
Mr. Stamphill, the fact is I do consider
myself as one of the good guys...

922
00:59:44,223 --> 00:59:48,272
...and perhaps more than you,
I know what the bad guys are like.

923
00:59:48,424 --> 00:59:50,825
No, no, no. I'd like to read them. Please.

924
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:53,545
Thank you.

925
00:59:55,145 --> 00:59:56,269
That is a court order...

926
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,754
...instructing you to permit us access
to the solitary-confinement cells.

927
00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:02,994
And allow the photographer, Mr. Kelly,
to take pictures of the same...

928
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:05,832
...to be used as exhibits in the trial
of People v. Young.

929
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:07,952
You are also instructed
to hand over to us...

930
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:11,752
...the complete medical
and disciplinary files as to therein.

931
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,513
If you refuse to do so...

932
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:16,309
you will have to appear in court
and show just cause.

933
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,438
Why don't you take
Miss McCasslin out for some air?

934
01:00:25,591 --> 01:00:28,952
- I was instructed not to leave you alone.
- I don't care.

935
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:32,113
You may be used to these conditions
but obviously she's not.

936
01:00:32,272 --> 01:00:33,560
We've already been searched.

937
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,594
Why don't you take her outside?
Or else we can go right to Glenn.

938
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:40,158
All right. All right. No more photos.

939
01:00:40,594 --> 01:00:42,002
You all right?

940
01:00:42,154 --> 01:00:43,321
Thanks, Mike.

941
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:44,642
I just need some air.

942
01:01:07,238 --> 01:01:09,126
My God.

943
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:31,972
Listen, my name's James Stamphill.
I'm Henri Young's attorney.

944
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:34,568
I can force them to let you out
so you can testify...

945
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,492
...in San Francisco in a court of law.

946
01:01:36,644 --> 01:01:40,606
You just have to give me your name.
I promise I will do what I said for you.

947
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:55,487
Hey, James, she's okay.

948
01:01:55,647 --> 01:01:57,415
Just needed some air.

949
01:02:00,649 --> 01:02:03,650
Can we go now?
- Feeling any better?

950
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:06,533
I guess I'll make it.

951
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,051
- Did you get anything?
- I got three names.

952
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,292
Let's go.

953
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:18,816
Where did Stamphill get
the three names on this list?

954
01:02:22,373 --> 01:02:23,540
I don't know, Mr. Henkin.

955
01:02:23,693 --> 01:02:25,657
You think you can trust these cons?

956
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:28,138
They're smart enough
to look after their interests.

957
01:02:28,293 --> 01:02:31,382
They told Glenn your boy James said
he'd get them out of solitary...

958
01:02:31,535 --> 01:02:34,263
...as long as they testify for the defense
and lie on the stand.

959
01:02:34,415 --> 01:02:35,419
That's a lie.

960
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:37,255
He wanted to find one convict willing-

961
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,544
Mary, Mary, this is goddamn bribery.

962
01:02:39,696 --> 01:02:43,537
It's prejudicing a witness. Conduct that
could get you disbarred. It's gone too far.

963
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:45,858
Fire him. And I don't care how you do it.

964
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:49,619
- Why do you have to make it be like this?
- Because Henri Young is my client.

965
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:51,939
- It's my job to defend him.
- Not anymore.

966
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:53,103
What?

967
01:02:53,258 --> 01:02:56,303
He's already been notified
that Henkin wants you off the case.

968
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:58,468
- Henri will never go for it.
- He went for it.

969
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:02,024
- He's been assigned another attorney.
- Who?

970
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,268
Me.

971
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,781
Me. Henkin assigned me to the case.

972
01:03:06,941 --> 01:03:09,703
He said I could take it or be fired.
I didn't have any choice.

973
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:12,743
- A choice to stab me in the back?
- Not stabbing you in the back.

974
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:15,587
- I'm trying to save your job and mine.
- What about Henri?

975
01:03:15,743 --> 01:03:18,264
What about, there's more to being a lawyer
than profit?

976
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:21,108
I don't have a brother
who's a partner in a big law firm.

977
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:24,833
There aren't any other jobs
waiting out there for me either.

978
01:03:24,984 --> 01:03:27,669
The only option I had was to do
what he told me to do.

979
01:03:27,825 --> 01:03:30,586
- What could I have done, James?
- I'll see you, Mary.

980
01:03:50,629 --> 01:03:53,117
What we need to do is establish exactly-

981
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:56,151
We have a lot of work to get to today,
if you don't mind.

982
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,511
Stop that, Mr. Young.

983
01:03:57,671 --> 01:04:00,311
Jesus Christ, all I was doing was looking.

984
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:02,238
I wanna set you straight about the way-

985
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:04,956
You set me straight
the minute you walked in here.

986
01:04:05,112 --> 01:04:07,393
- Mr. Young-
- Please, call me Henri. Please.

987
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:11,841
Mr. Young, I am not here to satisfy
any sexual fantasies that you may have.

988
01:04:14,714 --> 01:04:16,198
You're not?

989
01:04:16,434 --> 01:04:18,354
No, I'm your attorney.

990
01:04:18,515 --> 01:04:20,239
Well, they're gonna kill me anyway.

991
01:04:20,395 --> 01:04:22,436
You're not gonna do me any good
as an attorney.

992
01:04:22,595 --> 01:04:24,483
You might as well be good for something.

993
01:04:24,635 --> 01:04:28,117
- Mr. Young, I can't-
- Please, please, call me Henri, can't you?

994
01:04:28,837 --> 01:04:31,358
I just wanna hear a lady call me Henri.

995
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:33,001
Can't you, please, please?

996
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:35,205
Just once.

997
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:36,841
Please?

998
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:44,001
- Henri, listen, we have so-
- Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it. That's it.

999
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,724
Now I'm gonna touch you just a little.

1000
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,049
- Just a little.
- Are you crazy?

1001
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,765
Yeah, sure. It's not gonna hurt you
to let me touch you.

1002
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:55,649
Don't make me call the guard.
We're running late on this-

1003
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:57,286
Stop that.

1004
01:04:58,882 --> 01:04:59,887
Stop.

1005
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:02,051
Stop that. Stop that.

1006
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,331
What? I'm not touching you.
I'm touching me.

1007
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:07,764
Guard? Guard?

1008
01:05:10,924 --> 01:05:12,125
You have a problem, ma'am?

1009
01:05:15,205 --> 01:05:17,006
Did he do anything?

1010
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:22,211
- No. No.
- You let me know if he does.

1011
01:05:22,366 --> 01:05:24,134
No, I'd like to leave now, please.

1012
01:05:41,009 --> 01:05:43,737
He wants to see you in there.
- What?

1013
01:05:45,451 --> 01:05:47,492
He wants to see you in there.

1014
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:19,226
So why'd you wanna meet here?
Neutral territory?

1015
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:24,659
So you wanna be my lawyer again?

1016
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,139
Why? What happened to the other one?

1017
01:06:28,299 --> 01:06:30,460
I don't know if I want her.

1018
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,824
Since I had her, I mean.

1019
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,548
She was good, though.

1020
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,106
She was everything I wanted
my first experience to be.

1021
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:41,946
You know, I was just talking
and she came over.

1022
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:45,626
- She started touching me right on my-
- That's great. That's great, Henri.

1023
01:06:49,462 --> 01:06:51,383
Jim, I'm just playing a joke on you.

1024
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,988
I know she was your girlfriend.

1025
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:00,833
I remember from the smell of that perfume
on your jacket.

1026
01:07:05,466 --> 01:07:07,027
So, lawyer...

1027
01:07:08,227 --> 01:07:10,191
...you wanna come back?

1028
01:07:11,347 --> 01:07:13,115
I resigned.

1029
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:17,716
So I guess that means
I'm in private practice now, huh?

1030
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:21,197
I could have had her though.

1031
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:22,833
Of course...

1032
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,558
...she don't play cards.

1033
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,515
After I got arrested...

1034
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:36,039
...they took my little sister away.

1035
01:07:36,992 --> 01:07:41,718
They put her in a home or a orphanage...

1036
01:07:41,872 --> 01:07:43,400
...I don't know.

1037
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:47,559
I don't know what happened to her.
Never saw her again.

1038
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,842
My parents died when I was 7.

1039
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:51,555
It was just me and my brother...

1040
01:07:51,715 --> 01:07:54,236
...and he didn't know anything
about raising a child...

1041
01:07:54,795 --> 01:07:56,836
...so he sent me off to boarding school.

1042
01:07:56,995 --> 01:07:59,800
I did get to come home on holidays.

1043
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:02,324
And he put me through law school...

1044
01:08:02,476 --> 01:08:06,001
...then got me the job
at the public defender's office.

1045
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:10,118
He always wanted me to do well.

1046
01:08:11,438 --> 01:08:14,527
We had a plan until you came along
and messed everything up, Henri.

1047
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:18,808
I wish I had been able to take care
of my little sister, you know?

1048
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,725
I mean, family's family, right?

1049
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,285
Henri, I'm sorry you're here.

1050
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:30,846
Hey, this here's paradise
compared to my last home.

1051
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:35,087
So how about the case?
You wanna talk about that a little bit now?

1052
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:37,327
You never give up, do you?

1053
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:42,128
Okay, what about the Redskins?

1054
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,209
How do you think they're gonna do
against the Yankees this year?

1055
01:08:45,364 --> 01:08:48,649
Jim, the Redskins are a football team.

1056
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,053
Yankees are a baseball team.

1057
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:54,327
Personally, I think the Redskins
would kick the shit out of them.

1058
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,295
Henri, I'm trying.

1059
01:08:59,888 --> 01:09:01,012
I know.

1060
01:09:01,248 --> 01:09:04,369
This is gonna be
a private conversation, Byron.

1061
01:09:04,528 --> 01:09:06,809
It never took place, all right?

1062
01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:10,210
- Is that all right with you, Thurgood?
- I'm the one who suggested it.

1063
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:11,930
That brother of yours...

1064
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,890
...is making quite a little name
for himself.

1065
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,850
We've even heard his name
in Washington.

1066
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:18,214
My brother has resigned from the case.

1067
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:21,176
Well, he was hired back again last night.

1068
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,251
What do you mean,
he was hired back again?

1069
01:09:23,412 --> 01:09:25,496
Byron...

1070
01:09:27,053 --> 01:09:29,661
...since you made partner,
your work here has been stellar.

1071
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:32,061
- I would hate to see anything-
- What are you trying to say?

1072
01:09:32,213 --> 01:09:34,898
This administration is not going to allow...

1073
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:37,935
...public attention to be diverted
from all the good it's done...

1074
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:40,856
...by some kind of a witch hunt
in the Justice Department.

1075
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,503
I'm just telling you what the score
is, Byron.

1076
01:09:43,656 --> 01:09:45,980
It's up to you to take care of him.

1077
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,698
Why would J. Edgar Hoover care
about what happens to Henri Young?

1078
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:52,024
Grow up, James.

1079
01:09:52,177 --> 01:09:53,901
He doesn't care
about what happens to Henri.

1080
01:09:54,058 --> 01:09:58,947
He cares about Alcatraz,
the Justice Department...

1081
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:00,779
...Humson, the administration.

1082
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:03,460
He can't have some kid
from the PD's office-

1083
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:05,823
I'm not a public defender anymore.

1084
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,748
Don't play games. You know the point.

1085
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,742
Yeah. The point is I'm trying to do
what's right. I'm talking about justice here.

1086
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:15,863
You're disgusted about what happened
on Alcatraz. So am I.

1087
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:21,184
But if you tear the whole system down,
what does that say about America?

1088
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,111
We're wrong.

1089
01:10:23,663 --> 01:10:25,508
We can't be wrong.

1090
01:10:25,663 --> 01:10:30,465
The world is fighting right now
to preserve our system, our way of life.

1091
01:10:30,624 --> 01:10:32,512
You can't attack it blindly.

1092
01:10:32,664 --> 01:10:36,833
Byron, we're talking about one man here.
It's not that big of a deal.

1093
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:39,995
- You're under surveillance.
- What?

1094
01:10:40,186 --> 01:10:43,591
Everyone is watching you.
Tell me how you plan to continue.

1095
01:10:45,027 --> 01:10:49,349
You have to realize, no one will talk.
Everyone has been gotten to.

1096
01:10:50,588 --> 01:10:52,476
I have somebody.

1097
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:54,069
Who?

1098
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:57,630
I can't tell you.

1099
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:01,679
- So now you don't trust me?
- Byron, you're my brother. I love you.

1100
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,875
I need your help.

1101
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:12,477
L- I can't do it, Byron.

1102
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:15,120
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1103
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:17,997
I can't.

1104
01:11:29,516 --> 01:11:32,277
James, as a consolation...

1105
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:36,277
...please don't put Humson on the stand.

1106
01:11:36,716 --> 01:11:38,125
Why?

1107
01:11:38,997 --> 01:11:40,798
Humson was handpicked by Hoover.

1108
01:11:40,957 --> 01:11:45,726
It would save a lot of embarrassment
if you were to avoid Humson.

1109
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:49,247
I'll think about it.

1110
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,244
Thank you.

1111
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,924
I'm sorry, Byron.

1112
01:12:11,403 --> 01:12:12,844
Yeah?

1113
01:12:13,844 --> 01:12:15,252
Mr. Stamphill?

1114
01:12:15,404 --> 01:12:17,052
Yeah. Yeah, this is James Stamphill.

1115
01:12:17,204 --> 01:12:19,932
This is Derek Simpson.
Remember we talked before?

1116
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,126
Right, right. Of course.
Of course, I remember.

1117
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:24,609
Have you made your decision?

1118
01:12:24,766 --> 01:12:25,890
I've been thinking...

1119
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:29,212
...about what we were talking about
and I'd like to be a witness.

1120
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:30,891
Wonderful.

1121
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,971
Now, you do understand that
you'll have to testify in court under oath...

1122
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:36,289
...about the brutality you witnessed
at Alcatraz.

1123
01:12:36,448 --> 01:12:37,452
Yes, I know that.

1124
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,889
Particularly in reference to Henri Young.

1125
01:12:41,168 --> 01:12:42,816
I know some things.

1126
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:45,810
Mr. Simpson, do you hold
any sort of grudge...

1127
01:12:45,969 --> 01:12:48,218
...against Warden Humson
or Associate Warden Glenn?

1128
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,691
No.

1129
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:52,691
Why don't I just come over
and we can speak in person?

1130
01:12:52,851 --> 01:12:55,296
Yes. I'm in Chinatown.

1131
01:12:55,451 --> 01:13:01,377
It's an alley called Scotland Court.
The number there is 964.

1132
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:12,455
Mr. Simpson, are you in here?

1133
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:18,496
Mr. Simpson, are you all right?

1134
01:13:30,218 --> 01:13:31,866
You all right?

1135
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:35,260
Mr. Simpson,
you still wanna be a witness?

1136
01:13:47,701 --> 01:13:50,582
- Who's she?
- She's a court reporter.

1137
01:13:51,142 --> 01:13:55,071
- What happened to your face?
- My face had a little accident this morning.

1138
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,547
Listen, Henri, we need to get
one more deposition...

1139
01:13:57,703 --> 01:14:00,027
- No.
- ... regarding the beatings you received.

1140
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:01,984
Your eye, your leg. Everything.

1141
01:14:03,224 --> 01:14:06,345
Henri, remember when you told me
you'd never been with a woman before?

1142
01:14:06,504 --> 01:14:09,113
Henri, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Henri.

1143
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:10,509
Nice to meet you, Henri.

1144
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:14,114
You got about four minutes before
the next guard arrives, so you gotta hurry.

1145
01:14:14,266 --> 01:14:15,511
Now, I can't leave the room.

1146
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:18,711
I'm just gonna be over here in this corner.
I'll turn my back.

1147
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:20,231
We can get acquainted.

1148
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,470
Come on, honey, we don't have all night.

1149
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:31,597
Thanks, Jim.

1150
01:14:31,749 --> 01:14:33,998
You're a good friend.

1151
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:36,751
Boy.

1152
01:14:43,432 --> 01:14:46,880
- Um- Thanks. Hi, Charlie.
- Hey.

1153
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:48,080
What's the story?

1154
01:14:48,232 --> 01:14:50,873
The attorney and a reporter inside
with the prisoner.

1155
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:52,038
Is he shackled?

1156
01:14:52,193 --> 01:14:54,354
Yeah. Other than that,
everything's pretty quiet.

1157
01:14:59,154 --> 01:15:01,555
Sweetie, you have to get it up first.

1158
01:15:01,715 --> 01:15:04,564
That's like trying to stick an oyster
into a slot machine.

1159
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:06,680
Give me that.

1160
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:12,758
Aw, I- I ca-

1161
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:14,882
- I can't.
- You can.

1162
01:15:15,038 --> 01:15:17,919
- Yeah, you can.
- I can't. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1163
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:20,643
The 5 bucks you owe me.
- For what?

1164
01:15:20,799 --> 01:15:24,564
What, you didn't listen?
Louis knocks Nova out in the sixth round.

1165
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,841
- That bum.
- Yeah, yeah. Give me the money.

1166
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,167
- I can't.
- You can.

1167
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:31,165
I can't. I can't. I can't.

1168
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:32,761
- You can.
- I can't.

1169
01:15:39,482 --> 01:15:41,490
Adios, Charlie.

1170
01:15:41,763 --> 01:15:43,323
All right, kid.

1171
01:15:45,084 --> 01:15:46,044
You know what?

1172
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:51,165
It's gonna cost extra, you know.

1173
01:15:52,124 --> 01:15:55,006
Just do what you have to do.

1174
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,419
I can't.

1175
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:32,093
I'm sorry.

1176
01:16:35,933 --> 01:16:37,374
I can't.

1177
01:16:44,335 --> 01:16:45,895
Hey.

1178
01:16:47,015 --> 01:16:49,536
Hey, we only had a few minutes.

1179
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:53,298
You got another guy in the room.
That's okay.

1180
01:16:58,417 --> 01:17:00,938
Hey. Shh.

1181
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:04,106
Aw, shh, baby.

1182
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,339
Hey. Shh.

1183
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:10,627
Your Honor, the defense calls...

1184
01:17:10,779 --> 01:17:13,420
...associate warden, Mr. Milton Glenn.

1185
01:17:28,142 --> 01:17:29,747
Do you swear to tell the truth...

1186
01:17:29,902 --> 01:17:31,191
...and nothing but the truth?

1187
01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:33,831
- So help me God.
- You may be seated.

1188
01:17:43,505 --> 01:17:47,227
As associate warden, you are responsible
for the day-to-day running of the prison...

1189
01:17:47,386 --> 01:17:49,187
- ... are you not?
- You could say that.

1190
01:17:49,347 --> 01:17:51,072
You must be familiar with the dungeons.

1191
01:17:51,227 --> 01:17:52,231
Dungeons?

1192
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:53,828
I'm sure you've heard of them.

1193
01:17:53,988 --> 01:17:56,672
Some prisoners refer to the lower levels
as dungeons.

1194
01:17:56,988 --> 01:18:00,349
They refer to bread and water
as piss and punk.

1195
01:18:00,508 --> 01:18:02,953
Mr. Glenn, the dictionary definition
of a dungeon is:

1196
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:06,317
"A close, dark prison or vault,
commonly underground. "

1197
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:10,671
Now, the walls of those cells measure
6 feet by 9, and the roof is 5 to 6 feet tall.

1198
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:13,351
- Would you call that close?
- As a matter of opinion, no.

1199
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:16,360
- Are there any light fixtures?
- No, but there aren't any books.

1200
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:19,033
Your Honor, the defense
offers these photographs...

1201
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:21,516
...as defense exhibit B, C, D, E and F.

1202
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:24,717
How much light comes in
with no window when the door is closed?

1203
01:18:24,873 --> 01:18:28,039
- Not much.
- How long was Henri held in such a cell?

1204
01:18:28,193 --> 01:18:29,394
I don't know exactly.

1205
01:18:29,554 --> 01:18:32,916
Three years and two months.
I have the records here, if you'd like to see.

1206
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,203
- That sounds right.
- Three years and two months.

1207
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:38,880
In that time, how often was Henri Young
allowed outside for exercise?

1208
01:18:39,035 --> 01:18:43,358
Mr. Stamphill, I do not believe that
the exercise time of an inmate is relevant.

1209
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:45,001
Well, I do. Answer the question.

1210
01:18:45,157 --> 01:18:46,161
Objection.

1211
01:18:46,317 --> 01:18:48,685
Objection overruled.
- Henri Young tried to escape.

1212
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:52,079
Now, when a criminal escapes from prison,
he doesn't go job-hunting.

1213
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:55,807
He robs somebody or kills somebody.
We do all we can to discourage escape.

1214
01:18:55,959 --> 01:18:59,888
In three years and two months, how often
was Henri allowed outside for exercise?

1215
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:03,368
- I do not believe men sentenced-
- Answer the question I'm asking.

1216
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,009
How often was he allowed outside
for exercise?

1217
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:07,689
Objection. Badgering the witness.

1218
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:09,042
Objection overruled.

1219
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:11,483
Mr. Glenn, you will answer that question.

1220
01:19:12,802 --> 01:19:14,886
Young man, I do not recall.

1221
01:19:15,043 --> 01:19:16,364
Heh. You don't know?

1222
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:19,372
Surely a half hour a year
isn't too difficult to recall, now, is it?

1223
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:22,644
Mr. Stamphill, there is no place
in my courtroom for sarcasm.

1224
01:19:22,804 --> 01:19:25,969
Sorry, Your Honor. Mr. Glenn,
I have here a list with 32 names on it.

1225
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:30,086
Now, these are all men who were prisoners
at Alcatraz during your tenure. Correct?

1226
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:32,210
I can't remember the name
of every prisoner.

1227
01:19:32,366 --> 01:19:34,407
I have committal papers
with your signature...

1228
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:36,171
...as well as the late Dr. Wendell Kiley.

1229
01:19:36,327 --> 01:19:38,848
We'd like this to be marked
defense exhibit G.

1230
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:43,013
All of these men were taken off Alcatraz
in straitjackets and placed in institutions.

1231
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:46,213
- Is that correct?
- Objection. The question is immaterial.

1232
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:50,811
Immaterial? Your Honor, I'm saying in lay
terms that Alcatraz drives people insane.

1233
01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:52,737
It has already done so in 32 instances.

1234
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,694
If not true, the witness ought to have
the opportunity to say so.

1235
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,891
If it is true, it is most material...

1236
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,812
and the jury ought to be privy
to that knowledge.

1237
01:20:00,971 --> 01:20:03,416
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you.

1238
01:20:03,572 --> 01:20:08,777
Now, is it not true that these men
were taken off Alcatraz in straightjackets...

1239
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:13,134
...and placed in mental institutions and you
and Dr. Wendell Kiley signed the papers?

1240
01:20:13,293 --> 01:20:16,622
- True.
- Is it not also true that of these 32 men...

1241
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:19,940
...28 of them had never before set foot
inside a mental institution?

1242
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:22,660
- Ha-ha-ha. I don't know.
- I have their records if you'd like to see.

1243
01:20:22,815 --> 01:20:24,616
- Well, I'll take your word for it.
- Okay.

1244
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:27,538
Here are men who came to Alcatraz
legally sane...

1245
01:20:27,696 --> 01:20:31,221
...were subjected to the conditions
of Alcatraz, then deemed to be insane.

1246
01:20:31,376 --> 01:20:33,297
- Is that correct?
- Yes, but you can't say...

1247
01:20:33,457 --> 01:20:35,062
...that one causes the other.

1248
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:38,699
Well, insanity's not a virus, is it?
It's not something we're all going to catch.

1249
01:20:38,858 --> 01:20:41,379
Objection, Your Honor.
The witness is not a psychiatrist.

1250
01:20:41,538 --> 01:20:42,947
Objection sustained.

1251
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:47,548
Mr. Stamphill, confine your questions
to areas of Mr. Glenn's expertise.

1252
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,225
Very well. Mr. Glenn's expertise.
Have you ever beaten a prisoner?

1253
01:20:51,381 --> 01:20:52,582
No, that would be illegal.

1254
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:54,182
- Not even when provoked?
- No.

1255
01:20:54,341 --> 01:20:57,507
You've never hit, kicked,
used a blackjack or straight razor?

1256
01:20:57,662 --> 01:21:00,150
You've never punched a prisoner
in your entire career?

1257
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:02,191
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

1258
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:04,263
Confine yourself
to one question at a time.

1259
01:21:04,424 --> 01:21:08,625
Is it not true that you ordered two guards
to throw Henri down a steel flight of stairs?

1260
01:21:08,784 --> 01:21:10,913
That you smashed his face
with a blackjack?

1261
01:21:11,064 --> 01:21:14,513
That you took a straight razor, sliced open
his ankle, hobbling him for life?

1262
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:16,193
That's the truth, isn't it?

1263
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:18,834
- Objection.
- The witness has already testified...

1264
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:20,666
...he didn't beat any prisoners.

1265
01:21:20,826 --> 01:21:24,187
Are you aware that, in a federal court
system, perjury is a crime?

1266
01:21:24,347 --> 01:21:26,114
You could spend time in prison.

1267
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:28,187
I would remind you, young man...

1268
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:30,268
...Henri Young is the one on trial here,
not me.

1269
01:21:30,428 --> 01:21:33,277
I am a public servant.
I am not the bad guy.

1270
01:21:33,428 --> 01:21:38,678
I will not be treated the same way as
this lying, murdering, two-time loser!

1271
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,151
Silence, Mr. Glenn.

1272
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:45,156
Mr. Stamphill, you are perilously close
to contempt of this court.

1273
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,955
You will proceed with caution.
Is that understood?

1274
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,512
Temper, temper.

1275
01:21:55,192 --> 01:21:57,277
Well, would you care to withdraw
any testimony?

1276
01:21:57,433 --> 01:22:01,122
You wouldn't want somebody to come along
and testify to the contrary, would you?

1277
01:22:01,434 --> 01:22:06,477
No. I would not withdraw any testimony,
no matter what Henri Young has told you.

1278
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:10,160
I'm not talking about Henri Young.
Who would believe him?

1279
01:22:11,036 --> 01:22:13,676
Mr. Simpson, did you ever
beat this man, Henri Young?

1280
01:22:13,836 --> 01:22:15,800
Objection, Your Honor.
This has no bearing.

1281
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:19,242
No bearing? Your Honor, beatings have
a bearing on a man's state of mind.

1282
01:22:19,397 --> 01:22:21,285
Three years of darkness has a bearing.

1283
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,358
Do we need to be psychologists
to know that?

1284
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:25,559
You know that, Your Honor.
I know you do.

1285
01:22:25,718 --> 01:22:28,403
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1286
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:29,563
Mr. Simpson...

1287
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:31,881
...did you ever beat Henri Young
with a blackjack?

1288
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,044
Yes.

1289
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,884
Did you ever throw Henri Young
down a steel?ight of stairs?

1290
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:38,082
- I did.
- You were ordered to do this?

1291
01:22:38,241 --> 01:22:40,282
- Yes.
- Tell us the name of the man...

1292
01:22:40,442 --> 01:22:43,126
...who was your superior,
who ordered you to do these things.

1293
01:22:43,282 --> 01:22:44,690
- Mr. Glenn.
- Mr. Glenn.

1294
01:22:44,842 --> 01:22:47,963
- You never went to Warden Humson?
- No, sir.

1295
01:22:48,123 --> 01:22:51,244
Thank you very much. I won't ask
where you got your bruises. I know.

1296
01:22:51,404 --> 01:22:52,528
Your witness.

1297
01:22:52,683 --> 01:22:55,248
The prosecution would like to mark
for identification...

1298
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:58,012
...the employment records
of Mr. Derek Simpson.

1299
01:22:58,164 --> 01:23:03,010
Do you recall, Mr. Simpson,
being suspended on November 4th, 1936...

1300
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:06,407
...and again on July 6th, 1937?

1301
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:08,607
- Yeah.
- Speak up, Mr. Simpson.

1302
01:23:09,487 --> 01:23:10,611
Yes.

1303
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:15,612
Is it not a fact you were fired from your job
as a guard because you are a drunk?

1304
01:23:15,768 --> 01:23:17,492
- Objection.
- That's not true.

1305
01:23:17,648 --> 01:23:18,772
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1306
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:21,930
And that Mr. Glenn would not tolerate this
in a federal prison.

1307
01:23:22,089 --> 01:23:24,610
Isn't it true, Mr. Simpson,
having cost you your job...

1308
01:23:24,769 --> 01:23:27,574
...you would say just about anything
to get even with Mr. Glenn?

1309
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:29,811
The jury will disregard.

1310
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:32,371
...Mr. Simpson's testimony.

1311
01:23:32,931 --> 01:23:37,013
Good afternoon. Mr. Stamphill,
Mr. Stamphill, is everything all right?

1312
01:23:46,973 --> 01:23:48,861
You son of a bitch.
- What happened?

1313
01:23:49,014 --> 01:23:50,859
You know what happened. You set me up.

1314
01:23:51,014 --> 01:23:54,016
- What are you talking about?
- You took Simpson's picture.

1315
01:23:54,175 --> 01:23:56,980
They never would have known to tear
Simpson down if you hadn't told them.

1316
01:23:57,135 --> 01:23:59,220
Are you gonna hit me now, James?

1317
01:23:59,376 --> 01:24:00,620
Go ahead.

1318
01:24:00,776 --> 01:24:03,898
It's about time you grew up
and were a man.

1319
01:24:08,257 --> 01:24:09,262
You're my brother.

1320
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:14,462
- You had me beaten up.
- James, that was not supposed to happen.

1321
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:17,020
Only Simpson. You walked in,
it was bad timing.

1322
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:19,143
Bad timing?

1323
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,028
I'm putting Humson on the stand.

1324
01:24:23,181 --> 01:24:26,106
Why, James?
Humson doesn't know anything!

1325
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:30,703
Man runs three prisons. He has to know
something. Unless he's never there.

1326
01:24:35,063 --> 01:24:37,027
Son of a bitch.

1327
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:43,472
He was never there. Never there.

1328
01:24:43,624 --> 01:24:45,032
You never saw him?

1329
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,993
No. You'd hear about
him visiting, but I never saw him.

1330
01:24:50,026 --> 01:24:52,666
Now, your own brother did that to you?
Your brother did that to you?

1331
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:55,707
Yeah.
- Jesus, rich people are weird.

1332
01:24:55,866 --> 01:24:57,350
Hey, he)'-

1333
01:24:57,507 --> 01:25:01,708
You hear DiMaggio broke Keeler's record?
Forty-five straight games.

1334
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:03,712
Wouldn't it be great if he never stopped?

1335
01:25:03,868 --> 01:25:07,109
Dock records show when he was here.
Every trip to Alcatraz is recorded.

1336
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,310
- I had to sign in that time I went.
- Hey, Jim.

1337
01:25:09,469 --> 01:25:11,117
- What?
- We friends, huh?

1338
01:25:11,269 --> 01:25:12,394
Yeah, sure.

1339
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,911
Is it over? I mean, you know? Is that all?

1340
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,919
Nothing more you're gonna do
with the trial, I mean?

1341
01:25:19,071 --> 01:25:21,832
- Thought you didn't care.
- No, I don't care. I don't care.

1342
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:25,713
It's just, you know, long as you got shit
to throw at them, we can keep talking.

1343
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:27,596
But when it's over, it's over, huh?

1344
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:30,634
I'm not here to keep you entertained
until the executioner comes.

1345
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,561
- This trial isn't just a game.
- Hey, Jim.

1346
01:25:32,714 --> 01:25:34,078
What?

1347
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:41,439
If I was on the outside- I mean, you know,
if there was, like, a good fairy...

1348
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:44,956
...and she waved a wand
and I was on the outside...

1349
01:25:45,116 --> 01:25:47,636
...you and me, would we be friends then?

1350
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:51,486
- Yes.
- No, no, no, we wouldn't.

1351
01:25:51,637 --> 01:25:54,803
You wouldn't have nothing to do with me.
You know it.

1352
01:25:54,957 --> 01:25:57,926
What I can't figure out is why, you know.

1353
01:25:58,078 --> 01:26:02,127
I mean, we both ain't got nobody else
and we're the same age, sort of.

1354
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:05,204
And if I'd have lived in your house...

1355
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,125
...and they'd have switched us
when we was babies...

1356
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,768
...I could have been just like you.

1357
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:13,602
If they stuck you down in the hole...

1358
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:17,926
...you could be sitting here just like me...

1359
01:26:18,082 --> 01:26:22,644
...asking how come we couldn't be friends
on the outside. You ever steal 5 bucks?

1360
01:26:25,963 --> 01:26:31,485
Once, when I was a kid,
from my brother's wallet.

1361
01:26:32,964 --> 01:26:34,492
What happened?

1362
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:39,366
He told me not to do it again.

1363
01:26:41,486 --> 01:26:44,771
Why'd they put me in that hole
for three years?

1364
01:26:45,727 --> 01:26:48,335
I could have been just like you.

1365
01:26:50,488 --> 01:26:53,009
I'd just like to ask them, you know.

1366
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:08,539
Raise your right hand.

1367
01:27:09,492 --> 01:27:13,137
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1368
01:27:13,292 --> 01:27:14,580
So help me God.

1369
01:27:14,973 --> 01:27:16,817
You may be seated.

1370
01:27:21,373 --> 01:27:25,379
Warden Humson, in a book you wrote,
you refer to the convicts as your children.

1371
01:27:25,695 --> 01:27:29,536
That you liken your job to that of a parent,
providing for their physical needs...

1372
01:27:29,696 --> 01:27:31,463
...and molding their character.

1373
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:33,820
Mm-hm. Yes, I wrote that.

1374
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:38,823
I have a record of a prisoner named Johnson
who did 500 days in the lower cells.

1375
01:27:38,977 --> 01:27:41,061
The hole, the dungeon.

1376
01:27:41,218 --> 01:27:45,780
This was a 10-year period for such offenses
as not finishing all the food on his plate...

1377
01:27:45,938 --> 01:27:49,583
...having an extra pair of socks
in his cell, keeping an untidy cell.

1378
01:27:50,179 --> 01:27:54,185
Um, smuggling food from the dining room,
crumbs, in fact, to a pet lizard.

1379
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,905
Is this what you mean
when you say "molding character"?

1380
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,182
No, no, no. You're twisting things here.

1381
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:05,143
The isolation cells were simply a tool
of a temporary nature...

1382
01:28:05,302 --> 01:28:09,547
...for extreme cases
within the general population.

1383
01:28:09,703 --> 01:28:14,308
Moreover, you make it sound like
the prisoner did 1500 days at one stretch...

1384
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:16,111
...for one infraction.

1385
01:28:16,264 --> 01:28:18,468
That's not true.

1386
01:28:18,624 --> 01:28:24,267
No. Prisoners were held
for 19 days at a time.

1387
01:28:24,426 --> 01:28:25,954
- That's all.
- That's all.

1388
01:28:27,106 --> 01:28:30,991
Perhaps you can tell me why Henri Young
did over 1000 days in the dungeon?

1389
01:28:31,147 --> 01:28:33,755
Not 19 days, but 1000 days...

1390
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:37,269
...in total darkness with only 30 minutes
of daylight a year.

1391
01:28:37,428 --> 01:28:39,229
Yes. But he tried to escape.

1392
01:28:39,389 --> 01:28:43,634
You can't compare his offense with that of
a man who smuggled food to a lizard.

1393
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:46,834
Now, this was the first time a
sentence of three years had been imposed?

1394
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,114
It wasn't a sentence.

1395
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:51,195
It was an administrative decision
to place him there, uh...

1396
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:54,112
...for an undetermined amount of time.

1397
01:28:54,271 --> 01:28:57,916
Why not a time limit? Doesn't that seem
a little bit inhumane? No time limit.

1398
01:28:58,071 --> 01:28:59,959
Put simply, no.

1399
01:29:00,952 --> 01:29:04,434
While we strive to prevent crime...

1400
01:29:04,593 --> 01:29:07,562
...what shall we do with the man
who has committed it, hm?

1401
01:29:07,714 --> 01:29:10,715
We aim to make him his better self.

1402
01:29:10,874 --> 01:29:12,282
His better self.

1403
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:15,877
Well, I'm sure that Henri Young thanks you
for his better self.

1404
01:29:16,036 --> 01:29:19,965
It's a fact you simply put Henri Young
in that dungeon and forgot all about him.

1405
01:29:20,436 --> 01:29:21,724
Washed your hands of him.

1406
01:29:21,876 --> 01:29:25,282
Henri wanted me to ask you why.
Why would you do that, sir? Why?

1407
01:29:25,437 --> 01:29:28,002
- Objection, Your Honor.
- That's not true.

1408
01:29:28,157 --> 01:29:30,722
I withdraw the question.
I apologize to the jury-

1409
01:29:30,878 --> 01:29:33,802
It's not necessary that you apologize.

1410
01:29:33,959 --> 01:29:36,928
Actually, Your Honor, it is.
You see, I made a mistake.

1411
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:40,168
Warden Humson couldn't simply
have washed his hands of Henri Young.

1412
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:41,324
He couldn't have.

1413
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,121
Because he had absolutely no idea
he was there.

1414
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:46,290
Isn't that true, warden?
You are never there.

1415
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:49,246
And you permit Glenn to run that prison
any way he sees fit.

1416
01:29:49,401 --> 01:29:53,003
I am there as much as I need to be.
I run three penal institutions.

1417
01:29:53,402 --> 01:29:57,287
It's impossible to know every detail
of every inmate.

1418
01:29:57,443 --> 01:29:59,244
I have the port authority records...

1419
01:29:59,403 --> 01:30:02,208
...which you signed
every time you went to Alcatraz.

1420
01:30:02,364 --> 01:30:06,370
You went seven times in '38,
five in '39, 10 in '40...

1421
01:30:06,524 --> 01:30:10,409
...and only twice so far this year. Twenty-four
day trips in three and a half years...

1422
01:30:10,566 --> 01:30:13,894
...while Henri Young was in that dungeon
over 1000 days.

1423
01:30:14,047 --> 01:30:16,328
Twenty-four out of 1000 days.

1424
01:30:16,487 --> 01:30:18,528
That's as much as you needed
to be there?

1425
01:30:18,687 --> 01:30:21,569
You knew nothing about a man
who was left to die in a dungeon...

1426
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:24,173
...for three and a half years, did you?
Absolutely nothing.

1427
01:30:24,328 --> 01:30:28,138
In fact, you have never even met
Henri Young, have you?

1428
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:32,131
Right now, in fact, is the first time
you have ever seen this man. Look at him.

1429
01:30:32,609 --> 01:30:34,934
That's him there. That's Henri Young.
Right there.

1430
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:36,890
- He tried to escape.
- He tried to escape.

1431
01:30:37,051 --> 01:30:39,932
But the fact, the cold, brutal fact,
Warden Humson...

1432
01:30:40,091 --> 01:30:43,693
...is that this man, who had never,
never before in his entire life...

1433
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:46,733
...harmed or attempted to harm
another human being, never...

1434
01:30:46,892 --> 01:30:49,097
...was now a murderer.
That is a fact, is it not?

1435
01:30:49,253 --> 01:30:51,577
- Yes. No, he tried to escape.
- It is equally a fact-

1436
01:30:51,733 --> 01:30:54,298
You can't let them get away with this.

1437
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:56,615
If we let them get away with this,
where would we be?

1438
01:30:56,774 --> 01:31:00,736
- What? Should we let murderers roam free?
- Henri Young was not a murderer.

1439
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:04,016
Henri Young was not a murderer
until Alcatraz got a hold of him.

1440
01:31:04,175 --> 01:31:08,585
Now, the prison runs under your guidelines,
so you created the murderer, didn't you?

1441
01:31:08,737 --> 01:31:10,384
Didn't you?

1442
01:31:11,337 --> 01:31:14,546
He tried to escape.

1443
01:31:15,657 --> 01:31:18,626
That's the thing, you see.

1444
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:24,424
Mr. Stamphill...

1445
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:27,187
...do you have any further questions
for this witness?

1446
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:31,541
- No, Your Honor.
- The witness may step down.

1447
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,425
But he tried to escape.

1448
01:31:34,221 --> 01:31:36,350
I'd been trained all my life for that day.

1449
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:39,022
Control the witness, go for the kill.

1450
01:31:39,182 --> 01:31:41,703
Win, victory.

1451
01:31:41,862 --> 01:31:43,750
School prepared me well

1452
01:31:43,904 --> 01:31:46,424
My brother, he had prepared me well.

1453
01:31:46,703 --> 01:31:49,825
Years later, he and I would reconcile.

1454
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:52,553
Family's family, you know.

1455
01:31:53,505 --> 01:31:58,187
Mary congratulated me,
but we'd already begun to drift apart.

1456
01:31:59,026 --> 01:32:02,791
When you only try to win,
you sometimes lose sight of the goal...

1457
01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:04,914
...which should have always
remained Henri.

1458
01:32:16,429 --> 01:32:18,590
No way they're gonna
send you to the gas chamber.

1459
01:32:18,749 --> 01:32:20,953
Most is second-degree murder.
Maybe manslaughter.

1460
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:23,838
Ten years, if you get clemency,
and you'll walk.

1461
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,396
- You'll have your whole life in front of you.
- Monday morning...

1462
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:31,153
...I want you to get up to that judge
and tell him there's been a change of plan.

1463
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:34,433
I want you to get up there
and change my plea to guilty.

1464
01:32:35,352 --> 01:32:38,201
- That's a joke, right?
- Not to me, it's not.

1465
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:39,882
I'm not doing it.

1466
01:32:40,033 --> 01:32:43,678
What the hell have I been doing here?
Why have I been wasting my time?

1467
01:32:43,835 --> 01:32:46,039
I never thought we'd win.

1468
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:48,039
I thought you wanted to fight.

1469
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:51,197
I just wanted a friend.

1470
01:32:51,596 --> 01:32:55,044
- Henri, I am your friend.
- No, you're not. No, you're not.

1471
01:32:55,197 --> 01:32:57,281
It's always about you.
It's never about me.

1472
01:32:57,436 --> 01:32:59,237
You don't understand.

1473
01:32:59,397 --> 01:33:00,958
I already lost.

1474
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:05,440
You just keep talking and talking
and talking. And you never listen.

1475
01:33:05,598 --> 01:33:08,360
You certainly don't know
what you're talking about.

1476
01:33:08,519 --> 01:33:10,964
- You just don't know what it's like.
- What what's like?

1477
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,321
Alcatraz!

1478
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,845
Where do you think they're gonna send me
those 10 years you're talking about?

1479
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:19,042
They're gonna send me back to Alcatraz.

1480
01:33:19,201 --> 01:33:22,410
- Henri, when it's over, you'll be alive.
- I'm Henri.

1481
01:33:23,202 --> 01:33:26,084
I'm the one that's gotta do the time,
not you.

1482
01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:28,807
And I can't do it. I can't do it.

1483
01:33:28,963 --> 01:33:31,528
I can't, all right?

1484
01:33:32,203 --> 01:33:33,884
Listen, it's not worth it.

1485
01:33:34,404 --> 01:33:36,084
It's not worth it.

1486
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:38,368
Nothing's worth going back there.

1487
01:33:38,525 --> 01:33:39,769
Mm-mm.

1488
01:33:41,765 --> 01:33:43,729
Sixty-seven thousand fans...

1489
01:33:43,886 --> 01:33:45,773
...at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland...

1490
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:50,172
...watching to see if Joe DiMaggio can keep
his 56-game hitting streak alive.

1491
01:33:50,327 --> 01:33:54,453
Jim Bagby on the mound, works the count
to 1 and 1, runner on first base.

1492
01:33:54,608 --> 01:33:56,528
Here's the pitch. Joe DiMaggio swings.

1493
01:33:56,687 --> 01:33:59,012
It's a ground ball hit out to short
to Lou Boudreau.

1494
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:02,616
He?ips it to Ray Mack for one out.
The relay to Grimes at first...

1495
01:34:02,769 --> 01:34:04,930
...it's in time for a double play.

1496
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:08,178
Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak
is stopped.

1497
01:34:13,651 --> 01:34:16,259
Yeah?
- Mrs. Rosetta Dial?

1498
01:34:31,454 --> 01:34:32,895
Why are we in here, Jim?

1499
01:34:33,054 --> 01:34:36,340
Maybe there are some things
worth fighting for, Henri.

1500
01:34:42,656 --> 01:34:44,184
Henri?

1501
01:34:44,577 --> 01:34:46,421
Do I know you?

1502
01:34:47,577 --> 01:34:50,578
I'm- I'm Rosetta, Henri.

1503
01:34:52,258 --> 01:34:54,178
I'm your sister.

1504
01:34:57,459 --> 01:34:58,463
Um...

1505
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,145
My, uh...

1506
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,785
My baby's name is Henri.

1507
01:35:11,862 --> 01:35:13,422
You know, Mr. Stamphill says that-

1508
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:16,267
I was...

1509
01:35:16,983 --> 01:35:18,992
...beginning to think...

1510
01:35:20,984 --> 01:35:23,385
...that you wasn't real. That I...

1511
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:25,790
...made you up in my mind.

1512
01:35:29,065 --> 01:35:30,910
- I want you to come-
- Rosetta.

1513
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:36,235
I want you to tell Jim that I appreciate
him bringing you down here...

1514
01:35:36,387 --> 01:35:40,032
...and knowing that you turned out okay.

1515
01:35:40,187 --> 01:35:44,476
That means a lot. I want you to tell him,
come Monday morning...

1516
01:35:45,068 --> 01:35:48,833
...he's gonna plead me guilty
just like I said.

1517
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:55,995
I wish I wasn't so scared of them,
Rosetta.

1518
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:00,672
I wish to God I wasn't.

1519
01:36:17,634 --> 01:36:19,796
You take care of yourself now.

1520
01:38:17,977 --> 01:38:20,859
You may call your
next witness, Mr. Stamphill.

1521
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:22,937
Your Honor, be just a second.

1522
01:38:23,418 --> 01:38:24,422
I'm your friend.

1523
01:38:24,578 --> 01:38:27,023
On the outside,
I'd be lucky to consider you my friend.

1524
01:38:27,179 --> 01:38:28,980
Therefore, I'm not gonna kill you.

1525
01:38:29,139 --> 01:38:31,900
Are you going to call a witness
sometime today, counselor?

1526
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:33,664
Yes, Your Honor.

1527
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:37,268
If you wanna change your plea, you go up
there and do it. I'm not gonna do it.

1528
01:38:37,421 --> 01:38:39,582
- Plead me guilty.
- I don't think you are guilty.

1529
01:38:39,741 --> 01:38:41,389
- That doesn't matter.
- It does to me.

1530
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:44,390
Okay, counselor, I am very close
to finding you in contempt of-

1531
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:46,703
Your Honor, the defense calls
Mr. Henri Young.

1532
01:38:46,862 --> 01:38:48,106
No.

1533
01:38:48,263 --> 01:38:49,464
He just lost the case.

1534
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:51,543
You wanna change your plea,
you go up there.

1535
01:38:51,704 --> 01:38:54,269
I repeat, I'm not gonna do it for you.

1536
01:38:55,944 --> 01:38:59,426
Counselor, unless-
He's coming, Your Honor.

1537
01:39:00,505 --> 01:39:01,630
Go ahead, tell them.

1538
01:39:10,507 --> 01:39:12,428
Tell them, not me.

1539
01:39:16,508 --> 01:39:19,313
- You better ask me the right questions.
- I'll ask what I want.

1540
01:39:19,468 --> 01:39:21,116
- And I'll answer what I want.
- Fine.

1541
01:39:21,269 --> 01:39:22,316
Fine.

1542
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:29,835
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

1543
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:36,872
Stand up. Put your hand on the Bible.

1544
01:39:39,472 --> 01:39:43,313
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth...

1545
01:39:43,473 --> 01:39:45,360
- ... so help you God?
- So help me God.

1546
01:39:45,513 --> 01:39:48,438
- State your name for the records.
- Henri Young. Henri Young.

1547
01:39:48,594 --> 01:39:50,155
Be seated.

1548
01:39:50,435 --> 01:39:51,439
Your Honor-

1549
01:39:51,594 --> 01:39:53,439
Wanna wait until I've asked a question?

1550
01:39:53,595 --> 01:39:55,637
- I haven't asked yet.
- He's trying to trick me.

1551
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:59,277
Please instruct the witness to refrain
from speaking until I ask a question...

1552
01:39:59,436 --> 01:40:01,520
...and then just to answer
the question I ask.

1553
01:40:01,677 --> 01:40:04,122
- He's your witness, counselor.
- He won't listen to me.

1554
01:40:04,277 --> 01:40:07,039
- He trying to trick me. I just-
Silence, Mr. Young.

1555
01:40:07,838 --> 01:40:11,440
Now, here's the way it works.
Mr. Stamphill will ask you a question...

1556
01:40:11,598 --> 01:40:13,246
...and you may answer that question.

1557
01:40:13,398 --> 01:40:17,600
However, Mr. Stamphill cannot coerce you
into testifying against yourself.

1558
01:40:17,759 --> 01:40:19,364
Now, you do understand that?

1559
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,644
Yeah, I just want to-

1560
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,641
Did you and I have a conversation in which
you told me you wish to change your plea-?

1561
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:30,170
Mr. Stamphill, you will wait until
I have finished instructing the witness.

1562
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:32,646
That's okay.
That's the question I wanted him to ask.

1563
01:40:32,803 --> 01:40:34,931
It is not okay.

1564
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:39,688
And I do not need you to tell me
what is or is not okay.

1565
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:42,652
In this courtroom,
I am the one who decides...

1566
01:40:42,804 --> 01:40:45,686
...what is or is not okay.

1567
01:40:45,845 --> 01:40:47,450
Okay?

1568
01:40:47,645 --> 01:40:50,646
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Well, thank you very much.

1569
01:40:51,765 --> 01:40:54,330
Counselors, approach the bench.

1570
01:40:58,207 --> 01:41:00,695
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell is going on here?

1571
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:02,015
I'm just trying-

1572
01:41:02,168 --> 01:41:05,257
I mean, your own defendant
is looking to me to protect him from you.

1573
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,456
So, what's going on?

1574
01:41:06,608 --> 01:41:08,889
I know, Your Honor,
it seems very strange but-

1575
01:41:09,049 --> 01:41:12,618
As far as I'm concerned, you're an idiot
to put him on the stand for any reason.

1576
01:41:12,769 --> 01:41:15,170
Asking your own client
to testify against himself.

1577
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:19,260
It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense,
but the prosecution isn't objecting so-

1578
01:41:19,411 --> 01:41:21,016
No, I'm not. Let him continue.

1579
01:41:21,171 --> 01:41:22,459
Shut up.

1580
01:41:22,972 --> 01:41:24,980
- Stamphill-
- Enough damage has been done.

1581
01:41:25,132 --> 01:41:29,301
- I don't think I can mess things up any more.
- Yes, you can.

1582
01:41:29,493 --> 01:41:33,182
All right. All right.
But you're on a very short leash, Stamphill.

1583
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:34,981
A very short leash.

1584
01:41:35,134 --> 01:41:37,895
I will throw you in jail
for contempt myself.

1585
01:41:38,895 --> 01:41:42,497
Now, let's get this goddamn show
on the road.

1586
01:41:45,416 --> 01:41:48,657
Don't let him rattle you, James.
I think you're doing a great job.

1587
01:41:50,336 --> 01:41:52,104
Mr. Young, stop playing with that.

1588
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:59,903
Now, do you or do you not wish
to continue testifying, Mr. Young?

1589
01:42:00,059 --> 01:42:02,340
It's okay. He asked me the right question.

1590
01:42:03,139 --> 01:42:05,507
Counselor, you may proceed.

1591
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:11,702
Mr. Young, did you and I not have
a conversation last Friday...

1592
01:42:11,861 --> 01:42:14,786
...which you told me
you wished to change your plea to guilty?

1593
01:42:15,262 --> 01:42:17,947
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's...

1594
01:42:18,102 --> 01:42:20,830
I wanna change my plea.
That's what I told you.

1595
01:42:20,983 --> 01:42:24,344
I'm gonna ask you the single
most important question I can ask you.

1596
01:42:24,503 --> 01:42:26,303
It's what this whole trial is about.

1597
01:42:26,864 --> 01:42:29,068
Are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

1598
01:42:29,224 --> 01:42:31,986
I wanna change my plea to guilty.
That's what I said.

1599
01:42:32,145 --> 01:42:35,310
I didn't ask what you said you wanted to do.
I asked if you are guilty.

1600
01:42:35,465 --> 01:42:37,789
Objection, Your Honor.
He's badgering the witness.

1601
01:42:37,945 --> 01:42:40,586
- He's my witness, for chrissakes.
- I'm not your nothing.

1602
01:42:40,746 --> 01:42:43,868
If the accused wants to enter
a plea of guilty, I don't know why-

1603
01:42:44,027 --> 01:42:48,349
Silence. Mr. Stamphill,
you are skating on very thin ice here.

1604
01:42:48,787 --> 01:42:51,909
Maybe, Your Honor,
but I'd like to get to the other side.

1605
01:42:53,588 --> 01:42:57,430
Very well. You may proceed,
at your own peril.

1606
01:42:57,589 --> 01:42:58,594
Thank you.

1607
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:04,838
Let me take this one step at a time.

1608
01:43:05,551 --> 01:43:09,360
Mr. Young, we had a conversation
in which I told you...

1609
01:43:09,511 --> 01:43:12,797
...I felt with the way the trial was going,
the most you'd have to face...

1610
01:43:12,952 --> 01:43:16,313
...more than likely, would be
another 10 years. Maybe even less.

1611
01:43:16,472 --> 01:43:18,961
- You don't give a shit-
- Ten years, that's what I said.

1612
01:43:19,113 --> 01:43:20,161
Yeah, yeah, but-

1613
01:43:20,313 --> 01:43:22,878
And then did you say to me,
that you were Henri...

1614
01:43:23,035 --> 01:43:25,523
...you were the guy
who had to do the time, not me?

1615
01:43:25,674 --> 01:43:28,556
You were the one back in Alcatraz
to do those 10 years, right?

1616
01:43:28,715 --> 01:43:31,640
That's what I told you.
Why are you doing this to me?

1617
01:43:31,796 --> 01:43:35,485
Because, Mr. Young, if you change
your plea to guilty, they will execute you.

1618
01:43:35,637 --> 01:43:36,641
You will die.

1619
01:43:36,796 --> 01:43:37,877
So fucking what?

1620
01:43:38,037 --> 01:43:39,685
I'd rather die than go back there!

1621
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,008
- What did you say, Mr. Young?
- I said...

1622
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,965
I said I'd rather die than go back there.
Can't you understand that?

1623
01:44:00,482 --> 01:44:03,810
Why, Henri? Why do you want to die?

1624
01:44:04,081 --> 01:44:05,729
Because.

1625
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:08,611
Because I'm...

1626
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:12,130
I'm scared of them.

1627
01:44:12,404 --> 01:44:15,448
I'm scared to go back there. I'm scared.

1628
01:44:15,604 --> 01:44:17,372
I'm scared. I'm scared.

1629
01:44:17,524 --> 01:44:20,613
Objection. He's finished-
I haven't finished anything.

1630
01:44:21,206 --> 01:44:22,853
Henri, look at me.

1631
01:44:23,005 --> 01:44:25,450
Henri, look at me. Look at me.

1632
01:44:25,605 --> 01:44:29,054
You were right. You were right,
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

1633
01:44:29,206 --> 01:44:31,968
I'm just talking to you right now.
Not the judge or the jury.

1634
01:44:32,127 --> 01:44:34,015
If you wanna die, we'll back you up.

1635
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:36,209
I swear to God,
I will fight these bastards...

1636
01:44:36,368 --> 01:44:38,409
...so they will never do this
to anyone again.

1637
01:44:38,568 --> 01:44:40,610
You are not gonna die for nothing.

1638
01:44:40,769 --> 01:44:43,093
The choice is yours, Henri.

1639
01:44:43,369 --> 01:44:44,449
What do you wanna do?

1640
01:44:50,411 --> 01:44:53,173
I wanna stop being afraid.

1641
01:45:00,332 --> 01:45:02,100
All right.

1642
01:45:35,019 --> 01:45:36,786
Henri Young...

1643
01:45:38,739 --> 01:45:41,380
...are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

1644
01:46:01,864 --> 01:46:03,829
I was the weapon...

1645
01:46:04,664 --> 01:46:06,913
...but I ain't no killer.

1646
01:46:09,065 --> 01:46:11,106
They're the murderers.

1647
01:46:21,468 --> 01:46:24,709
Bailiff, you may remove the prisoner.

1648
01:46:25,628 --> 01:46:27,789
Escort the prisoner to the holding room.

1649
01:46:54,354 --> 01:46:55,914
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1650
01:46:56,075 --> 01:46:58,520
you have received your instructions.

1651
01:46:58,675 --> 01:47:02,320
You may find the defendant guilty
of involuntary manslaughter...

1652
01:47:02,475 --> 01:47:06,045
...which carries with it a maximum penalty
of three years...

1653
01:47:06,196 --> 01:47:08,641
...in which case the defendant
will be remanded...

1654
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:12,005
...to the custody of the warden
of Alcatraz.

1655
01:47:12,157 --> 01:47:16,926
Or you may find the defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree.

1656
01:47:17,078 --> 01:47:19,359
Without a recommendation for mercy...

1657
01:47:19,519 --> 01:47:23,688
...that verdict will carry with it
a sentence of death.

1658
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:12,369
This court is now in session.

1659
01:48:13,009 --> 01:48:16,611
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
how do you find?

1660
01:48:16,929 --> 01:48:18,894
The defendant will rise.

1661
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:21,770
We, the jury...

1662
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:23,535
...find the defendant, Henri Young...

1663
01:48:23,691 --> 01:48:26,092
...not guilty of murder
in the first-degree...

1664
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:27,856
...and guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

1665
01:48:29,131 --> 01:48:30,572
Order. Order.

1666
01:48:30,731 --> 01:48:31,736
Your Honor...

1667
01:48:31,892 --> 01:48:34,533
...we would like permission
to address the court, if possible.

1668
01:48:34,693 --> 01:48:35,981
Very well.

1669
01:48:36,133 --> 01:48:38,654
Your Honor,
we have this day signed a petition...

1670
01:48:38,814 --> 01:48:41,138
...which I would like to read to the court.

1671
01:48:41,454 --> 01:48:45,295
"We would like the following to be read
into the record of this proceeding.

1672
01:48:45,455 --> 01:48:49,056
Though we know it will have
no legal or binding effect...

1673
01:48:49,216 --> 01:48:52,140
...we'd hope that it will have
a moral effect.

1674
01:48:53,336 --> 01:48:56,305
We, the members of the jury,
recommend and request...

1675
01:48:56,457 --> 01:48:59,785
...an immediate investigation
by the proper federal authorities...

1676
01:48:59,938 --> 01:49:03,540
...of the federal penitentiary
known as Alcatraz.

1677
01:49:03,698 --> 01:49:07,824
We find this institution, its warden,
and associate warden...

1678
01:49:07,979 --> 01:49:09,704
...guilty of crimes against humanity. "

1679
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:14,580
Thank you. The jury is dismissed.

1680
01:49:14,741 --> 01:49:16,508
This trial is concluded.

1681
01:49:16,661 --> 01:49:19,542
All rise. The defendant
is remanded to the warden of Alcatraz.

1682
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:22,229
News from San Francisco.

1683
01:49:22,382 --> 01:49:23,986
The Young trial concludes.

1684
01:49:24,142 --> 01:49:26,587
The Rock will be investigated
as Young is vindicated...

1685
01:49:26,742 --> 01:49:29,787
...by a verdict
of involuntary manslaughter.

1686
01:49:29,943 --> 01:49:32,192
As I walked out of the courtroom that day...

1687
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,233
...I did not fully realize how much
Henri and I had actually accomplished.

1688
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,229
It all just happened so fast.

1689
01:49:38,384 --> 01:49:41,506
Henri, Henri, I'm gonna be up to see you
as often as I can.

1690
01:49:41,665 --> 01:49:44,514
And then you can bring
that Blanche back for a second shot, huh?

1691
01:49:44,665 --> 01:49:46,346
Yeah, I'll try. See what I can do.

1692
01:49:46,506 --> 01:49:47,707
No place like home.

1693
01:49:47,866 --> 01:49:49,951
Henri, it's not over.

1694
01:49:50,107 --> 01:49:53,108
It's not over. I'm gonna appeal
to have you moved to another prison.

1695
01:49:53,268 --> 01:49:56,356
I'm gonna file motions
to have your original case reopened.

1696
01:49:56,508 --> 01:49:59,029
Henri and Jim, together again, huh?

1697
01:49:59,189 --> 01:50:01,470
That's right.
Henri and Jim, together again.

1698
01:50:02,189 --> 01:50:04,830
- Henri and Jim, together again.
- Hey, Jim.

1699
01:50:04,989 --> 01:50:08,995
I won, didn't I?
I mean, I really did something.

1700
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:10,230
I won.

1701
01:50:10,951 --> 01:50:13,035
That's right, Henri, you won.

1702
01:50:13,431 --> 01:50:17,316
Hey, Jim, how many games
was DiMaggio's hitting streak?

1703
01:50:17,472 --> 01:50:18,912
- Fifty-four?
- No.

1704
01:50:19,073 --> 01:50:20,437
No, I got you.

1705
01:50:20,593 --> 01:50:21,881
It was 56, wasn't it?

1706
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:23,234
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

1707
01:50:26,233 --> 01:50:28,362
I'll see you soon, Henri.

1708
01:50:28,874 --> 01:50:30,762
Take care of yourself.

1709
01:50:47,077 --> 01:50:49,161
The definition of victory is:

1710
01:50:49,318 --> 01:50:52,123
"Success in any contest or struggle.

1711
01:50:52,959 --> 01:50:55,360
Engagement ending in triumph. "

1712
01:51:04,961 --> 01:51:08,409
That was to be the last time
I was to see Henri Young alive.

1713
01:51:09,201 --> 01:51:13,163
Before the court date was set for an appeal,
his body was found in a cell.

1714
01:51:13,923 --> 01:51:17,328
- He laid beneath a single word-

1715
01:51:18,243 --> 01:51:19,848
"Victory. "

1716
01:51:20,804 --> 01:51:23,849
Henri Young taught me
the meaning of the word.

1717
01:51:34,126 --> 01:51:37,651
He was the only man that I have known
who gave more than he asked.

1718
01:51:37,807 --> 01:51:40,492
All that he ever wanted was a friend.

1719
01:51:40,648 --> 01:51:44,532
And I will always remember him
as one of the best friends I have ever had.

1720
01:51:45,968 --> 01:51:51,730
Unlike many men that live much longer,
Henri Young did not die in vain.

1721
01:51:52,649 --> 01:51:55,138
In the end, he was not afraid.

1722
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:58,699
He lived and he died in triumph.

1723
01:52:00,651 --> 01:52:02,900
If only we could all do that.

1724
01:52:11,694 --> 01:52:13,178
Welcome home.

1725
01:52:14,734 --> 01:52:16,698
I've missed you, Henri.

1726
01:52:21,815 --> 01:52:23,420
Mr. Glenn...

1727
01:52:24,896 --> 01:52:28,901
...you can beat me,
you can put me back in that hole...

1728
01:52:29,057 --> 01:52:30,421
...whatever you wanna do...

1729
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:33,666
...it doesn't matter to me.

1730
01:52:35,057 --> 01:52:36,705
Action:

1731
01:52:37,138 --> 01:52:38,863
I won.

1732
01:52:39,458 --> 01:52:41,303
Reaction:

1733
01:52:41,499 --> 01:52:44,664
You can't ever take that away from me.

1734
01:52:58,662 --> 01:53:00,462
Take him to the hole.

1735
01:53:20,986 --> 01:53:25,112
Charles Dickens once said
that solitary confinement was inhumane.

1736
01:53:25,387 --> 01:53:28,508
Seven months later,
the Supreme Court agreed.

1737
01:53:28,667 --> 01:53:32,629
And as a result of the facts brought out
in the trial of The People v. Henri Young.

1738
01:53:32,788 --> 01:53:35,790
...the dungeons of Alcatraz
were closed forever.

1739
01:53:36,069 --> 01:53:39,834
Associate Warden Glenn was brought up
on charges of mistreatment.

1740
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:44,116
He was found guilty. He would never work
in the penal system again.

1741
01:53:44,551 --> 01:53:47,192
I remained in private practice.

1742
01:53:47,351 --> 01:53:49,600
I also became a baseball fan.

1743
01:53:50,992 --> 01:53:52,760
You did it, Henri.
