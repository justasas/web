1
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,464
<i>'Just you wait a little while,
the nasty man in black will come,</i>

2
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,947
<i>With this little chopper,
He'll chop you up,</i>

3
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:38,503
<i>You're dead.'</i>

4
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:32,004
Tell me what you feel.

5
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:37,805
Tell me what you feel!

6
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:45,706
Tell me...what you feel.

7
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:54,005


8
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:59,990
- Jade, wait up!
- Come on, hurry!

9
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:02,455
- I'm coming!
- He'll  be here any second!

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,724
Haven't you ever ditched before?

11
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,477
Not really.

12
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,139
Well, at least we had fun.

13
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,735
Yeah, I know.

14
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,237
Is your sister's boyfriend cool?

15
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:19,155
- He doesn't say much.
- Well, what's he like?

16
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,884
I don't know.  He's not
from around here though.

17
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,820
Ah, Shit!  He's here!

18
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,760
Cool car!

19
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,259
I know.

20
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:48,094
- So where are we taking you?
- It's just up this way.

21
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:00,047
Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,477
Bye, Megan.

23
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:11,487
So how was your first day
at school, Jade?

24
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,502
Fine.

25
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:15,556
Like your teacher?

26
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,661
I have more than one, you know?

27
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:22,258
So what's your favorite subject?

28
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,780
- History.
- History?

29
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:29,747
Very good!
You see, it's my favorite too.

30
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:37,416
Why do you like
to take pictures?

31
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:42,419
- Because pictures never lie.
- What does that mean?

32
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:47,519
The frame of a 35mm camera is alive.
It lasts for ever.

33
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,522
Unlike people.

34
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,671
Nothing lasts for ever.

35
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,612
What happens to you
when you die?

36
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,866
I don't know.
I guess you just rot away.

37
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,734
And you believe that?

38
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,903
Yeah, I guess....

39
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:07,859
Remind me to take your picture sometime.

40
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,746
Why?   You never take pictures of my sister.

41
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,139
Don't worry.
I will.

42
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,537
Hi Baby!

43
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,371
Hi!

44
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:25,193
Well, tell me all about it!

45
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:29,218
I will later.
-Now stop that!  Go back into that chair!

46
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,573
I haven't seen your sister
in three months.

47
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,965
She's getting to be
quite a big girl!

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,839
- Nah, she's still just a little squirt.
- I am not!

49
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,858
Seen any cute guys?

50
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:46,057
Well, listen to you
miss matchmaker over there!

51
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:48,716
A couple.  But they were
a little too old for you, Candy.

52
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,346
You little shit!

53
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,213
- Where's your ride?
- He's out parking his car.

54
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,714
You mean your ride,
don't you Charlotte?

55
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,238
You watch your mouth!

56
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,547
Charlotte's dating a German prince!

57
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,084
- Really?
- Yes, I kid you  not!

58
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,670
Don't be jealous!

59
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,400
- Hi, how are you?
- Great!

60
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,983
I was just talking
to Jade about her school.

61
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,006
You got to be more careful
little girl!

62
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,611
Was she complaining?

63
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,551
No,  not at all.

64
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:30,806
Well, maybe she can tell
us all about it over dinner.

65
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,818
Oh, not tonight. I have
to shoot some girls.

66
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:35,497
- Are theypretty?
- Of course they're pretty!

67
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:39,218
- As pretty as me?
- Never as pretty as you!

68
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,519
[Series of breaths interspersed
with ever louder screams]

69
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:43,153
What do you see in him?
He's a big klutz who carries
around a stupid camera.

70
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,483
Jade, stop it!

71
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:47,792
I can't believe you went out
and bought a pair of shoes just for him!

72
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,526
He's no fun, and he looks at me weird!

73
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:54,570
He's not weird just because
he's not from around here
and he has different ways.

74
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:58,895
You're always complaining that he's
never around and he never returns your calls.

75
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,940
Do you know how many guys
would love to go out with you?

76
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,249
Come on Jade,
I don't want to hear now this right now!

77
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:05,663
I don't like the way he talks to you.

78
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:07,510
Why do you love him,
he doesn't love you?

79
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:09,492
Then why did he give me
a key to his house?

80
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,265
It's probably a fake!

81
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,949
Listen, I just have a
really bad feeling about him, OK?

82
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:16,920
You and your feelings!
You know, you're not always right!

83
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,723
I am this time!
He thinks he's better than everybody else!
I mean...

84
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,501
look at the way he talks:

85
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:24,393
'Hi, I am from Germany,
and I wear tight pants...

86
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:29,533
and I think I am so cool because I take pictures of
naked girls with my stupid camera.'

87
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,781
What I am going to do with you, huh?

88
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:02,479
This wine is really good!

89
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,105
So Jade, how was school today?

90
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,637
There's no school on a Saturday.

91
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,538
Of course!

92
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,311
Forgive me!  I think hard and I work late.

93
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,047
It's all right!

94
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:34,346
Do you always eat
your meat that bloody?

95
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:39,295
Yes,  blood is good!

96
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,782
It's good for you.

97
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,556
Blood contains iron...

98
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:48,819
and you need iron to
replace your blood cells.

99
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:54,192
See, that's the problem with women.
Women have an iron deficiency.

100
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:55,193
[Laughs]

101
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,405
Among others things.

102
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,720
And, women need more iron than men.

103
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,083
It's ironic…

104
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:17,532
Women suck blood
out of men every day.

105
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,202
But at the end of every month…

106
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,664
…it leaks out!

107
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,837
It's just punishment.

108
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,191
So want some ice cream tonight?

109
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:42,894
That sounds great!

110
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,850
I have to use the bathroom first.

111
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,220
Where is my sister?

112
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:30,010
In the bathroom.

113
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,401
Where you're supposed to be.

114
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,468
Last time we talked about your school...

115
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,124
you said something about history.

116
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:47,111
Well, this is my history.

117
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,639
He was my grandfather.

118
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,309
He was a hero, you know.

119
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:09,472
He fought the bad guys
during the Second World War.

120
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:16,939
Yeah...    but…

121
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:19,573
Wasn't he German?

122
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:32,374
[Sound of engine accelerating]

123
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,075
[Sound of win and coins dropping]

124
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,115
Boy, aren't you the lucky one?

125
00:18:56,646 --> 00:19:01,123
- Tell me your name!
- Andrea, silly!

126
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:03,123
Of course!

127
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,379
-A nice big smile!
-OK.

128
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:17,888
Very good!

129
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:30,510
My...  You really are very beautiful.

130
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,798
Why, thank you!

131
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:50,502
Are you OK?

132
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,403
Excuse me...be right back.

133
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,210
OK.

134
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,615
OK...you promise that you won't say anything?

135
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:46,416
[Sounds of shutter clicking repeatedly]

136
00:21:51,424 --> 00:21:54,562
She told Candy that
he wouldn't even fuck her.

137
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,878
- That's weird!
- Yeah, I know!

138
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:05,048
- His grandfather was a Nazi.
- A Nazi?

139
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,976
A Nazi, like in
World War II.

140
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:13,476
Nazis, like Adolf Hitler and Germany
and that weird cross thing they had to wear.

141
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:14,826
How do you know that?

142
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:17,205
I saw a picture of him
plus, he told me.

143
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,057
And when I told Charlotte about it,
she said that I was just exaggerating.

144
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:23,241
So, what are you going to do about it?

145
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,645
He just freaks me out.
Charlotte's never going to listen to me.

146
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,783
It's just like that last asshole she went out with.

147
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:30,927
She'll always let guys walk all over her.

148
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,976
Well, your sister's smart,
she's going to jump in....

149
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:36,647
Well maybe, but...
I just don't see him going away.

150
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:42,448
[Car engine-varying pitch over time]

151
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:08,478
Take your clothes off!

[Car engine]

155
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:22,467
You're late!

156
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,771
As usual.

157
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:29,338
Man, this hemi has been
giving me fits.

158
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,953
But then, you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

159
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:42,701
Maybe I'll just find myself
a young girl and pimp her out...

160
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,090
then I could afford to buy such a car.

161
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,208
You don't have a daughter, do you?

162
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,044
I don't think so.

163
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,811
Can't everybody be as lucky as me.

164
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,247
Or as pretty.

165
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,804
Let's go in the house.

166
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,574
Have a seat.  I'll be a minute.

167
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,297
Let's go to the bedroom.

168
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:51,799
It's made in-house
in Germany.

169
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Germany will rise again!

170
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:02,910
500 dollars.
American.

171
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,119
I'll bet you that old girl in there
has already got her panites off.

172
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:27,818
For an extra $500. I'll walk
down to 7-11 and buy another 12 pack

173
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,938
And drink it there .

174
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,240
I gotta shoot some
girls.

175
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,287
I bet you do!
