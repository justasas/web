[solemn music]

5
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:53,234
WE ASKED PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO FILM THEIR LIVES AND ANSWER A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS

6
00:00:54,801 --> 00:01:00,001
WE RECEIVED 4500 HOURS OF VIDEO FROM 192 COUNTRIES

00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,533

[man howling]

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,033

11
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,167

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,133
woman: Can you--
man: Hello.

13
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,200
woman:
Can you speak English?

14
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,466
man: Yes.

15
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,701
woman: What--
man: [chuckles] Oh-ho.

16
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,266
woman: What day is it?
man: Yes.

17
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,000
I like to move it move it.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,167
woman: You know.
man: All right.

19
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:29,334
This is best day
of my life.

20
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:32,533
woman: No. I'm asking--
man: Oh, what day?

21
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,766
woman: Yes.
man: Uh, it's, uh...

22
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:40,667
Wait a minute.
[laughs]

23
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:45,067
A stupid question.
"What day is it?"

24
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:49,234
Ah. Sorry.
woman: Okay.

25
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:52,033
man: It's 24 July.

26
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,433
[laughs]

27
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:55,967
woman: And what a day it is.

28
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,667
man:
It's the best day ever.

29
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:08,667
woman: You might be wondering
why I'm up at this ungodly hour.

30
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,199
Like others, I believe
that the time

31
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,466
between 3:00 A.M.
and 4:00 A.M.

32
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:19,600
is one where the veil
between this world and the next

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,199
is the thinnest.

34
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,933
Often during this time
of the day,

35
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,700
I hear the sound
of my name uttered

36
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,233
by an unseen presence.

37
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:43,100

42
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,600
man: Whoa. [laughs]

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,434
[speaking native language]
That's nice.

44
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:58,867
man: And here we go
into the garage.

45
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,166
That's right.

46
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,600
We're going to ride
in the elevator.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
All right.
Let's ride it.

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,466
Here it is.

49
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,300
That's right.

50
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
This is the elevator
at the Market Parking Garage

51
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,534
in Roanoke, Virginia.

52
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,867
This elevator has been made
famous right here.

53
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:22,334
Here we go.

54
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:54,000
Here we are at six,
which is burned out.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,334
Just your basic
Dover elevator.

56
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,132
For all of those of you
at Dover Elevators,

57
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:00,266
a good brand of elevator.

58
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,266
Now we're gonna go back down
to one.

59
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,033
All right. Now it's time
to go off to work.

60
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,800
[engine turning]

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,099
Wasn't that fun?

62
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:47,000
Gray: You know how much strength
it takes to rebel?

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,334
Ha. So this is a night
in the life of S. Gray, man.

64
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,533
You know what I'm saying?

65
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:58,901
Sleeping on the coach...
with nobo--

66
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:02,667
Grinding my ass off
every day.

67
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,399
Shorties not enjoying
their mother.

68
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,199
Man not enjoying his wife
or his woman--his lady.

69
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,067
[baby wailing]

70
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,000
Just bullshit, man.

Alpha male trapped in
and locked in

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,166
through religion
and politics.

73
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,032
Soon enough, man,
my plans

74
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:32,067
will all come into perfection.

75
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,533

man speaking native language:
You need to have a pee.

88
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,100
Tai-Chan.

89
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,667
If you don't pee, you can't
watch TV, can you?

90
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,766
Hmm?

91
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:30,234
Hey. Here we go.

92
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:38,533
boy: Why do you have
lots of hair growing?

93
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,600
man speaking native language:
Because I'm a man.

94
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,133
boy speaking native language:
What about women?

95
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:50,100
man: Women don't have hair,
not as much.

96
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,868
[man speaking native language]

97
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,534
Say good morning to mummy.

Good morning.

99
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,867

Here's the incense.

100
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,600
boy speaking native language:
I don't want to.

101
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,734
man: Daddy will do it
alone then, Tai-Chan.

102
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,399
Tai-Chan, here,
sound the bell.

103
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,667
When daddy has put
the incense in,

104
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,667
you can sound the bell.

105
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,667
[bell rings]

106
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:27,801
Not yet.

107
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,701
When daddy has put
the incense in here.

[bell rings]

109
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,968
That's it.
Good morning, mummy.

Good, now put the incense out.

112
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,533
Good.

113
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,333
boy speaking native language:
All done.

114
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,466
I want some water.

118
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:56,968
man: Today we're gonna
videotape Sasha

119
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,132
doing his first ever shave.

120
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,334
Sasha: Oh, boy.

121
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,500
man: Sasha is how old now?

122
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,867
Sasha: Uh...15.
man: All right.

123
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,200
Sasha: 15.

124
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,467
man: The first thing
Sasha's doing

125
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:12,000
is getting the water hot
to put a hot cloth

126
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,067
on his face.

127
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,399
Sasha: Yes.

128
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,100
man: So that it'll warm up
your face

129
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,367
and moisturize your skin.

130
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,634
Does he have, like, a nice,
warm face now?

131
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,133
Sasha: It's always been hot.
man: All right. Yes.

132
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:30,466
Whatever
you say there, dude.

133
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:33,800
Actually, we should probably
do a close-up of your--

134
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,234
those whiskers.

135
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:39,501
They're really long now.

136
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,900
[chuckles]
Sasha: Thank you.

137
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,700
man: You need to, like, really
lather it up.

138
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,033
Sasha: Okay.

139
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,000
man: I don't think you need
to put it on your nose.

140
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,667
Sasha: Yeah. Yeah.
man: [laughs]

141
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,434
Sasha: Five-blade razor,
which we got as a sample.

142
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,199
Schwing!
Is it time?

143
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,033
man: Go ahead.

144
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:08,033
Sasha: Okay, you're shaving
for me.

145
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,000
This is embarrassing.

146
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,701
I'm bleeding.
man: Yes. Don't worry.

147
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:20,334
You will survive it.
Sasha: Wow.

148
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,166
man: Don't worry.
It will be all right.

149
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:26,901
Sasha: Oh, wow.

150
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,600
This is torture.

151
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,667
Ow!

152
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,133
man: Does it hurt?
Sasha: Yes.

153
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,200
man: It'll sting
for a little while.

154
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,533
There,
just dry yourself off.

155
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,466
And let's take a look
at the nice...

156
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,333
Sasha: Meh.
man: Nice clean shave.

157
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,233
Good job, buddy. Here.
Sasha: This is not clean.

158
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,367
man: Here's what we do.
Sasha: Agh.

159
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,533
man: Don't--give me--
face the camera here.

160
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,433
And we put a little piece
on there.

161
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:52,199
See? And it sticks
to the bloody part.

162
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,133
And voila, he's done.

163
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,466
Hey, wait.
High five, buddy.

164
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:00,067
You survived it.

165
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:38,868
[animal bells ring]

166
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:43,634
man: Guys, it's not good
to fall in love with girls

167
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,967
You have wives,
so you are all right.

168
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,600
Whereas I don't have a wife.

169
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,801
Bitch.

170
00:15:56,801 --> 00:16:00,600

man #2: The 24th.

171
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,167

No way.

172
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,600
man #2: Then what day
do you think it is?

173
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100
man: The 25th.
man #2: It's not the 25th.

174
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,901
man: It's the 25th.
man #2: 24th.

175
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,600

Oh, dear God.

man: We're documenting
everything.

179
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,366
Bobby: Wha-ah-ah!
man: Shh.

180
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,166
Bobby: Dah dah dah dah
nah nah nah nah!

181
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,567
Nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah!

182
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,733
man: Bobby,
let Mommy sleep.

183
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:10,399
[Bobby laughs]

184
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,267
man: Are you feeling okay?

185
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,100
Cathy: Yeah, I'm just
really tired, you know.

186
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,433
man: Okay.
Bobby: You feel weird?

187
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay, this is how
you'll be weirder.

188
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,067
Whoa, tch.

189
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,733
man: Okay,
let's let Mommy sleep.

190
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,800
Bobby: Okay, Mom.

191
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,399
Dah dah dah dah
dah dah dah dah!

192
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
man: Bobby, get down.
We're gonna let Mommy sleep.

193
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,968
Bobby: Son of a cuss.

194
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,234
Cathy: Thank you.
Thank you.

195
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,567
Um, I do have
a question, though,

196
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,733
'cause I--my biggest worry

197
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,233
is, you know, of course,
my bandages and stuff.

198
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,233
But I've been taking a sh--

199
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,867
I know I can take a shower,
but I haven't.

200
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:45,000
But I thought maybe I could
at least try to take a shower

201
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
before you got here.

202
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,834
Is that okay if I just go
ahead and do that?

203
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, good. Okay.

204
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
Bobby: Dad,
can I come down?

205
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Cathy: Bobby, can we have
a talk, though?

206
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,334
Please, please, please?
Bobby: Oh.

207
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:58,033
Cathy: I just need
to have a talk, okay?

208
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:00,567
Because Grandma
is telling me--

209
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,166
all the grandmas,
all the friends are saying

210
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,933
what a great boy you are.

211
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,366
And of course I know that.

212
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,166
And I know that it's hard.

213
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,399
I've never been in a hospital.

214
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
I've never been
like this before.

215
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,567
I just need us all
to help each other, okay?

216
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,400
And I know that sometimes
when we ask you

217
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,100
to do something to help,
sometimes it's 'cause

218
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,199
you don't want to go upstairs
'cause you get scared.

219
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,067
And that's fine.
I understand that.

220
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,567
Bobby: Dad's fault.

221
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,567
Cathy: If it's because
you're scared

222
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,733
to go upstairs by yourself
or downstairs by yourself,

223
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,199
just tell me that.

224
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,834
Bobby: I will. Sometimes...
[speaking indistinctly]

225
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,933
And stop videotaping!

226
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,299
Cathy: Bobby...

227
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,701
man: I was gonna give you
a camera too.

228
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,299
Cathy: We're gonna do
a project--

229
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,166
a family project, okay?

230
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,634
Can we all agree
to do the family project?

231
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,534
If not, then we can't do it.
man: Do you want a camera?

232
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:48,300
Cathy: Okay?
Bobby: What?

233
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,067
man: Do you want a camera
to videotape me?

234
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,433
Bobby: Mm-hmm.

235
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,067
Cathy: It's gonna be
a family project.

236
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,000
I need to have a happy boy
today, okay?

237
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,634
man: You have to be happy
if you have the video camera.

238
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,366
Bobby: Why?

239
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:02,233
man: Because it's
a happy film.

240
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,399
Cathy: All right?

241
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,567
man: And it has
a happy ending.

242
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,299
[sizzling]

243
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,399

was I a naughty child?

Truly?

246
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,234

Well, maybe a bit.

248
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:34,299

working for our family?

249
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,366
woman #2 speaking native
language: Over 25 years.

250
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:45,100

What are these offerings for?

251
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,466
woman #2:
To celebrate the full moon.

252
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:47,734

The full moon?

[woman #2

254
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:49,933

255
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,133
woman #2: Pelungsur cake

256
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:55,234
to indicate that
the ceremony has ended.

[rooster crows]

Which God is this for?

260
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:25,400
woman #2 speaking native
language: This is to Vishnu.

261
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,534
The water is an offering
for Him.

262
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:45,099
woman:
Okay, we're coming in...

263
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,366
Okay, first of all--

264
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,901
and I'm sure he hears me
by now--

265
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,667
let me explain something
to you.

266
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,766
Everyone, can you hear me
loud and clear?

267
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:56,000
My son was supposed to be
cleaning his room yesterday.

268
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Come on, boy!

269
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,867
boy: Woman!

270
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,299
woman: [chuckles]
Woman!

271
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,967
Oh, this is gonna be

woman: He's always a bundle
of joy when he wakes up.

274
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:16,167
Come on, come get in the shower,
get the day going.

275
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,666
We got things to do,
places to go.

276
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,701
boy: Yeah.

277
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,634

futures to make.

278
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:27,666
[lighthearted music]

279
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:52,299
man: I had
a major heart operation.

280
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,366
I'm very thankful
to the beautiful staff.

281
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:01,399
No job is too big
or--or too small.

282
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,667
And even down
to a few minutes ago,

283
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,967
just wiping my bum,

284
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:09,033
because I had my first--
first poop...

285
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:12,967
[chuckling]

286
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:15,067
in about a week or so.

287
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,867
So one of them came
to the rescue and said,

288
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:21,634
"Listen, would you like me
to trim that up for you, sir?"

289
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,233
So I said, "Yes."

290
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:31,032
And a very--very, um, courageous
young lady in my case,

291
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:34,333
I think,
did the job.

292
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:38,167
And just, uh,
all in a day's work.

[chiming faintly]

294
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:45,233
I'm very, very grateful
for these people

295
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,199
that have treated me like...

296
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:04,800
Just treated me so well.

297
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,500
In a short--short while...

298
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,299
I-I will be on the road
to recovery,

299
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,166
and I'll be out there again
doing crazy things

300
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:23,067
and enjoying life.

301
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:31,634

Amanda: I'm Amanda.

309
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:05,366
What makes me joyful
this Saturday is this...

310
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:09,701
And a little terrified
and really excited.

311
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:13,800

did you feel that?

312
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,133

Oh! Come over here!

What a little miracle you are!

323
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:43,000
Goodness.

324
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,467
Now your mama has made herself
a little copy of Mama.

I want to eat
the things I ought to.

00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:24,299
I just want to know

And clouds really
should be white at least,

336
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:52,334
and oceans should meet us
at the beach,

337

and I don't want
to overreach

[man speaking native language]

529
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,334
man: Did you see the fence
fell down in those thistles?

530
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,533
Goddamned thistles everywhere.

531
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:28,200
And you think I'm a prick.

532
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:32,433
[laughter]

533
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:42,100
man: This is how
brynza cheese is made.

534
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,099
When all liquid is removed,
the cheese becomes very good.

535
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:48,701
Nearly as good
as the Dutch cheese.

536
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,733
It even has holes,
in just two, three days.

537
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:55,199
woman speaking native language:
Oh, come on, stop boasting.

538
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:08,334

Lunch!

man: This is balut.

547
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,867
Only in the Philippines.

548
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,032
man #2: Balut.

549
00:43:10,032 --> 00:43:11,766
man: You see that?

550
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:12,933
woman: Ew.

551
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:14,501
man: Oh, gross, huh?

552
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:16,133
Look, let's put some salt
right there.

553
00:43:16,132 --> 00:43:19,233
That's salt.

554
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:22,567
And then watch this.

555
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,300
[laughter]

How does it work?

558
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:39,400
man #2: Well, it goes in
and out again, like a needle.

559
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,434
It doesn't fire bullets.

560
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,067
Nothing comes out of the gun.

561
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:46,199

Ah, I see.

562

[singing continues]

568
00:45:19,132 --> 00:45:20,733
Jack: Today is Saturday,

569
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:23,601
the 24th of July.

570
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:27,701
For the last three years,
I've been away from home

571
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:29,032
to do my degree.

572
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:30,933
And as soon
as that finished,

573
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:35,667
I ended up getting a job
at a very demanding company.

574
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:40,867
So I don't really get
to see my old man that much.

575
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:42,967
But whenever I do see him,

576
00:45:42,967 --> 00:45:44,533
we always go to the same place

577
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,334
and do the same thing
and have a catch-up.

578
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,533
man: I just phoned you.

579
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:52,000
Jack: Yeah, I just got it,
actually.

580
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,166
I was about
to phone you back.

581
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,467
man: How you doing?
All right?

582
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:56,300
Jack: Yeah, not bad.
man: Mouthful?

583
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,701
Jack: I'll have a mouthful.

584
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,199
man: You sort the tire out?
Jack: Um...

585
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:00,800
man: That tire's fucked.

586
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,601
Jack: I haven't had time.
man: That tire's fucked.

587
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:04,166
You'll get done for that.
Seen it?

588
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:07,199
You got a rip in it.

589
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,500
Jack: Is that a rip?

590
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:10,934
man: Why don't you film
down there, Jack?

591
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,100
Let's see if we see a cup.

592
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:14,534
Come on, that's it.
Jesus.

593
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:16,000
You're not a student now,
you know.

594
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,333
You're a working man.

595
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,600
There's no excuse.

596
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:21,300
Just here.

597
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,133

where we're going?

598
00:46:23,132 --> 00:46:24,733
Jack: Yeah.

599
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,967
man: Two small beef burgers,
believe it or not.

600
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:31,833
Imagine what the large ones
are like or the medium ones.

601
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,867
Ridiculous, isn't it?
Unbelievable.

602
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:36,733
Anyway, here you go, Jack.

603
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:38,701
This way.
I'm gonna sit in the car.

604

[seagulls crying]

605
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:06,333
What do you got?

606
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,701
Jack: This.
man: Oh.

607
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,967
Is this bit a photograph
of you at uni?

608
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:12,433
Jack: Yeah.
man: Fantastic.

609
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:16,166
That's fantastic.

610
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,634
I'm gonna get
a lovely frame on that,

611
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,867
'cause Nina's got a frame
like that.

612
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,199
[laughs]

613
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,233
That's really cool, Jack.
Thank you.

614
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:26,433
Now, you should be very proud
of yourself, Jack,

615
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:31,200
considering you almost
got chucked out of school.

616
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,900
You was lucky there,
weren't you?

617
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,666
Yeah, you've matured, actually--
actually, in the last year or so

618
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,500
quite good
into a real proper lad,

619
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:41,467
a real gentleman
and a nice boy.

620
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,534
[engine turning]

621
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,067
Thanks for that, Jack.

Who do you love a lot?

00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:24,334
boy speaking native language:
My dad...

624
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,733
because he brings me fruit.

625
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,867
He cooks my lunch,

626
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,833
makes me breakfast.

627
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:34,666
He prepares everything,
all the food we eat.

628
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:39,467
He cares more about me
than his work.

629
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:53,601
The thing I love the most
is my laptop.

630
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:59,133
In Wikipedia, there are
stories, history, math,

631
00:48:59,132 --> 00:49:00,600
science, religion.

632
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:02,032
It has everything.

633
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:05,099
It is a giant library.

634
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,199
[birds chirping]

635
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:12,567
man: I love being me.

636
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,132
I love life.

637
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:15,900
It's all such fun.

638
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,833
man speaking native language:
Myself, I'd have to say...

639
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,833
woman speaking native language:
Placing my feet in wet sand.

640
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,634
It has to be wet.

641
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:26,567
woman: Grass, dirt...

642
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:28,367
dirty river smell.

643
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:31,400
Mm, the smell of a campfire
that gets stuck in your hair.

644
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,467
man: Coated chicken
baked in the oven

645
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:35,000
with seasonings.

What do I love the most?

647
00:49:40,766 --> 00:49:43,800
Well...

648
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,967
you're looking at her.

650
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,032
man: I really love my family,

651
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:53,333
my brothers and sisters.

652
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:55,600
woman speaking native language:
Being with my children.

653
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,601
And taking care of them.

654
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:59,200
man speaking native language:
And now I'll introduce you

655
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,099
to the person I love
most in the world.

656
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,534
Hello.

657
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,166
girl speaking native language:
Hello.

658
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,666
man:
What do you love the most?

659
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,032
man: Women.

660
00:50:09,032 --> 00:50:10,666
So much.

661
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:19,266
man: I love you, Uliya.

662
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,867
You are my only love.

663
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,933
You are my first love.

664
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,767
For me, love is all about you.

665
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:28,867
woman speaking native language:
Do you love your husband?

666
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,000
woman #2:
Yes, you have to.

667
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,067
man: I love my wife.
I love my son.

668
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:37,601
I love my land.

669
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,867
I love my animals--

670
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:41,867
my dogs, my ferret,
my chickens, my horses

671
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:43,666
in the background.

672
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,166
I love my life.

673
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,032
But what do I love the most?

674
00:50:47,032 --> 00:50:49,266
I love my Lord,
my heavenly Father,

675
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:53,233
my Creator,
from whom all blessings flow.

676
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:56,366
man: I love doing
about 150 miles an hour

677
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,767
down a motorway
in a good car.

678
00:50:58,766 --> 00:50:59,900
man #2: [giggles]

679
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,199
man: I love football.

680
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,466
I think football
is the only sport

681
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,767
that bring people together.

682
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:07,000
woman speaking native language:
I love...

683
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,333
cleaning something that's really
dirty so you can see the result.

684
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,733
man: I actually love
my refrigerator.

685
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:15,701
It's such a cool thing.

686
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:17,967
It remains at one corner.

687
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,199
It keeps its mouth shut.

688
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:22,399
I love my refrigerator.

689
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,200
Nothing else
but my refrigerator.

690
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,833
man: What do you love?

691
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,967
man #2: Women.

692
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:29,466
man: What do you love?

693
00:51:29,467 --> 00:51:30,334
man #3: Freedom.

694
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,500
man: What do you love?

695
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:33,033
man #4: Power.
man: [laughs]

696
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,067
woman: I love the word
"mamihlapinatapai."

697
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:41,400
It's from the Yaghan language,

698
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,666
which is now a dead language.

699
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:47,534
But it was spoken
in Tierra del Fuego,

700
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:51,267
the very southernmost point
of South America.

701
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:54,067
I've never heard the word
said properly,

702
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:56,266
so I could be pronouncing
it wrong.

703
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:58,900
But the meaning
is quite beautiful.

704
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,666
It means that moment
or feeling

705
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:05,766
when two people both want
to initiate something,

706
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:08,567
but neither wants to be
the one to start it.

707
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:12,166
It can be
perhaps two tribal leaders

708
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,900
both wanting to make peace,

709
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,032
but neither wanting to be
the one to begin it.

710
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,534
Or it could be two people
at a party

711
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:20,233
wanting to approach each other

712
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:23,666
and neither quite brave enough
to make the first move.

713
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:24,933
[birds calling]

714
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:28,334
Can hear the kookaburras now.

715
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,567
[line ringing]

716
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:00,166
man: Currently,
I'm calling my mom

717
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:02,701
to ask her what I should say
to Emily today.

718
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:05,032
[line ringing]

719
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:06,366
woman: Hello?

720
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:08,033
man: Do you have a second
to talk to me?

721
00:53:08,032 --> 00:53:09,400
woman: Sure.

722
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,934
man: Tonight I am hanging out
with Emily.

723
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:12,334
woman: Okay.
man: But I was planning

724
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,199
on telling her
exactly how I feel about her.

725
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,466
And then I don't know.

726
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:18,133
So I was calling my mother
to see--

727
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:19,800
what should I say to this woman?

728
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,666
[woman laughing]

729
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,601
Okay.

730
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:39,400
I don't know.
I just think that, you know--

731
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,400
just concentrate
on the fact that, you know,

732
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,400
you have very, very high
feelings of esteem for her,

733
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,567
that she's somebody
that you've always admired.

734
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,701
man: "Esteem"?
Is that the word I should use?

735
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:52,132
Esteem?

736
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:53,933
You think she'd like that?

737
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:55,367
woman: Yeah. Whatever.

738
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:56,701
man: I just don't know
if that's--

739
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,199
woman: You hold her
in very high regard.

740
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,666
man: Ok--I don't know
if those--

741
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:01,366
woman: She's a special person
in your life.

742
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:03,701
man: Okay.
I'll try all that.

743
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,766
Hey.
I am on the train now.

744
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:18,701
This is my friend Emily.

745
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:27,701
[romantic music]

746
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,234
Uh, hello, "Life In A Day."

747
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:39,132
I'm still with Emily, and we're
still hanging out in Chicago.

748
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:41,500
Um, this is...

749
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:44,534
We--we just came out
of this place, which was cool.

750
00:54:44,534 --> 00:54:46,867
But, uh, I'm gonna
leave this thing on

751
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,766
in case anything
gets climactic.

752
00:54:52,266 --> 00:54:55,333
man: Theresa, look at me.

753
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,000
Theresa: [scoffs]

754
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,634
Oh, my God.

755
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:02,199
Oh, my God.

756
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:06,434
Aah!

757
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:12,033
[romantic music continues]

758
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:13,567
man: Well,
so here's the deal.

759
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:17,300
Uh, I asked her
if she wanted

760
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,734
to go on a romantic date
with me sometime,

761
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,132
and she says, "No."

762
00:55:21,132 --> 00:55:23,166
Just--just no.

763
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,900
That's really all she said.

764
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,333
Just "no."

765
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,399
She didn't want any of that.

766
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,133
Ever, possibly.
Never, ever.

767
00:55:30,132 --> 00:55:31,132
And so, uh...

768
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:32,567
Well, actually, I said,

769
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,634
"What about the possibility
of a possibility?"

770
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:36,400
And she said--
She said no to that.

771
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,434
No possibility.
None.

772
00:55:49,132 --> 00:55:52,867
woman: Okay, let me say
that it is meant

773
00:55:52,867 --> 00:55:54,800
for women to kneel down.

774
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,000
For example, a woman is supposed
to kneel down for a man.

775
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,367
man: Mm-hmm.

776
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,167
Do you want to show us
how you do it?

777
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,567
woman: Yes.

778
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:06,333
man: So you greet Moses, like,
traditionally.

779
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:11,501
[Moses speaking
native language]

780
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:18,567
man: Wow. Wow.

781
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:20,601
Moses,
how do you feel about it?

782
00:56:20,601 --> 00:56:23,567
She comes, and she kneels down
every day?

783
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:27,266
Moses:
Yes, because I'm a man.

784
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:29,833
She has to respect.

785
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,666
woman: It's the culture.

786
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:40,299
[upbeat music]

787
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:16,000
[cheers and applause]

788
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:44,300
man singing: Wise men say

789
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:50,901
only fools rush in.

790
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,366
But I can't help

791
00:57:56,367 --> 00:58:02,567
falling in love with you.

792
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:06,900
David: Hi, Grandma.
It's David. How are you?

793
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,933
I'm good. I'm still--
Yeah, I'm in New York.

794
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:15,300
It's--Yeah, it's been really
hot here, but I'm having fun.

795
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,167
Uh, anyway,
I wanted to call you,

796
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:22,833
because, uh, you know my friend,
uh, Nick, that I--

797
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,800
that you've met a lot...

798
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,132
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

799
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:29,032
He's a very nice boy.

800
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:32,166
Uh...
Well, I wanted to tell you

801
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:35,867
that he's, um, not--
not just my friend.

802
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:37,701
He's--he's my boyfriend.

803
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:42,701
Um, and it's something that I've
wanted to tell you for a while,

804
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:47,166
but I wasn't really sure
how you would react,

805
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:50,000
so I was a little nervous
to tell you.

806
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,766
Um...

807
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:55,533
I-I love you too.

808
00:58:55,534 --> 00:58:57,032
Yeah.

809
00:58:57,032 --> 00:58:58,233
I love you too.

810
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,967
And I'm hoping that--

811
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,466
that maybe
you can love Nick too,

812
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:06,300
um, because he's
really important to me,

813
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,367
so I'm hoping
he can be really--

814
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:12,868
really important to you too.

815
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:15,132
Yeah.

816
00:59:15,132 --> 00:59:17,933
Well, that--
that means a lot to me.

817
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:22,567
Yeah. Thank you.

818
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:25,166
I--Yeah, I love--

819
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,500
I love you too.

820
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,567
I do. Yeah.

821
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah, my parents know.
Yes.

822
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:37,534
Well, Grandma,
they call it being gay now.

823
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:40,099
You don't have
to say "homosexual."

824
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:42,132
It's not--Yeah.

825
00:59:42,132 --> 00:59:46,233
Yes, it's not a disease.
Thank you.

826
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:52,233
man: Here, throw some cheese
to those ducks.

827
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:54,701
Get closer to them.
I'm taking a video, Sarah.

828
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:56,032
Sarah: They might bite me.

829
00:59:56,032 --> 00:59:58,199
man: No, they won't bite.
Ducks don't bite.

830
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,900
Come on.
I'm making a video.

831
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,800
Walk on out into them.
It'll be a good video.

832
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,701
man #2: Would you like me
to take both of you?

833
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:05,701
man: Oh.

834
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:07,166
man #2:
Take another picture of you?

835
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:08,601
man: Thank you.

836
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:10,267
man #2: Just tell me
what do you want me to do.

837
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:11,600
man: Just...just...

838
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:14,367
man:
So marriage truth number one--

839
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:16,801
uh, love is a battlefield.

840
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,933
[laughter]

841
01:00:18,934 --> 01:00:24,033
Um, listen, you two are going
to fight like hooded roosters.

842
01:00:24,032 --> 01:00:26,000
Let's just get it out there.
It's science.

843
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,967
You know, place any two animals
in a contained area together,

844
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:33,132
um, you know, there will be
awesome tenderness,

845
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:35,500
but also there will be blood.

846
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:39,100
[laughter]

847
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:41,766
Tristam: That is my pocket
Walt Whitman.

848
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:44,567
He was surely one of the
greatest poets that ever lived,

849
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:47,266
and if my babies can read
Walt Whitman day and night

850
01:00:47,266 --> 01:00:50,132
and learn from him,
I'll be very happy.

851
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:53,567
After all, babies, he did say,

852
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,833
"I am August.

853
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:02,466
I do not trouble my soul
to vindicate itself."

854
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:06,133
No, he didn't say "soul."
He said, "I do not trouble..."

855
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:08,766
woman: That's enough, Tristam,
you'll use up all the memory.

856
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:11,067
This is self-indulgent, and--
Please stop.

857
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,601
They need winding.
Please stop, Tristam.

858
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:15,601
Tristam:
"I do not trouble my spirit..."

859
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:18,434
woman: Stop being so selfish
and putting yourself first.

860
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:20,234
Please, I've been looking
after them all day.

861
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:21,467
Just stop it.

862
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:23,133
Tristam:
"I do not trouble my soul to--

863
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:24,533
"I do not trouble my spirit

864
01:01:24,534 --> 01:01:28,133
to vindicate itself
or be understood."

865
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:31,000
woman: Okay, fine.

866
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,766
man: Ann and John
are today renewing their vows

867
01:01:33,766 --> 01:01:37,701
in the light of their 50 years
experience of marriage.

868
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:40,501
Rather unusually,
each of this special couple

869
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:43,100
has agreed to write
the vows of the other.

870
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,800
That is,
Ann has written John's vows,

871
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,500
and John has written Ann's.

872
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:51,534

Pull, pull.

01:01:51,534 --> 01:01:53,133

This one doesn't lift me up.

There is a new one over here.

man speaking native language:
Oh, gosh.

878
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:02,299
You have to pull on this one.

879

01:32:58,033 --> 01:33:02,501
and life in a day
and life in a day...

1230
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:06,434
I want to drink
from the clearest water.

1231
01:33:06,434 --> 01:33:10,300
I want to eat
the things I ought to.

1232
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:13,667
I just want to know

1233
01:33:13,667 --> 01:33:18,200
that I feel strong,
you know.

1234
01:33:18,199 --> 01:33:22,434
I want to reach
the greatest mountain.

1235
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:26,667
Climb, if I want,
without all the shouting.

1236
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:29,667
I just want to know

1237
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:34,133
that I feel strong,
you know.

1238
01:33:34,132 --> 01:33:38,099
And clouds really
should be white at least,

1239
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:42,100
and oceans
should meet us at the beach,

1240
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:46,133
and I don't want
to overreach

1241
01:33:46,132 --> 01:33:49,233
when I know what's in store...

1242
01:33:49,234 --> 01:33:55,367
[instrumental and chorus]

1243
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:26,733
[rhythmic dripping,
haunting melody continues]
