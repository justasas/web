164
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,190
a very rough working version without

165
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,170
effects cutting in and out and dialogue

166
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,310

175
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,779
probably thinking of the picture of what

00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,780
something for ya

177
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:47,129
exist

178
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:55,289
we're here now that's right home I love

<font color="#CCCCCC">you I love you too violent there's a</font>

180
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:59,789
love scene we call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a love scene it's</font>

181
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,930
actually a scene that leads to a kiss

182
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:08,338
which is the equivalent of a major love

183
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:10,679
sequence of another film and the music

184
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,019
is a very very important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it it's</font>

185
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,509
integral to the scene because they're

186
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:20,578
only about seven lines in entire

187
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:23,850
sequence and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> music is the dialogue</font>

188
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:27,028
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular scene it tells us</font>

189
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:31,409
what she's feeling because<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

190
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:33,899
two people are an open conflict but the

191
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:37,169
music says ah what you're seeing is

192
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:40,110
maybe conflict but that's a game because

193
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:43,740
actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're falling in love</font>

194
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,470
hey hey listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chewy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh joy</font>

195

there's nothing you can do although the

196
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,920
film is far from finished it's possible

197
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,778
<font color="#CCCCCC">to compare the effect of this sequence</font>

198
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,088

about a schizophrenic woman and and

British music and perhaps some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

256

affection comes through in that score

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the inertia starter off an old 1928</font>

biplane which we recorded near here

329
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:11,839
that's what that sound is and going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

330
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:13,970
to we also have the sound of a air jet

331
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,679
recorded in a dentist's office and an

332
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:22,009

immediately recorded that sound which is

time the music is reserved for

360
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:26,038
particular moments often to heighten an

and time all the film I'm alone all day

long composing capsid suits be

perhaps a more volatile kind of

play and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time I like to work</font>

396
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,640
at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love playing chamber music and</font>

397
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:37,529
then perform a few times in years much

398
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,610
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can with friends either locally or</font>

399
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:43,529
wherever I like making music with my

00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands you know it's very different than</font>

401
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:48,750
conducting where someone else is making

402
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:51,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sound and it's also a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font>

403
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,210
discipline and I think for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font>

404
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the aspects of performance have a</font>

405
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,279
lot to do with what one is writing you

406
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">can write better if you are a performer</font>

407
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,440
if you know really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a piece</font>

408
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,640
urban flow and really go and that's

409
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,380
something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it only can be</font>

410
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,990
discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> in performance the heat of</font>

411
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment it helps conducting I think a</font>

412
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,410
knowledge of chamber music is very

413
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,109
important for a conductor to also that's

414
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:19,160
that's the quintessential art of

415
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:19,159
ensemble

416
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:50,220
lovely one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems are</font>

417
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,590
composing for film<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the fact that it</font>

418
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a restriction and there is a is the</font>

419
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:55,859
inhibition of time there's the

420
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:58,109
inhibition of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of sound room</font>

421
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:59,879
that you've got we talked about sound

422
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:01,649
effects before and dialogue there's a

423
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,050
lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things have to coexist with</font>

424
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the music in a concert hall wasn't one</font>

425
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:08,369
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about John</font>

426
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,730
Williams has written music for four

427
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,168
films by Steven Spielberg at 33 one of

428
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,539
the most sought-after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Directors in</font>

429
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:17,969
Hollywood well the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I think</font>

430
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:22,378
about is that when I look at a film all

431
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:25,408
put together it's dead it's like lively

432
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:26,549
death that the film moves in its action

433
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,159
pace but there's sometimes nothing

434
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the eyes the movie and for me</font>

435
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,889
music has always brought out a kind of

436
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:37,230
spirit and the soul the movie is evident

437
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,329
once there is music to encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

438
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,300
along and I've always felt the music was

439
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:44,190
always a necessity for film ever since

440
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,929
the Great Train Robbery when the little

441
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,610
man in the orchestra pit on the tack

442
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:50,128
piano played to the images<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

443
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:52,710
picture the music wasn't integral part

444
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:56,219
of movies I think in the 1960s people

445
00:34:52,710 --> 00:35:00,240
got away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they began to equate</font>

446
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,909
realism with lack of a musical sound the

447
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:06,689
absence of music and those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the days</font>

448
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:08,429
of the social commentary when young

449
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,500
filmmakers were afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be too</font>

450
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:12,419
theatrical or too sentimental and I

451
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think now we've gotten back fortunately</font>

452
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,780
for you and for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for everybody</font>

453
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,240
else have gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to full blown</font>

454
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,780
symphonic orchestrations behind movies

455
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:25,649
and in many cases like jaws jaws worked

456
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:28,769
very very well as they film but he had

457
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:30,930
to see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without music to realize how</font>

458
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:32,460
effective it was with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> score that</font>

459
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:34,769
John wrote it was not the same movie

460
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,860
without the score well I think the music

461
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:38,570
is often the the unseen

462
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,760
we feel its presence through the through

463
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,590
the through sensing music the thing I

464
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">picked up on the film in Jaws the</font>

465
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:49,670
straightaway was the rhythmic aspect of

I can swim just can't walk for tres

Hades take it easy

476
00:37:52,489 --> 00:38:20,118
John Williams second film for Spielberg

477
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:23,480
was close encounters of the third kind

478
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,730
an intergalactic spaceship visits earth

479
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,039
and a team<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scientists tries to</font>

00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:31,039

troops and i found out that seven really

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,560
would produced a melody more than 55

between the mothership and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

Bank of lights and I tried every version

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,220
of mogh synthesizer and electronic

514
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:56,949

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tape edits and everything else to</font>

516
00:40:56,949 --> 00:41:01,779
get a sound<font color="#CCCCCC"> a noise for the mothership</font>

517
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:04,989
and a sound a noise for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the light board</font>

518
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:08,080
and we we eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried a tuba</font>

perhaps be double speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverberate it</font>

520
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,469
put through all kinds of kinds of sound

521

enhancement devices and and the thing

522
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:18,969
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tuba was that the player had</font>

523
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,320
to breathe he'd play a long phrase and

524
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">had to take a breath and there was</font>

525
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,880
effort behind it and and it seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

526
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,880
humanize the the mothership

527

00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:24,389
of composing and recording of the music

531
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:27,150
for financial reasons and reasons of a

that much time that's a composer really

535

needs to be to write with fluidity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

well consistently and film

time pressures were never more apparent

538
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,050
than on Superman where the shooting

539
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:05,449
schedules got longer and longer costs

540
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:09,950
spiraled but still the score had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

ready on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and good first thing we</font>

use an Orchestrator when the budget will

656
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,519
it's the thing that I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel in</font>

658
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,829

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,840
how slow is it or when is the point in

that's my first consideration

664
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:35,210
both thought

665
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,210
no all right yeah

666
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:43,848
okay that looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good measure to</font>
