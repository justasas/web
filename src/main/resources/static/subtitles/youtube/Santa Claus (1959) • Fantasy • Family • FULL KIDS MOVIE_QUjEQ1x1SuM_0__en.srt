470
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,380
remind us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Christ was born many</font>

471
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,710
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and he was even poorer than we</font>

472
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:11,858

473
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:14,588

477
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:49,779
while Santa steers his sleigh towards

478
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:55,239
Earth old devil pitch awaits his arrival

479
00:54:49,780 --> 00:55:08,710
here comes Santa now first stop Mexico

480
00:54:55,239 --> 00:55:13,479
City it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> freezing I was your back in</font>

481
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:23,679
Hades hitting the furnaces he's heard

00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:25,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">sample I said near he is I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glad that</font>

Christmas hey we will see your wins out

485
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:40,570
this is one night that no one can take

486
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:42,430
from me what's he going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh ho he's</font>

487
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:45,340
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push the chimney out of place</font>

488
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:48,059
so that poor old Santa won't be able to

489
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,059
enter this house

490
00:56:28,530 --> 00:57:17,880
let's hope Santa realizes what's

491
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:21,119
happened well what happened here I can

492
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">smell sulfur well that must explain this</font>

493
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,880
that ole devil pitch must be around<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

494
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:53,720
Santa's determined to get in he'll find

495
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:55,309
a way he's not one to give up well

496
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:57,679
there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one way to beat the</font>

497
00:57:55,309 --> 00:58:02,719
devil Santa<font color="#CCCCCC"> will jump down using his</font>

498
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:07,569
magic parasol old pitch hadn't counted

499
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,569
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's almost green with anger</font>

500
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:42,989
oh oh these two seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

501
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:45,919
Santa's in the living room look outside

502
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:45,919
and they'll see you

503
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:56,969
why of course Santa<font color="#E5E5E5"> can handle this all</font>

504
00:58:54,449 --> 00:59:00,889
he has to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is use the magic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dreaming</font>

505
00:58:56,969 --> 00:59:00,889
powders prepared by mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merlin</font>

506
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:06,609
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't long before our two little</font>

507
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:33,519
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> ablates are sleeping soundly in</font>

508
00:59:06,610 --> 01:00:23,289
their bed now what must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> pitched</font>

509
00:59:33,519 --> 01:00:26,199
putting the chimney back in place well

510
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:28,210
the devil doesn't give up either and he

511
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:31,169
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be quite happy about his next</font>

512
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,170
plot against Santa

513
01:00:42,929 --> 01:01:02,879
could Santa be coming down this chimney

514
01:00:56,818 --> 01:01:20,308
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh he's all right but that was close</font>

515
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:31,349
pitch is foiled again but suddenly

516
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:34,530
thinks of something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that's it</font>

517
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:36,450
he'll huff and puff until his burning

518
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:40,380
bread turns the doorknob and keyhole

519
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:44,029
red-hot so the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> he won't work and</font>

520
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,030
Santa will burn his hands

521
01:01:49,079 --> 01:02:01,259
first you'll see if it's hot enough what

522
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:03,389
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but Santa sees what</font>

523
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:33,360
bitches up to and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't afraid</font>

524
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:35,940
meanwhile pitch looks out the window to

525
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:52,800
watch Santa burn his hands doesn't seem

526
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know he's right behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ho a</font>

527
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,310
cannon now it's Santa's turn to get even

528
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">with pitch</font>

529
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,150
Oh

530
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:58,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">hiren truth is a poor little rich boy he</font>

531
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,869
has all the toys a little boy could wish

532
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:04,989
for him yet he is sad<font color="#CCCCCC"> and lonely lonely</font>

533
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:07,450
for his<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents in spite of all he has</font>

534
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:09,849
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacks the most important thing in</font>

535
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:12,149
life the company of his mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

536
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">father</font>

537
01:05:54,199 --> 01:06:39,980
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those toys don't make you</font>

538
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:42,230
happy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do something for you that</font>

539
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,108
I only do for children<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are very good</font>

540
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:48,559
I would let you see me as I am and

541
01:06:45,108 --> 01:06:52,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore i will use the powders that</font>

542
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,328
will make you dream that you're awake

543
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:06,259
and now awaken why you're dreaming

544
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:44,750
Santa claw you love me don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so you</font>

545
01:07:36,108 --> 01:07:49,250

546
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:50,750
just as much as your parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> because no</font>

547
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:53,989
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> loved the child as much as his</font>

548
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:57,230
parents only at times the parents don't

549
01:07:53,989 --> 01:08:00,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their children and the</font>

550
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:02,719
children don't understand their parents

551
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:06,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you really sure that they love me</font>

552
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:09,379
when I left all alone yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course they</font>

553
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:15,280
love you and you must believe they love

554
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:15,280
you and now go back to sleep again

555
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,810
it was all a sweet dream

556
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,650
when you awaken I wish you much

557
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:37,650
happiness

558
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:28,440
yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time since I've</font>

559
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:36,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen the markings they're both looking</font>

560
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:38,729
pretty well though aren't they that's a

561
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:41,009
strange cocktail isn't it's the cocktail

562
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:43,229
of remembrance which only I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare</font>

563
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:45,359
whoever drinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> its will think of that</font>

564
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:47,548
which is most dear and which at times

565
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,730
for some unknown reason we seem to

566
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:54,389
forget that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beautiful thought</font>

567
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:57,299
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a reminder very possibly</font>

568
01:09:54,389 --> 01:10:00,239
we forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> be someone we love love can be</font>

569
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:02,039
expressed in many ways but the truest

570
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,828
love is that which we give without

571
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,929
expecting anything in return the

572
01:10:04,828 --> 01:10:10,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">greatest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reward for those who love</font>

573
01:10:06,929 --> 01:10:12,300
sincerely is love itself so drink my

574
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:14,158
cocktail and you will become<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of</font>

575
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:16,560
that love which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> closest to your</font>

576
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:18,629
hearts in those without<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughs they</font>

577
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:23,730
couldn't drink this cocktail as it would

578
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:26,389
burn their throats well since we are

579
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:26,388
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much in love</font>

580
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,159
may it always be that way

581
01:10:33,488 --> 01:10:47,558
now that strange where'd he disappear to

582
01:10:43,179 --> 01:10:50,319
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was just a waiter he</font>

583
01:10:47,559 --> 01:10:53,679
didn't seem to be a stranger that kind

584
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:57,189
look the white beard I knew that face

585
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,658
when I was a child couldn't be if his

586
01:10:57,189 --> 01:11:04,238
beard was white when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were a small</font>

587
01:10:58,658 --> 01:11:07,179
girl he'd be dead and buried by now now

588
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:10,689
that's strange I suddenly have an urge

589
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:13,359
to see our little boy let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go home poor</font>

590
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:18,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">bellies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always alone I feel that he's</font>

591
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,089
needing us<font color="#CCCCCC"> too she'll be so glad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come on</font>

592
01:11:50,050 --> 01:12:00,340
pitch hasn't done too well by himself

593
01:11:57,908 --> 01:12:02,710
against Santa so he's back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seek the</font>

594
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:04,630
help of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these boys who so far are the</font>

595
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:07,510
only ones willing to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> his evil</font>

596
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:10,719
plans they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's smart to help</font>

597
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:12,369
him now but they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sorry for his</font>

598
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,739
advice can only get them into trouble

599
01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:16,808
one of us better get over there behind

600
01:12:14,738 --> 01:12:19,598
the water<font color="#CCCCCC"> tape</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and take the rubble on</font>
