Can you take me to the hotel?

00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,839
You should have a pass here
for Mr. Varakin.

15
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,240
No? That‘s not possible

16
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,959
I just ordered it.

17
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,680
There's no pass here for you.

18
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,759
Dammit.

19
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,079
This is Varakin. I'm at the
check-point but there's no pass.

20
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
I explained it all half an hour ago.

21
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,279
Varakin,
from the Moscow engineering works.

22
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
I've come to talk
about the air conditioners

23
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,279
you supply us with.

24
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,319
OK.

25
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,199
I'll wait.

26
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,439
What kind of lousy place is this?

27
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,560
Mr. Varakin, please go through.

28
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,879
Hello.

29
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,560
Ninochka! Order this right away.
I've settled it with the boss.

30
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,759
What's your business?

31
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,159
What's your business here?

32
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,199
I'm from the Moscow
engineering works.

33
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,039
It's about the air conditioners.

34
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,920
I'll tell him you're here.

35
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,880
The man from the Moscow
engineering works is here.

36
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,680
- Send him in.
- Go on in.

37
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,639
What can I do for you?

38
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,239
Well, what do you want?

39
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,279
I'm from

40
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,479
the Moscow engineering works.

41
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,160
Our director called you
about the air conditioners

42
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,360
you supply us with.

43
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,719
We supply you with air
conditioners?

44
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,720
Yes, for 15 years now.

45
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
Excellent. What else do you want?

46
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,639
We want you to change
the back panel.

47
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,199
What for?

48
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
Well, we're no longer 
financially subsidized 

49
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,079
Our technology's changed

50
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,639
and your panel doesn't fit.

51
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,680
We called you, sent schematics

52
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,399
and you asked us
to send someone down

53
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,600
to figure this out and so I came.

54
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,840
We'll get this sorted out.
Just let me find the chief engineer.

55
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
Nina!

56
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
Where's she gone to?

57
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,199
Excuse me,

58
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,279
your secretary--

59
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,719
She's sitting there stark naked.

60
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,399
- What?
- You know, undressed.

61
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,120
- How d'you mean?
- She's got no clothes on.

62
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,440
She's sitting and typing
like it was perfectly natural.

63
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh yeah?

64
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,759
The Party Executive Committee called.
They want you to call them back.

65
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,279
I've got someone here!

66
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,240
- So she's naked?
- See for yourself.

67
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Well, so she is.

68
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,440
So, where were we? Ah, yes, 
the chief engineer...

69
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,879
Put me through
to the chief engineer.

70
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,920
- We don't have one.
- What happened to him?

71
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,960
He died 8 months ago.

72
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
You don't say!

73
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,080
That's real bad luck!

74
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
What did he die of??

75
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,639
He drowned in the river.

76
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,639
This complicates
your business a bit.

77
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
Tell you what...

78
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,240
Come back

79
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,159
in two weeks.

80
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,120
I'll get together
with the chief engineer,

81
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,079
and we'll sort things out
in no time.

82
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,639
ENGINEERING WORKS

83
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,879
Yes, I did put a call through.

84
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,240
Natasha! I got all settled in.
Everything's OK.

85
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,320
No, I'm not ill, why?
There's nothing wrong with my voice.

86
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,199
I'm leaving today.

87
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
No, I haven't.
I don’t understand it myself.

88
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,840
It’s crazy.

89
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,679
I'll tell you when I get there.
It's very funny.

90
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,519
I'm leaving today. See you.

91
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,639
Dammit.

92
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,439
I'll order without the menu.
I'm in a hurry.

93
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,200
Whatever you have for starters,

94
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
And what kind of soup do you have? 
We’ve got solyanka today.

95
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,600
And I'll take some kind of meat,
not too fatty.

96
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,519
- A ground beef patty.
- OK.

97
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,480
Mineral water and tea.

98
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,120
- And for dessert?
- Nothing.

99
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,079
- Our cakes are fresh.
- No, thanks.

100
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
We're not taking orders,
this is our break.

101
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,120
Your tea and dessert.

102
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,080
I didn't order dessert.

103
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,240
Don't worry.

104
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,519
It's a present from the chef.

105
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
- What is it?
- Cake.

106
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,960
Bon appetit.

107
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,639
Our chef baked it specially for you.
He likes the look of you.

108
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,679
There he is is peeking out 
from the kitchen.

109
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,360
It happens sometimes, 
a person just takes

110
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
a liking to another person.

111
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,599
- Give me the check.
- At least taste it.

112
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,240
Bring me the check.

113
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,839
Just a little bit,
or else the chef will kill himself.

114
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,599
Stop talking nonsense!

115
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,559
So you weren't acquainted
with Nikolaev?

116
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,160
No.

117
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,640
You'd never met before?

118
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,519
Never. I've never been
in your town before.

119
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,720
I’ve got an evening train.
I just went in to eat.

120
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,759
That’s all there is to it.

121
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,680
The waiter did warn you

122
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,920
that Nikolaev

123
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,599
might kill himself
if you didn't try his cake?

124
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,320
Yes, but didn’t take it seriously.

125
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,560
It was all so crazy.

126
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,280
It's absurd.

127
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,279
His work-mates describe Nikolaev

128
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,319
as a restrained,
well-balanced personality

129
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,160
an active member
of the teetotalers' association.

130
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,199
If I'd known it would turn out like
this, I'd have eaten his lousy cake.

131
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
Well, OK. Sign here

132
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,960
and you can go.

133
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,600
I have read the above
and it is a true record of my words.

134
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,400
We'll call you if we need you.

135
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,039
One sleeper to Moscow.

136
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,519
Tickets are all gone.

137
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,319
- A seat then.
- There's nothing at all.

138
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,759
- Where's the station-master?
- He won't help you.

139
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,759
Where to?

140
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,119
The nearest railway station.

141
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,079
I can't go any further.

142
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,839
No entry.

143
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,079
- Want me to turn round?
- Is it far to the station?

144
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
A kilometre and a half.

145
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,920
Then I'll walk.

146
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,759
Thanks.

147
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,639
- Hello.
- Good evening.

148
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,880
Can you tell me where
the railway station is, please?

149
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,080
There isn't one.
This is our regional museum.

150
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,959
They told me there was 
a station near here.

151
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,759
Never has been.
This is a nature reserve.

152
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,759
Would you like
to see the museum?

153
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,799
- How can I get back to town?
- You can't.

154
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
No buses at this time.

155
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,200
Then how do get around?

156
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,400
I live here beside the museum.

157
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,799
Come to think of it,

158
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,439
not far from here lives a lady

159
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,079
who sometimes drives
into town in the evening.

160
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,879
I can find out
if she's going in today.

161
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,399
Yes, please.

162
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,200
Anna, it's me.

163
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,679
Are you going to town today?
I've got a nice young man here.

164
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,080
Would you take him along?

165
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,759
Thanks! It's all settled.

166
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,759
She'll pick you up in an hour.

167
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,719
Meantime, why not look round?
30 kopecks a ticket.

168
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,640
Where are we going?

169
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,319
The exhibit starts 28 meters
below ground level.

170
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,440
Did they dig the shaft
especially for the museum?

171
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,359
No. They used to mine coal
here in the last century.

172
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,079
They came across an ancient
burial site while they were digging.

173
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,439
The merchant Butov,
a great lover of archaeology,

174
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,279
bought up all the land
in the area to continue excavations.

175
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,640
That's how the museum
came to be founded.

176
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,759
This way, please...
Where’s the light?

177
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,559
The most ancient relics found
in our town

178
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,800
go back to the first fall of Troy.

179
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,799
This sarcophagus contains the remains
of the Trojan king Dardanus.

180
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Wait! How did the Trojans get here?

181
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,879
Professor Rottenberg has proved

182
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,799
that after Troy fell,

183
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,120
some of the Trojans went north

184
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,279
and founded
the first settlement here.

185
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,439
Here's an inscription.

186
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:01,599
'Dardanus, son of Hellen,
grandson of Priam'.

187
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,920
The same inscription is
on the shield found by Butov

188
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,240
beside the sarcophagus.

189
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,960
Let's go on.

190
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,039
The 2nd cohort of the 14th
double legion of Mars.

191
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,240
- Wait! Are these Romans?
- Correct.

192
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,759
Their disappearance without a trace

193
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,599
en route from Britain
to the Caucasus

194
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,680
was reported to Nero
by the legion's commander.

195
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,639
The cohort's re mains
were discovered by Butov

196
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,800
while they were digging
the second shaft.

197
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,519
Nonsense, the Romans were
never on Soviet territory.

198
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,719
The sculptural portraits
were created

199
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,199
using Professor Gerasimov's method.

200
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,600
Let's continue with the exhibits.

201
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,559
The bed of Atilla,
on which the leader of the Huns

202
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,599
violated the queen of
the West Goth in front of his horde.

203
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,920
Professor Rottenberg found
traces of semen on it,

204
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,119
from which he derived
a genetic fingerprint.

205
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
He fed the data into a computer

206
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,440
and he got an absolutely
accurate likeness of Attila.

207
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,799
Our town's
first rock'n roll dancers.

208
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,720
Smorodinov, Secretary of the town's
Young Communist League,

209
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,159
who had them expelled from the YCL.

210
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,119
The pistol with which Urusov
shot the False Dimitry II.

211
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,639
And here's the impostor's head.

212
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,079
How'd the head get here?

213
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,079
When the pretender Dimitry
was killed,

214
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,480
Marina Mniszek

215
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,200
had her husband's head embalmed.

216
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,600
Marina Mniszek's lover,
the Ataman Zarucki,

217
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,840
lost the head at cards
to the Uhlan Beletsky,

218
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,200
who was killed

219
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960
during the siege of the Kremlin,

220
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,519
and the head went to Fyodor Kuzmin,

221
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,720
a soldier from our town.

222
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,600
But he's not here. Let's go on.

223
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,039
Here you see
the Kievan Prince Vladimir

224
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,759
at the moment

225
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,840
of Russia's acceptance
of Christianity.

226
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,400
The famous revolutionary Petrov,
from our town,

227
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
a member of the 'Black Repartition'
group

228
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,720
who was betrayed
to the Tsarist secret police

229
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:57,519
by the head of the combatant
Socialist Revolutionaries,

230
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,159
the stool-pigeon Azef.

231
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,160
Azef's mistress, Lady N.,
an actress at the 'Cafe Chantant'.

232
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,360
The monk Julian,
ambassador and spy in Russia

233
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,159
for the Hungarian king Bela IV.

234
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Another representative
of our town, Burtsev,

235
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,519
superintendent of the hotel
'Florence' in Moscow.

236
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,360
In 1918 the anarchists
had a conference there.

237
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,319
This is Burtsev.

238
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,879
Here he is going in the door.

239
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,000
The Ataman Makhno himself
took part in the conference.

240
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,000
Here he is talking with the 
commander of the 

241
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,079
Jewish Army battery, 
Abraham Schneider.

242
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,720
Gavriusha, the commander
of the Black Hundreds,

243
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,199
who said he would hack down
his own mother and father

244
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,559
if Makhno ordered it.

245
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,880
Our town's first Stakhanovite
hero, Yegor Bykov.

246
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,240
This apartment belonged

247
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,199
to the railway worker Kuridze.

248
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,000
Joseph Stalin spent a night here
in November 1904

249
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,360
when he escaped from exile.

250
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,079
Next morning he proposed a toast:

251
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,159
'Soon comes the dawn,
soon the sun will rise,

252
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,639
This sun will shine for us'.

253
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,920
Zinovi Peshkov, Gorky's adopted son,

254
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,919
natural brother of Sverdlov,

255
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,680
Ambassador to China, in the 30's.

256
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,480
And who's this?

257
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,039
That is the president
of our writers' organization,

258
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,840
Chugunov.

259
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,359
On March 10, 1938

260
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,760
his first poem was printed:

261
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,960
'Sentence of the People.'

262
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,960
'Bayonets of the guard,
We're in the October Hall.

263
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,039
'The judge's bench,
the prosecutor's steely phrase:

264
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,280
'So, how much did you take
from the Germans,

265
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,279
'To betray your homeland yet again?

266
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:04,440
'The malice in their eyes
flickered and faded,

267
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,240
'The accused did not look
at the hall...

268
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,559
'Yes, we added glass into butter,

269
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,760
'Yes, I ordered
Gorky's assassination...

270
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:15,599
'I took money for spying
in the Reichswehr.

271
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,199
'Terror, sabotage,
betrayal, venom...

272
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,119
'They sit there like captive beasts,
reciting in turn:

273
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,119
'Chernov, Yagoda,
Rosengoltz, Bukharin.

274
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,360
'The human features
fade away

275
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,920
'And monstrous, devilish mugs

276
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,920
'You come to see
before you.'

277
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,240
In 1949 Chugunov

278
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,960
was accused of cosmopolitanism

279
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,720
for his novel
'Kuchelbecker's Fetters'.

280
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,039
In 1956 he was rehabilitated.

281
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
The first chairman
of our Revolutionary Committee,

282
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,559
Mikhail Zverev, who took part
in the liquidation

283
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,280
of the imperial family.

284
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,680
Here he is at a meeting
with construction workers

285
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,239
from the White Sea-Baltic Canal
and their supervisors.

286
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,360
He's the one with the accordion
on the left

287
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,320
of the camps' political
police chief, Berman.

288
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,880
At this meeting

289
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,720
the deputy head
of the OGPU Yagoda said:

290
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,159
'The OGPU labor camps

291
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,919
are pioneers

292
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,679
'in the cultural assimilation
of remote regions'.

293
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,159
Another native of our town,
Academician Fomin.

294
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,800
In 1934 he discussed
with Khrushchev and Kaganovich

295
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,039
a project to erect
a magnificent Commissariat

296
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,559
of the Heavy-Metal Industry
on Red Square.

297
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,639
Mayor Sokolov
was also born in our town.

298
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,159
While providing air-cover

299
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,079
to an Anglo-American convoy in 1942

300
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,360
he engaged ten German planes
in combat. He shot down six of them,

301
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,920
and though fatally wounded,

302
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,640
he landed his own fighter safely.

303
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Antonina Petukhova,
known as 'The monkey',

304
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,960
the first citizen of our town,

305
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,440
to be arrested in 1957
at the youth festival in Moscow

306
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,840
for interacting with foreigners.

307
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,039
'Dreams', a composition

308
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,160
by our sculptor, Troitsky.

309
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,880
Where's Anna?

310
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,240
She's usually very punctual.

311
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,039
Maybe she's changed her mind?

312
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,960
Well, you can sleep here.

313
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,080
Where?

314
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,680
Our electrician lives close by.

315
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,039
He has a large house.

316
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,279
Maybe I could leave right now?

317
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,399
You won't get anywhere now,

318
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,039
it's 15 kilometres to the road.

319
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,240
Come on, I'll arrange
a bed for the night.

320
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:06,800
Please help yourself.

321
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,840
How'd you end up in these parts?
You a tourist?

322
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,680
No.

323
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,400
Help yourself.

324
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,960
I asked the taxi driver
for the nearest railway station.

325
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,559
That's in Perebrodino

326
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,240
and this is Perebrodovo,
so the taxi-drivers get confused.

327
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,880
Was the taxi driver young?

328
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,239
- Yes.
- I see.

329
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,040
Oh, Lady of the House! I think 
the potatoes are probably burnt.

330
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,960
- How about a glass of vodka?
- No, thanks, I don't drink.

331
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,279
Homebrew!

332
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,640
You'll never leave our town.

333
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,000
What?

334
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,400
You'll never leave.

335
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,800
You'll die in 2015

336
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,320
and they'll bury you
in the town cemetery.

337
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,200
I can see the gravestone
with the words:

338
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,039
Alexei Varakin:

339
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,039
1945-2015.

340
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,280
To our beloved father

341
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,559
from his daughters Julia, Natasha,
Tamara, Zinaida.

342
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,920
Special brew.

343
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,079
What are you doing here?
Get off to bed!

344
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
Ten o'clock,
and he's still hanging around!

345
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,440
- Good night.
- Good night.

346
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,400
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

347
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,599
To our meeting here.

348
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,480
Excuse me,
but where can I lie down?

349
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,320
- You sleepy already?
- I'm sorry, I'm very tired.

350
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,879
But you haven't eaten anything yet.

351
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,239
Thanks, but I'm not hungry,
just very tired.

352
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:44,119
I'll show you the way.

353
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Here's a towel.
Make yourself comfortable.

354
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,079
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

355
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,360
When we bought the house,
Victor found it in the attic

356
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,559
and hung it up

357
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,680
- Good night.
- Good night.

358
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,200
Excuse me. Someone's come for you.

359
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,440
Hello, my name's Anna.
I couldn't get to the museum,

360
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,720
I had a flat tire.

361
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,480
I can take you
to town now if you like.

362
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,840
Could you take me to Perebrodino?

363
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:05,119
- To the railway station?
- I have to get to Moscow.

364
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,480
There are two Moscow trains
that stop at Perebrodino.

365
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:12,000
Great.

366
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,840
Are you upset about something?

367
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,279
Upset? Not really. More surprised.

368
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,920
Has anyone ever foretold
your future?

369
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,400
No.

370
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,000
But I have read
that in the 16th century

371
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,960
Nostradamus foretold
the rise of Hitler.

372
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,119
Someone's following us.

373
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:47,960
They want us to stop.

374
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,200
Mr. Varakin?

375
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:10,239
Please get into the car.

376
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,800
We've got new information,
we have to check something out.

377
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,399
Do you recognize this person?

378
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:30,759
- That's me.
- That's correct.

379
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,159
This photograph
was found among the papers

380
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:38,000
of the deceased chef Nikolaev.

381
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,000
How did he get it?

382
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,679
That's what we'd like to know.

383
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,960
You said you didn't know him.

384
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
I didn't.

385
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,119
Then how do you explain this?

386
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,639
'To my dear father from Makhmud'.

387
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,560
What?

388
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,319
It appears you're Makhmud,
the chef's son.

389
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,759
This is crazy. What son?

390
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,599
What Makhmud?

391
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:26,960
Expert examination indicates
that your signature

392
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,080
and the one on the photo

393
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,440
are identical.

394
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,679
There's some misunderstanding.

395
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,639
I never laid eyes
on that chef before.

396
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,639
My father is

397
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,280
Mikhail Alekseevich Varakin.

398
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,920
He's never been a chef,
he's an engineer.

399
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,240
How do we explain that a photo
with an inscription

400
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:07,079
in your writing was
in the possession of Nikolaev?

401
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,680
I don't know.

402
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,960
Perhaps you met the chef
some time or other?

403
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,519
I swear I never met him before.

404
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,960
I have to ask you not
to leave the area.

405
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,000
What? But it's all a mistake!

406
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,360
Don't worry, we'll sort it all out.

407
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,440
I have to get to Moscow.

408
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,720
You must sign a declaration that
you will not leave this town.

409
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:57,000
You can appeal to the public
prosecutor if you wish.

410
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,880
- Alexei Varakin?
- Yes.

411
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,320
This is the town prosecutor here.

412
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,720
Come down, please,
we have a car waiting for you.

413
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,440
Hello, Alexei.

414
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,639
I know what it is you wanted
to see me about.

415
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,480
A strange business.

416
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,720
It's a misunderstanding.

417
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,400
I've nothing at all to do with that 
business. I just happened to be there.

418
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,039
I have to get to Moscow. Urgently.

419
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,039
Alexei!

420
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,919
Were you never tempted
to commit a crime?

421
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:04,119
- What for?
- Just for...

422
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,960
...the sake of doing
something criminal.

423
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:13,799
You know, steal a stereo,
attack a policeman.

424
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,160
Why should I attack a policeman?

425
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:22,400
The policeman's just an example,
that's all.

426
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,360
Imagine,

427
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:27,960
I, the public prosecutor here,

428
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,559
dream of committing a crime.

429
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,799
I spend all my life
punishing criminals,

430
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,079
but in my heart I really envy them.

431
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:45,320
A paradox

432
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:48,079
worthy of the novelist's pen.

433
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,160
I'd love to do
something absolutely crazy,

434
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,559
that no one would ever expect of me.

435
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,159
But let's get back
to the business in hand.

436
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,400
You want me to allow you
to go back to Moscow?

437
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,240
Yes.

438
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,759
Don't you think
you might have been a witness,

439
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,000
not of a suicide, but of a murder?

440
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,519
- What?
- Yes, a murder.

441
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,640
But I saw him shoot himself.

442
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,519
That's just it, you didn't see that.

443
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,599
Remember how it happened.

444
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,400
Your tea and dessert.

445
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,519
I didn't order any dessert.

446
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,600
Don't worry.

447
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,880
It's a present from the chef.

448
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,559
- What is it?
- Cake.

449
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:31,839
Stop. Why the jazz?

450
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,039
I don't know.
Probably they were rehearsing.

451
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,639
There's never been
any jazz in that restaurant.

452
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,879
But they did play.

453
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:45,960
Maybe they were only pretending
to play, miming to a record?

454
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,240
But why?

455
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,160
So you wouldn't hear the shot,

456
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,360
from the kitchen.

457
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,720
The first shot in this tale.

458
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,600
I don't understand.

459
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,200
Even if someone killed Nikolaev,

460
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,320
why set up this whole farce?

461
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:55,679
I'm not saying someone did kill him,
but it's possible.

462
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:01,359
The whole business
looks absurd enough

463
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,640
to make you suspect
a premeditated murder.

464
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,199
But maybe that's
what they were counting on.

465
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:14,119
They had to convince you,
a bystander,

466
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,519
that you had witnessed a suicide.

467
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,519
And they did.

468
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:36,360
I have to get to Moscow.

469
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,800
You evidently fail to appreciate

470
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,960
the seriousness
of the Nikolaev case.

471
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,119
It affects the interests
of the State.

472
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:18,559
Since the times
of the Mongol invasion

473
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,760
the main idea uniting us,

474
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,839
which inspired generations
of our forebears,

475
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:28,199
is the idea of statehood.

476
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,200
A great and mighty state
is the ideal

477
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,039
for which the Russian
is willing to suffer,

478
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,760
to bear any deprivation.

479
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:41,399
Ready, if need be, to give his life.

480
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,880
This is an irrational idea,

481
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:48,559
not the pragmatic European striving

482
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,760
to extract the maximum
of personal profit.

483
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,800
It's the idea
of the great Russian spirit,

484
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,159
of which your own individuality,
and mine,

485
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,880
is only a small subordinate part,

486
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,199
but which repays us both
a hundred times over.

487
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,480
This feeling of belonging
to a great organism

488
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,079
inspires our spirits

489
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,520
with a feeling of strength
and immortality.

490
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:22,599
The West has always striven

491
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,239
to discredit our idea of statehood.

492
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,440
But the greatest danger lies
not in the West,

493
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:31,639
but in our own selves.

494
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,240
We grasp at all these incessant

495
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:37,199
at fashionable Western ideas,

496
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:40,800
seduced by their obvious
rationality and practicality,

497
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,720
not realizing
that just these qualities

498
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,159
give them a fatal power over us.

499
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,119
But never mind,
in the end our own idea

500
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,360
always comes out on top.

501
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:01,000
Our revolutions have all finally led

502
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,519
not to the destruction,
but to the strengthening,

503
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,000
the reinforcement of the State.

504
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:10,440
They always will.

505
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:18,879
But not many people realize
that the present moment

506
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,199
is one of the most critical
in our entire history.

507
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,159
And the case of chef Nikolaev,

508
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:33,679
which appears so trivial
at first glance,

509
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:37,839
has a profound significance.

510
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:42,759
So there's no way

511
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,760
you can leave town.

512
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,319
What do I have to do?

513
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,120
Nothing.

514
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:05,400
Just one request:

515
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,360
if anyone should ask,

516
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:12,199
don't deny that you are
the chef's son, Makhmud.

517
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:48,799
Varakin?
How'd you like a bit of fun?

518
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:50,960
What?

519
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:54,079
My friend and I
are just dying of boredom,

520
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,880
I thought you might like
a bit of fun.

521
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,760
Who are you?

522
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,079
We'll cook the dumplings,
you bring the wine.

523
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:06,440
Leave me alone!

524
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,279
Please yourself.

525
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:21,320
Who is it?

526
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,599
I’m here with a request…

527
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,079
The writer Chugunov
wants to see you.

528
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,120
What for?

529
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:49,759
It's very important for you,
let's go.

530
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,919
I'm not going anywhere.

531
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,600
Please come.

532
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:00,440
It's has to do
with your father Nikolaev.

533
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,760
- Alexei Mikhailovich?
- Yes.

534
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,079
Pleased to meet you. Chugunov.

535
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,240
Please come in.

536
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,640
You witnessed the suicide
of the chef Nikolaev.

537
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,960
The point is that Nikolaev

538
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,320
was our town's first rock'n roller.

539
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,639
It all happened
in the Zhdanov House of Culture

540
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,320
on the 18th of May 1957.

541
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:39,480
Look.

542
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:50,039
It was It was a typical party 
for youth.

543
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,640
You know, young people dancing

544
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,199
and enjoying themselves.

545
01:04:57,239 --> 01:04:59,039
We still don't know

546
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:03,079
how Nikolaev came to be there.
He was already 27,

547
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:06,399
a senior lieutenant in the police.

548
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,079
But he was there.

549
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,639
Look, there's Nikolaev in the hall.

550
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,840
See what happens now.

551
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,400
The waltz breaks off

552
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,559
and rock'n'roll starts up.

553
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,400
They are confused.

554
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,400
You can't tell
who's changed the music.

555
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:40,559
Now watch Nikolaev.

556
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,920
This was a great scandal.

557
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,680
The biggest since the revolt
of the the Social Revolutionaries.

558
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,599
Now look at this young man.

559
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,039
The Secretary of our Young Communist
League, Nikolai Smorodinov.

560
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,200
The next day he expelled

561
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,599
the dancers from the YCL.

562
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,720
Nikolaev was sacked from the police,

563
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,880
and the girl Shulakova was
thrown out of the medical school.

564
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,759
She took acetic acid.
They saved her life,

565
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,400
but her vocal chords were burnt.

566
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,720
She could never speak again.

567
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,520
Nikolaev got a job
in the restaurant.

568
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,360
He was resigned and calm.

569
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:30,679
But I knew that sooner or later

570
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,519
he's try something and I wasn't mistaken.

571
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:37,279
Only he could turn his own death

572
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,680
into such a circus.

573
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,720
You know, the prosecutor thinks
that Nikolaev was murdered.

574
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,679
And do you know that our prosecutor

575
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,599
is that same Smorodinov

576
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:58,440
who expelled Shulakova
and Nikolaev from the YCL.

577
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:05,279
This is all very interesting but...

578
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,960
What's it got to do with me?

579
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:15,599
Well, today is the opening

580
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:19,880
Of our town’s Nikolaev rock'n roll club.

581
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:25,760
I'd like you
to speak at the opening ceremony.

582
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:29,479
Me?

583
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,920
Why me?

584
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,079
You're Nikolaev's son.

585
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:00,239
Okay, let's get up on stage,
it's time to begin.

586
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,400
Thank you for coming.

587
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,520
Hello, Nikolai Ivanovich.

588
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,119
Well, are you going to speak?

589
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,119
What can I do?

590
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,320
This is all so crazy.

591
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,800
What can I say
about a man I've never met.

592
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,400
Say what they usually say

593
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,440
in such cases:

594
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,039
He was a good man,
and all that stuff.

595
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,760
But I'm supposed to talk
as if he was my father.

596
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,640
Alexei Mikhailovich, 
we're waiting for you!

597
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:34,800
Dear friends! Today our town sees

598
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:38,279
the opening of a rock'n roll club!

599
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:44,159
Yet another great victory
for democracy!

600
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,039
Through the periods
of Stalinism, voluntarism,

601
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,400
subjectivism and stagnation,
we have preserved

602
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:55,680
the passionate desire to dance

603
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,800
like we want to.

604
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,039
The first to dance rock'n roll
in our town

605
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:07,639
was the chef Nikolaev.

606
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,680
The first always has it rough.

607
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,760
But then comes the second,

608
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,600
in the unstoppable process

609
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:23,319
of historical logic!

610
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:33,840
Allow me
to introduce Nikolaev's son.

611
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,920
Ladies and gentlemen!

612
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:55,079
I must be honest and say

613
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,639
that I didn't know
the famous man very well.

614
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,559
Life decreed that we would 
rarely see each other…

615
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:06,039
actually only once.

616
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,039
He was a very good man,

617
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:13,600
a good chef.

618
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,440
I had some soup and beef… not bad at all…

619
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,560
Can you dance rock'n'roll?

620
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:20,760
Well...

621
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,000
I used to in college.

622
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,920
Dance some then!

623
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,320
Yes, do!

624
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,559
Rock!

625
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,400
Let's all dance.

626
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,920
Silence, please.

627
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,039
He could never

628
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,159
have shot himself.

629
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:51,439
He didn’t have the guts.

630
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,279
Now watch how it's done.

631
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,400
We want to see Varakin.

632
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,039
- I'm Varakin.
- Can we come in?

633
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,119
Yes, please.

634
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:17,559
Sit down.

635
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:37,000
'My name is Lydia Shulakova

636
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:41,759
'and this is my son.' That's me.

637
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,880
What can I do for you?

638
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:50,079
'I am the Lydia Shulakova

639
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:57,640
'who danced rock'n roll
with Nikolaev,

640
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:05,519
'for which I was expelled
from medical school,

641
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:13,319
'and then drank acetic acid
and lost my voice.'

642
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,840
I remember Chugunov
told me about you.

643
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,360
'I have a few things
which belonged to Nikolaev.

644
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:34,279
'They mean a great deal to me,

645
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,279
'but I want you to have them.'

646
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:07,399
Thank you.

647
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,559
But if they mean so much to you,

648
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:15,039
perhaps you will keep them?

649
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:23,119
'Thank you

650
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,360
for being so much like him.

651
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:32,159
'You have kept our ideals alive.

652
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,000
'I want to dance with you.'

653
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,880
Good evening.

654
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,960
Ah, there's Alexei Varakin.

655
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,040
Stepan Ivanov.
Pleased to meet you. 

656
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:40,679
Our town's mayor.

657
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:44,680
And this is Lydia Shulakova herself.

658
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:47,399
Pleased to meet you.

659
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,600
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

660
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,680
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for helping.

661
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,800
Things are a long way from finished.

662
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,720
That’s true. A lot has to yet be done,

663
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:07,800
but we've made some progress.

664
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:11,479
True, but the rehabilitation
of rock'n'roll

665
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,760
is of great political significance.

666
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:16,960
We can't be satisfied with that.

667
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:19,479
We're not satisfied.

668
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,119
The hero of the day.
Why did you come here?

669
01:21:45,479 --> 01:21:48,199
I came to see Alexei on business.

670
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,360
If it's business, come on in.

671
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,239
Why'd you make such a fool
of yourself, Nikolai?

672
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,560
Turn it up, Victor.

673
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,320
- You'll destroy Russia.
- You're destroying her!

674
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,920
That's enough, no more of that!

675
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,560
Will you be with us long, Alexei?

676
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,960
I have to get to Moscow.

677
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,400
- Can you help me get out of here?
- You can't leave now.

678
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,519
Can I have a word
with you in private?

679
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:37,239
By all means.

680
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,400
Could we talk right now?

681
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,920
I'm ready.

682
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,239
Maybe we could go out
into the corridor?

683
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,440
- Hello.
- Hi, Pavel!

684
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:12,200
I was walking along and I saw
these girls outside your door,

685
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:14,679
so I invited them in.

686
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,519
We called you, remember?

687
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,199
We made meat dumplings and 
brought some beer.

688
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,000
- Meat dumplings? Great.
- How could you be so stupid?

689
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:40,719
Leave me alone.

690
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,920
Okay, let's have a beer.

691
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:09,319
To progress.

692
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,600
I won't drink to that.

693
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,079
If you won't drink to progress,
drink to your mother.

694
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:18,839
I'll drink to that.

695
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,360
What'll we do with the dumplings?
We don’t have any plates.

696
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,760
Here's a spoon.
Eat them from the pot.

697
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:42,559
Alexei, would you help Tamara

698
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:46,559
exchange her room

699
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:48,960
for one in Tbilisi?

700
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,440
Only if it's a three-way exchange.

701
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,360
We can't let Tamara
go off to Tbilisi.

702
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:59,479
We need our beautiful girls here.

703
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,279
No, seriously,
I see you're a Soviet Deputy.

704
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:09,399
At the moment I’m not a deputy,
I'm merely a man in love.

705
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:12,159
That didn't take long.

706
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:15,919
By the way, Stepan,

707
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,079
we don't have a chief engineer.

708
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,159
We wanted to sing for you.

709
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,840
Let me sing a song.

710
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,199
- Just sit down.
- But his voice isn't bad.

711
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:39,120
'The Sokolov choir
at the Gypsy cafe??

712
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:44,159
'Was famous in its time.

713
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,800
'And the Sokolov guitar

714
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:52,279
'Still rings in my ears

715
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:56,199
'Always money, money, money

716
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,760
'Always money, gentlemen.

717
01:26:00,439 --> 01:26:03,399
'Without it life is rotten,

718
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:06,920
'And just a waste of time.'

719
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,680
Mind if we join you?

720
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,560
- Who are you?
- We're in the next room,

721
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,239
here on business from Kiev.

722
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,199
We heard you singing
and thought we might drop in.

723
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,520
- We've got beer.
- Where are you from?

724
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:30,079
We're from here. I'm the mayor.

725
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,440
Our public prosecutor,
the director of the factory.

726
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,279
And this is Chugunov, the chairman

727
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
of the local writers' association.

728
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:44,119
All local townfolk.

729
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,880
Varakin isn't.

730
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:51,880
Ah, yes, Varakin,
the son of chef Nikolaev.

731
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,560
A fine gathering.

732
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,239
Are you going to listen or not?

733
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,480
- We’re singing and you’re talking!
- You're singing nonsense.

734
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,720
Then sing yourself!
That’s enough.

735
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,639
- Okay, Nikolai, go on.
- You're not listening.

736
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,560
What song would you like, Alexei?

737
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,519
Me?

738
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,440
'The night is bright,
above the river

739
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:36,039
'Brightly shines the moon,

740
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:40,679
'And the blue waves

741
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:45,119
'Are edged in silver.

742
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:49,599
'The woods are dark and silent and

743
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,359
'Among the emerald branches,

744
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:57,239
'The nightingale hides,

745
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,319
'But sings no thrilling song.

746
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,320
'In the light of the moon

747
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:08,840
'Brihgt blue flowers have blossomed,

748
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,960
'Stirring in my heart

749
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,840
'Restless dreams.

750
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,680
'On this moonlit night,

751
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:24,439
'Beloved, darling friend,

752
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,000
'Think of me again

753
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:32,119
'And love me as before.'

754
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:55,880
Let's go to the oak tree.

755
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:00,840
Alexei, we have an oak tree

756
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:05,079
that Prince Dmitry Donskoi
once sat under.

757
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:10,199
That's right, let's go.

758
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:49,960
This oak is 1200 years old.

759
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,560
In pagan times it was sacred.

760
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:58,479
Anyone who pulled off a branch

761
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,000
became the leader.

762
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,239
But to hold on to his power

763
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,920
he had to protect the tree.

764
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,640
So of course sooner or later

765
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,680
someone killed him,

766
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,119
tore off a branch,

767
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,559
and became the leader himself.

768
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,760
In civilized society this custom
outlived itself.

769
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:27,239
Prince Dmitry Donskoi,

770
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,400
and later Ivan the Terrible

771
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:33,479
both pulled branches off our tree.

772
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,800
Since the 1917 Revolution
it has been protected by the State.

773
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:41,319
- Can we have a little branch
for a souvenir? - No way.

774
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,760
A tiny little one.

775
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:47,479
Let her take one.

776
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,840
Well, if the town Soviet
says it's okay...

777
01:31:57,399 --> 01:31:58,679
Dammit.

778
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:00,399
It's rotten.

779
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,680
We should’ve watered it.

780
01:32:03,079 --> 01:32:05,680
Now that one's off,
everybody take one.

781
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,279
- This one's too small.
- That's a good branch.

782
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,800
Can I take one for my brother?

783
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:24,679
Run for it!

784
01:32:26,439 --> 01:32:27,719
Run!

785
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:30,759
What?

786
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:34,439
Run, I tell you!

787
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:36,399
Which way?
