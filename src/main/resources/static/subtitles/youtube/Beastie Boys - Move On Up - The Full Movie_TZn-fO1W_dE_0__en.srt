1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,339
yeah

2
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:36,079
the smartest dumb band in the land

3
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,570
the Beastie Boys mix heavy blues smart
samples and the lowest common

4
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,230
denominator gut punches this new york
trail consists of Adam Horovitz or King

5
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:54,829
ad-rock as he is otherwise known adam
yauch AKA NCAA and Michael diamont

6
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:01,729
affectionately known as mike d the band
story started a long time ago way back

7
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:07,759
in the late nineteen seventies America
at the time was facing start of the home

8
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,469
and Reagan era as a new breed of
disillusion who was beginning to come of

9
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:13,280
age

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,409
this is the never told before story of
The Beastie Boys musical evolution

11
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,409
you

12
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:39,780
oh right sure what had you do what I do

13
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,320
bestie boys actually started life as two
separate bands that would eventually

14
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,809
evolve into one like DS band was a
full-piece group called the young

15
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:03,650
Aborigines who are young Aboriginal they
were Mike and John mean mainly the first

16
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,570
started out just as my concern

17
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:11,810
your theory is a full member of the
beastie boys from the original lineup

18
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,210
I played the time germany played bass

19
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,409
I played his drums after a while I got
the notion to introduce my two best

20
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:25,590
friends Mike and John and masterminded a
an introduction by buying ticket for Joe

21
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,240
Jackson and as soon as the first band
kicked into the in John start howling

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,069
like the main

23
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:38,429
I acted wildly jumping around and don't
forget it i just in his chair he didn't

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,819
stand up just bouncing down after their
set ended

25
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,979
John's bathroom and my company just
discussing let's discuss crazy don't you

26
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:47,908
get that

27
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:51,298
Jeremy told me that Mike but that I was
added my

28
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,370
and was wondering if there's anything
really seriously mentally wrong with me

29
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:00,209
I was like no no no he's cool he's cool
don't worry

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,860
good good guy and I've never been to a
concert before and so I'm act like that

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,150
before but obviously you know something
about the music and spent setting

32
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:16,439
something often and so after that though
might wind up and we sort of discovered

33
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,439
that we had the same interests and

34
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,260
both love the clash I came up with the
suggestion i said hey we want you guys

35
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,259
play together you know

36
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:35,780
and it was just a terrible terrible
combination is none of us knew how to

37
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,419
play but I mean we have a lot of
enthusiasm

38
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,958
let's say we were for lack of a better
word a jam band

39
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,089
it's terrible term but it's just been
whacking off basically

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,530
yeah

41
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,699
here we got a picture of the young
Aborigines and this is the only full

42
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,589
frame print I've got and got John Mike
and me at johns house you can see the

43
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,959
beer bottles lined up on the way

44
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,629
all there

45
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,189
some you know hubcap and in the back
here you can actually see a little bit

46
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:31,120
of Kate's kit kit kit was made up of
John's of a mikes old kit and this big

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,009
conga drum that John's father had and a
bunch of the missing Mike's kid is

48
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,120
pretty snazzy

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,530
I had some bootleg base and i think john
at gibson SG you can see there's like

50
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,039
the way of concealing food is just the
details it's all right there

51
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,129
yeah

52
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,080
yeah

53
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:09,098
yeah

54
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,230
and

55
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:43,240
the young in the useless were a hardcore
punk band they were a little bit younger

56
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,480
than pc boys you know

57
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,879
read more of its own guitar Arthur
africano and base David silken lead

58
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,980
singer and I was a drummer

59
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,819
The Young and the useless was Adam
Horovitz his band

60
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:02,610
Adam Tracy was the youngest of the group
can I met then I was still 12

61
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,688
and

62
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,099
type guess we probably rehearsed for a
month or something before we started

63
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:13,808
playing out and I may have turned 13 at
the time I don't have any new anybody

64
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,009
else to play the drums

65
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,869
maybe it's time we didn't rehearse a
whole lot anyway and i think my dad

66
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:25,959
bought me a drum set so that helped him
the enemies list played with us several

67
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:34,598
times i believe at this great club
called a 7 a-7 was another haven for

68
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,800
those hardcore kids most of us he should
have been probably in bed

69
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:45,699
snuck out of their houses because it was
a school night and it was is a great

70
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,838
place to play

71
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:50,379
yeah we put our first gig here and I was
so nervous are our sons were extremely

72
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,169
fast to begin with but i was so nervous
that I was playing like three times as

73
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,338
fast as everybody else

74
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:58,149
my sticks kept find out of my fit in
adelaide river Adam looking back at me

75
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,540
like i was adamant mine

76
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:09,069
he was like playing in your living with
a lot of drunk and scary children and

77
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,089
the young useless managed to blow
everyone away

78
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:16,869
I was actually in rehearsal studio with
my other band what band is going to

79
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,509
college and next door was young in the
useless and I mean we're getting a quick

80
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:29,589
look at them and then it seemed like
next thing I knew John Berry was out and

81
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:35,259
Adam horrible to me and i'm asking like
why and I just mostly have to do with

82
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,599
the John showing up late you know not
being on time for things i was a bad bad

83
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:50,139
boy and turning too much alcohol is in
rural experimenting leave the jack

84
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,999
kids out there stay away from the booze
bad stuff for you

85
00:07:58,658 --> 00:07:59,610
terrible

86
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,389
yeah

87
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,589
the hardcore punk scene centered around
a small record shop in New York's east

88
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,319
village called rat cage records

89
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,790
well I'm number first time in that case
records in about nineteen eighty-one and

90
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,669
they were it was a little teen store
that was underground black aids was a

91
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,019
record store and then done

92
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:28,068
ninth street between second and third
avenues ill just about across the street

93
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,360
from the selca diner

94
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,490
the team just kind of a focus . a place
we could go to get the new records

95
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,049
you've got to sure to get badges you
know Dave Parsons was the owner

96
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,309
I mean Dave shops stay open till four in
the morning at least we just hang out

97
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:49,699
there and II just hang out i mean it was
sort of like a base camp

98
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,450
Dave Parsons came up to us and said a
this recorder record which we were

99
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,080
course completely

100
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,990
excited about he was really a big
believe in the music and he actually

101
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,470
started the recording people and started
his little rock a record label

102
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,199
we went to studio and

103
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
recorded BP

104
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,740
pollywog still the name they gave EP I
can't remember that there was some

105
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,870
reference some inside joke between the
four of them that led to that title

106
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,620
it was a great experience

107
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:35,028
a lot about actually trying to play the
recording a lot different than playing

108
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:39,379
for an audience and it turned out great
you know is it was a secret because it

109
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,970
was a great thing

110
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,769
all the songs on we're about stuff that
really happen most of this like a great

111
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:46,939
on mojo

112
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,270
I mean that was a real incident there
was a sign a mojo

113
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,629
he was a bouncer at the club and we
hated him because he would never let us

114
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,909
into the damn Club so we decided that
there was gonna be a great on mojo that

115
00:09:58,909 --> 00:09:59,389
we looking at

116
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,750
literally you know the old halloween
trick and take a dozen eggs and throw

117
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,409
the matter

118
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:08,059
and now if this ever actually happened I
don't know I was not their provision

119
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,989
actual egg throwing it may have happened
but nonetheless these frustrations

120
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,120
turning to the song a great on mojo and
you know

121
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,549
next thing you know he was probably
bounced people out of the show that they

122
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:21,240
were playing people want to adam yauch
into the folds while at the same time

123
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
changing the name to the beastie boys

124
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:49,500
the Beasties were now an established
part of the New York hardcore scene even

125
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,909
managing to get gigs at the legendary
home of punk rock CBGB's

126
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,019
yeah

127
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,620
yeah

128
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,578
yeah

129
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,649
you know what is CBGB's everybody wants
to know everybody knows I don't have to

130
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,649
tell anybody with CBGB's doing

131
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,909
place where I think you know really
started

132
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:25,100
what they call punk rock to me hardcore
was like it came out of the punk rock

133
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,110
thing you know the Sex Pistols Ramones
and

134
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,350
it was faster than then punk rock it was
a lot of slam dancing it was very angry

135
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,089
we were sort of the younger brothers and
sisters of the pump

136
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,550
yeah

137
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:47,789
two guitars bass & Drums play really
fast

138
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:53,099
vocals are shouted you know it's a sore
back to 76 pump and the answer something

139
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,490
about hardcore at the time to clean 1982
in downtown New York was how immediate

140
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:07,769
and accessible it was you could sort of
go to CBGB's on a day of the Saturday

141
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,459
matinees on saturday and sunday would
have a matinee and that was the scene

142
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,369
pretty much everybody there was the
scene and you can talk to anybody and

143
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,750
they would never record out that was
locally distributed and and that was it

144
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,740
it was very immediate they would they
would like write a song recorded and and

145
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,089
make a record

146
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:32,820
hardcore well I call hardcore punk is
the the punk rock

147
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,509
yeah

148
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,220
yeah

149
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,389
the second time they recorded without me
this time and with adwords louis vuitton

150
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:55,669
they decided to record this thing called
cookie voice and Adam what's basically

151
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,490
crying called carvel ice cream

152
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,919
they have a cake called the cookie plus
it's an ice cream cake for birthdays and

153
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,360
the crank called the

154
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,028
store probably made someone's life
miserable and they put it all on tape

155
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:13,490
and it was bringing hilarious

156
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,789
no it's terrible to keep this is
terrible they can't play they had

157
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:20,000
absolutely no ability of sounding just
like the work hard core record in the

158
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,019
world

159
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:26,089
Chuck Klosterman was interviewed the
Beastie Boys on many occasions and they

160
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,079
remained in cookie puss and that became
like a white rat man you know they'll be

161
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,799
working in record stories and Danny
there's no way to defend successful is

162
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:42,139
table for the first rookie boost that's
the pack 3 is a hip-hop legend that has

163
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,850
known the Beastie Boys for many years I
was like this kind of weird record it's

164
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,909
out of more hip-hop that it did
alternative but they were always did

165
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:54,828
like i'll turn the band thing but it's
cool because i think it's cool red

166
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:58,789
respectively because people have you
know that they can see that the career

167
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:03,319
arc of this band and you know anytime
something become super popular become

168
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,339
disinterested like its board also
there's only so much underground secure

169
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,180
alternative man you never knew

170
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:15,569
that on acid one day cookie puts brought
him to the attention of another unlikely

171
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,740
rap fan a long head student at New York
University

172
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,759
they weren't really serious about music
and clearly they weren't serious because

173
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,759
when someone said days in your app and
they're like okay let's do that

174
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,709
suddenly they got asked to to play
places and play cookie puts well to do

175
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,899
that you really need the DJ rick rubin
was working on

176
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,490
this dorm room and nyu Adam took me over
there and

177
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,000
I met everything

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,360
I thought this is a guy who's

179
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,459
very serious about taking these guys

180
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,639
further and I remember when they came to
rick and ask him

181
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,169
will you will you DJ caise Rick had the
gear you gotta remember Rick had the two

182
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:02,028
turntables a mixer and the big sur 1
vega so he actually could DJ so suddenly

183
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:06,828
it was like they turn to direct and Rick
Rubin became DJ job loss is a double

184
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:12,559
lock and even had interest in becoming a
producer and you know and obviously like

185
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,778
he ended up becoming yeah

186
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:18,289
arguably like the most important
producer of the eighties but at the time

187
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,980
he was just this guy just I think that
the beastie boys are really but i did

188
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,420
not pee

189
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:27,828
man am I thought allowance they've
finally like they've got someone here

190
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:34,879
who really cares about them and once you
are you bring them to form

191
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,000
he was a very ambitious guy we all know
you would

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,870
he was making replicas dorm at NYU right
I mean that's the legends anyway

193
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,549
he was very into rap and hip-hop and I
mean when he heard them or saw them

194
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:55,929
something else is just click on that one
doesn't do this is it friend and former

195
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:01,149
roommates quick reading it was really
about the energy it was what it was what

196
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:05,470
Rick Rubin saw initially that there
really wasn't this wide gulf between

197
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,110
what punk was doing in its essence and
what rap was doing in its early essence

198
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,250
it was still it

199
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,600
the energy was still there and the and
the ability to just do something like

200
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,019
like this role and and angry

201
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:23,079
rap music was new it was underground

202
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,480
it was in the clubs and when you played
a rap record in a club or a party

203
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,289
he built the grandest emotional
everybody I remember the rules tell me

204
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,469
it's like yeah i got these parties to DJ
with with the Beastie Boys and was

205
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,070
quickly put the cookie puss with way
more successful than anything the

206
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,360
beastie boys or young useless or
whatever other bands they were had ever

207
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,050
done

208
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:46,870
so it's like you know it doesn't take
too much of a genius to figure well

209
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,470
that's that's a good road so they kept
going down that road and then Rick

210
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,470
Rubin's ideas kicked in

211
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,690
the one thing about rap music

212
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,430
you have to sing you can wrap to wrap
you can get a rhythm and you have the

213
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,558
right beat you can win

214
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,129
now you can talk to the beastie boys
they will tell you that like they always

215
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,720
grew up you know he you know intertwined
with african-american culture and it's

216
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,058
just part of you know their life

217
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:19,029
oh that's interesting because they all
went to like kind of really exclusive

218
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:22,990
expensive private schools like sometimes
wonder how many black kids that they

219
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,039
really knew growing up

220
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:32,859
sure with some but he'll York City rats
did give the beastie boys to consider

221
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:36,579
lot of credibility because I think a lot
of me in the black community

222
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:41,769
it felt like okay the beastie boys are
popular but there probably is popular

223
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,230
because white people already invited why
people like him

224
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,740
where you want to be wrapped around the
first time it was like black people

225
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,710
saying black people like you know these
guys

226
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,190
your life is white and they seem like
you know do whatever but they're

227
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,250
actually this is actually kind of music
you like

228
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,289
- so when they first walked on the stage
about rode your bike racks on the rack

229
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,079
on stage a white guy

230
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,678
how to earn his stripes and no one had
done that yet it's like if you want to

231
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,809
the Apollo and you were a comedian

232
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:14,319
the audience in the wrap and wrap at
that time we just like the audience

233
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,889
the black hole into the Apollo which a
wider audience sits there and goes ok

234
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,200
entertain me a black audience goes

235
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,289
what you got what you got sucker

236
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:28,450
basically because they want to be and
the page and you can put the fantasy

237
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,539
smudges for me is to you

238
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,990
and I think it probably seen maybe I
mean I yeah

239
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,470
white guys when I got out I always
wondered maybe in the black community if

240
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,509
the Beastie Boys almost seemed like a
novel

241
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:43,410
it was sort of like isn't it kind of
charming that these guys you know what

242
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,360
want to make the kind of music that we
invented

243
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,719
we walked over to me is I know your
backbone awful that is because the white

244
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,350
boys are there would be to it and I was
like wow that's just really presumptuous

245
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:58,349
of yourself and all those really

246
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,050
and when the Beasties first came on they
were not greeted with with widespread

247
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,279
upon approval but usually by the end of
their of their set

248
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,339
they would have won the Audience over
and they did that pretty quickly we did

249
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,599
a show in through Virginia and you had
five thousand little black girls

250
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,799
screaming howling try to make it 2-1
have a good time and and loving the guys

251
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,799
just generally because of they would be
real with what they were trying to say

252
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,049
they weren't trying to be last

253
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,099
we're trying to be the Beast keyboard
and it worked and translate the music

254
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,839
translated not the color

255
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,980
the reason why I Beastie Boys on it no
biggie they just make good records

256
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,049
DJ rather than is recognized and
respected worldwide as one of the

257
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,819
founding fathers of hip hop and now
playing in 86 it was a club called union

258
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:50,250
square and it was predominately black
and at that time there was to record

259
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:58,680
that was so popular one who's now hit it
and for we've it and to us it sounded

260
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,400
good we don't care what national I
wasn't just any good

261
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,180
we like what steps but it caught our
attention

262
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:11,320
sounding phone I'm just stuff that
sounds fucking like the beach with very

263
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,428
aggressive

264
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,729
so in hip-hop we always about the
aggressive means as far as stuff like

265
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:18,819
from Aerosmith stuff like from queen
stuff

266
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:23,259
billy squier ACDC so those kind of beats
what kind of similar to what they will

267
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,460
do with the alternative meet with the
big drums of the big powerful back has

268
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,788
introduced back and all that crazy
that's what we did just scratches so you

269
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,769
heard that it gives you good with that

270
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:36,489
think about that so we always use the
stick out like similar beat so it's kind

271
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,669
of like right there on the same thing
but I i was the commentary delivered

272
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:48,249
water sometimes being a black member of
a white group had its drawbacks

273
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:54,639
the time we want to perform over my
family apart and bought it was myself

274
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:58,508
and gonna be sitting inside you guys go
around the back because you know we

275
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,500
don't have black people

276
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,589
club right are you kidding

277
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,609
and they still have said you know they
can't come to we're not going to do

278
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:09,939
and of course such a big works is just
going to go ahead go ahead go ahead and

279
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,269
I heard them say I can you come back i
really need a lover

280
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:20,829
I was like you've got to be kidding me
this is my mom and this is 1986-87 crazy

281
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,829
and being with that come from

282
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,119
yeah

283
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,239
the beastie boys were slated to open for
Run DMC on the raising hell tour

284
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,339
the tour was special because it was the
first time rap music would be given such

285
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,929
global exposure

286
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,730
Rick without being a DJ and only the
label called def jam time very small

287
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,220
label how to group all hold on it for
real

288
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,029
this was long before LOL cool day before

289
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,808

290
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:05,230
he just got off the road with them with
Madonna things that you know I can do

291
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,019
this in turn illegal you should always
give me time to stop for a while she

292
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,250
said you wanted you and putting up the
creek

293
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,420
oh my god so buy them over to the
doorman I came over to hang out all

294
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,870
night long had a good time to each other
different from time to time whatever

295
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,640

village no you're great you know it's

297
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,170
and that's our relationship further from
the norms kept doing shows

298
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:37,509
don't do dream became the Beastie Boys
DJ but life on tool wasn't always great

299
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:42,759
we're just going to show out no
happening in the stadium but it was like

300
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,369
the hardest hottest day of the year

301
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:50,829
I wanted to do you can fry an egg on the
concrete without trying it was that

302
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,069

right now

304
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:58,029
yeah Drake was definitely an
uncomfortable situation I would say that

305
00:22:58,029 --> 00:22:58,899
for sure

306
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,720
DJ hurricane started office part of Run
DMC's entourage in the mid-1980s

307
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,830
being on that shuttle bus with those
wild dude and his hat recognition our

308
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,589
bus broke down so we had to go back to a
hotel

309
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:18,069
taking a shower and going on yeah I
remember that because they had a

310
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,329
bullshit bus

311
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:26,139
it was like well in a handicap band
songs because the bus at all

312
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,860
I went back and begin with these are you
always the last guy I don't leave any

313
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:33,759
better things like I went back to crowd
out the room I couldn't get in

314
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,910

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,890
are you crazy you know no I don't look
at that I gotta take a break down and

326
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,290
admit this beginning to piss me off but
midway through the raisin hell tour

327
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:27,549
dr. dre party with the beastie boys so
then they came in action

328
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,980
hope you DJ for us and I was still like
really hesitant because back then you

329
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,589
know I was so cool

330
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:39,819
I thought I was just so cool you don't
say and growing up with Hollis Queens be

331
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,259
on monday and see you know me

332
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:46,180
and you know they wanted to DJ for some
i doing that was very unheard of back

333
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,870
then you know white guys rapping and it
was wild and just throwing stuff all

334
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:50,739
over the place

335
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,220
i said i doing I never thought that I
would just keep doing it

336
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,370
I thought it was gonna be a temporary
thing about the body with the right

337
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:04,149
label on it he made of raising hell tour
was the craziest story I've been on in

338
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:12,490
my life and that tore open the doors for
hip-hop complete that broke the barriers

339
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:18,069
down that talk that so much publicity
and showed out so many concerts for the

340
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:23,079
first time here probably that everybody
was like wow dad to a really open doors

341
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,909
because it

342
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:31,720
wow you got to see with a little bit of
both worlds be trained in PCT and you're

343
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,789
seeing nothing but a whole set of people
that was so I know they say it all

344
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:37,659
barriers

345
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,380
it was just wild scene

346
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:47,240
girls screaming this a giant Budweiser
can stage four square root beers and

347
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,190
people you know and it

348
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,110
it was funny and I just thought man
that's you know basically what we're

349
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,729
doing is from grandkids

350
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,620
yes it was there was all the grocery of
sex drugs rock and roll going on all the

351
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:01,399
time

352
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,920
the beastie boys found out grabbing
antics were about to make the notorious

353
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,880
I remember just coming in our dressing
rules like the worst thing you can do

354
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,270
you know if you're coming to address
when he might get hit in the head with a

355
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:19,670
can of beer side by my squirt some
whipped cream and your face

356
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,409
anything can happen to you if you came
inside restaurant anything

357
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,670
the other problem was and this was a
major problem was they didn't realize

358
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:34,370
none of us realized there that half
their fans were 11 your own and 12 year

359
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:38,269
old kids 14 year old kids and at that
time 14 year old kids were not as

360
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:43,309
sophisticated as they are now they would
they had on a gigantic inflatable penis

361
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,569
on their tour they had the beer show
where they poured beer or ready

362
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:51,200
they did all kinds of great and this is
just a stripper occasion this is just

363
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,519
you know onstage

364
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,920
you can't you may God here at least had
much more to do with sort of like

365
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,120
obscenity they toured america with
Madonna

366
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,809
they were like the opening act for
Madonna so all of a sudden all these 12

367
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:11,990
and 13 year old girls were kind of being
exposed to do you know this band who was

368
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:18,169
out you know very sexual and had lots of
phallic imagery on stage and

369
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,700
I will seem to be in presenting
themselves as like potential molesters

370
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,340
oh my gosh on stage you're doing all
this crazy stuff they're cursing there

371
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,778
they're pouring beer there were girls
are dropping their tops and you've got

372
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:36,679
11 year old kids in the audience with
their fit with their family with their

373
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,440
moms and dads who brought them to the
show

374
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,519
that's where the real trouble started
today is a beastie boys an American band

375
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,509
calling itself the nastiest group in the
world arrived in London

376
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:50,509
they've flown in from Europe where
apparently they dogged the walls of

377
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:54,919
their hotel with human excrement wrecked
one bar hand in another ended up

378
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,840
throwing beer at other customers

379
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:02,988
I remember first going overseas and
people know who I was really kind of

380
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:06,829
brought me out first time I went over
there to get off the plane and seeing

381
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:10,519
people run up to you say yo what's up
the jerrycan yo what's up man we love

382
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,720
you able to kind of release that make
you say dad man this stuff is really big

383
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,720
now

384
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:24,259
the controversy really kicked in when
the Beasties towards Europe the British

385
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:29,239
Armed papers that they have made up a
live said that the beastie boys laughing

386
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:31,509
that purple kids

387
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:36,009
and when we got to Europe everybody was
like protesting us like really crazy

388
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:38,710
like I think one to kill us

389
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,390
maybe it's a shame that you have to
write articles make up lies to sell you

390
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,390
the papers really stupid

391
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,889
the Beastie Boys abandoned you were
dismissed them

392
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:57,970
I'm printable I remember given to
liverpool on the concert soon as I got

393
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,700
the turntables start scratching people
start doing big cans at me time I

394
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,210
fully-loaded big hands and I'm like a
duck in like someone will come and

395
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,079
towards my patient up and I was like you
know you're going to stop going to stop

396
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,710
right

397
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,289
something like let me have to bring the
guys are here and maybe they'll calm

398
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,009
down

399
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:18,129
demanding soon as they came out it got
worse

400
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,290
it was like ok corral I was running from
bullets and like going all kinds of

401
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,269
stuff and then i remember it was NCAA
picked up something and throw it back in

402
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,650
the crowd here and it hit somebody in
the next thing you know the police at

403
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,130
the whole turn

404
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:50,900
looking for a restaurant by dr. in 1986
the Beastie Boys released their debut LP

405
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,060
licensed to ill

406
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:58,549
the album was interpreted as a mindless
obnoxious party records when life is

407
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,849
built a map that was amazing

408
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:05,659
all about this Mike because it went to
number one

409
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,830
it was the fastest selling strange new
record in Colombia history the biggest

410
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:13,220
single is fight for your right to party
which is the song it like the Beastie

411
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,430
Boys now all hey and will basically
hardly hardly even get them talk about

412
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,940
it

413
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,490
average it it's certainly the closest
like hybrid between like the kind of

414
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:31,130
punk rock they were making clothes and
then the kind of like a suburban white

415
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,440
hip-hop and fight for your right to
party wasn't a hip-hop record but it was

416
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,170
they were hip hop group so by making
that wreckage and have a hip hop's and

417
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,810
made them get rock fans more rock fans
to listen to hip-hop

418
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:52,159
also it's a really straight jean that's
really flats on in there against me up

419
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,120
when I seen flat I mean it's just sort
of like certainly innovative it is

420
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,539
basically like the kind of sign you
would write if you were an 8th grader

421
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:03,619
the world was introduced to the boys
with their top 10 single and video

422
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,529
you gotta fight for your right to policy
you could put black and white leader on

423
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:12,319
that song is shown at MTV and it would
have been a hit

424
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,919
in fact maybe we should have put black
and white leader on it and show on mtv

425
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,080
because it might have been it anyway

426
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,259
virtually any video for that song
would've been big what would have been

427
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:26,329
it would have been as big as this know
because this video also put the Beasties

428
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:30,418
on mtv bragging about how great they
were

429
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,009
it was designed to be played on MTV it
wasn't even at the time wasn't going to

430
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:39,749
play form of it wasn't gonna play the
new style but they knew this song you

431
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:40,889
could do a great

432
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:46,829
braat braat song like you said and
visually would work and it will get them

433
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:51,148
wanting to be and get them set up and
that's what did for that all the people

434
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:54,118
that you see in that video are friends
of there

435
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:57,209
I mean there's the guys from Murphy's
Law and I are there is an answer stop

436
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,889
can we just stop all I mean everything

437
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:04,949
there's all these people are just
friends could have started DJ right know

438
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,850
every trick room and showed up I mean
everybody was just friends

439
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:14,730
the video includes a lot of people
getting hit in the face with lies and

440
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,679
what kind of important about that is a
sense that even you know even to a

441
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,379
thirteen-year-old kid in 95 that sort of
stupid that's sort of like kind of like

442
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:29,488
comedic value from the fifties or
whatever but that's kind of what they

443
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,149
were

444
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:34,829
it was like conscious stupidity my
mother and father played the parents in

445
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:38,819
the video and actually Taylor pretty
funny that I don't know what was great

446
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:43,079
was that at the very end of the last
visual joke is that the mother comes

447
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:46,599
home sees the destruction wrought by the
beastie boys in the

448
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:51,219
apartment and is like looking around
bewildered and then she then gets a PI

449
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,298
interface

450
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:56,710
no nobody at the heart to like throw the
PI interface because everyone even

451
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,740
though she was like it's fine just do it
she was dying I think I'm gonna shoot

452
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,710
that she was just nobody really at the
heart so finally what we have to do is

453
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,919
nobody could really throw it so they
framed up a very tight shot of her face

454
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,299
had turned tricks hand and he just has
the pines and just slowly like ice

455
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:14,079
crushes the blind race for me was
perfect because she had glasses we have

456
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,529
which meant it wouldn't get a ride which
is great but the glasses got all caught

457
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,369
by the pie

458
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:23,139
I got a lawyer yeah and i remember on
mtv they said that one of the guys who

459
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,500
directed this through the pine his
mother's face at the end

460
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:33,308
nice going kid right well that's
controversial american band The Beastie

461
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:38,769
Boys is being blamed for curious crime
currently sweeping the sound these last

462
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:44,829
month's sales of VW emblems rocketed by
a hundred and thirty percent 6500 these

463
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:50,769
were sold mostly young people who want
to stick around then next we started not

464
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:54,158
going to say that we stole me but that
was that was his thing I mean you know

465
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,919
when your daughter they started wearing
that we like about the ripping off of

466
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,210
the yeah that's right far

467
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,250
I mean when we heard about we heard
about that kind of stuff and not

468
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,390
specifically that it was it was better
all the rage when you knew where they

469
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,389
were getting this stuff and they weren't
paying for it legally or anything I mean

470
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,690
you knew all that was close kind of the
between thing about it was that they

471
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,190
were you know anybody was wearing an
emblem from a card you know they stole

472
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,300
it for a car and and that was kind of

473
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,039
the thing about it so my team really i
think started to be w thing on yourself

474
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,239
and you're not even up you know when we
might be a pain for now I'm eating a lot

475
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,299
of us what we put out that we're def
enjoying ourselves having a good time

476
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,570
hopefully not harming anybody else a
number of things happen because of that

477
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,260
video

478
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,960
apparently some kid had a fight for your
right to party party in somewhere in the

479
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,329
United States and almost burned down his
house

480
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,730
600 and I felt a mixture of sadness and
and pride the boyfriends name is the

481
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,059
members in the community came from but
they were making it very clear that like

482
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:58,340
you know it's not that we just seemed um
it's like we want to be as dumb as

483
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,660
possible which I think really relates to
people that age you are looking to be

484
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:05,119
absurd for no reason all the time

485
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:15,440
everybody wanted us to perform that song
on their TV show in their cities at the

486
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,389
birthday parties without really trying
it kind of became this very like and I

487
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:25,069
can seem excited and anthem for their
mindset at the time

488
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,820
wherever they can get us to go and do
that song

489
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,140
they got us to go do it that song was
was huge

490
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:37,170
that song was the one I would say so
long those records for license they're

491
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,099
the kind of people buy that record could
relate to it I guess because they wanted

492
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:47,400
to have parties you know it was amazing
it was it was a huge selling record i'm

493
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,599
feeling very proud

494
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,380
I always tell the story about my mother
because she likes to say when might use

495
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,480
to come over here to my house

496
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,360
he wouldn't he wouldn't talk to her you
would make eye contact he just mumbled

497
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,710
something and walk on down to my room
and she always had the same thought this

498
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,809
kid is not gonna amount to anything

499
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:08,190
she always say that and then fight for
your right to comes out and she's

500
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:14,940
dancing to it at an after ski bar you
know that the ski slope during 1988

501
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,519
they became involved in a bitter lawsuit
with def jam and rick rubin who claimed

502
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,369
that he was responsible for the group's
success

503
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:29,309
the group finally managed to break away
and relocated to California and all of a

504
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:33,539
sudden it gets the point in 1987 where
wait a minute there's a lot of money at

505
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,050
stake and they're like hey we want to be
a part of that they didn't say we want

506
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,650
it all but they were like where you know
suddenly you look at your contract and

507
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,320
you realize hey wait a minute i'm only
getting like this piece and you know

508
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,440
record companies getting this piece and
the record companies Rick Rubin Russell

509
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,539
Simmons and a big lawsuit followed in
basically Rick and they split and i

510
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,769
think that's that's part of the the
problems that they see that is before

511
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:59,610
they became in control of their own
destiny though they had a lot to do with

512
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,480
the videos

513
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,869
the breakup of of the Beastie Boys and
regrouping came about

514
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:11,250
basically because they learn the harsh
lesson that many forms learned which

515
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,170
which when you get successful you are
all of a sudden you you want to have

516
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,920
let's say you realize how little of
yourself and your own success

517
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,000
you're entitled to

518
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:36,949
yeah

519
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:40,098
in nineteen eighty knowing the Beastie
Boys released

520
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,940
Paul's Boutique the musical style was
entirely different

521
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,289
- licensed to ill many observers didn't
know what to make of it

522
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:56,080
Paul PT came out they looked it went to
Los Angeles and they were smoking a lot

523
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,469
of pod and being in like that was sort
of the aesthetic of that record we

524
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:04,329
started the slate bags donor and hip-hop
this with all like and probably involves

525
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:09,579
more samples than any major records ever
released in a sense that like you could

526
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,690
not afford to make Paul's Boutique now
with copyright laws on the your daily

527
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:18,489
not anymore really cracking down on the
use of samples and the use of material

528
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:22,089
I mean there are I there are hundreds
and hundreds of you know they'll be just

529
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,170
like you know snippet of a Bowie song
that just be you know and like all these

530
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,130
things they could never

531
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,910
you can never make that record now look
that's the end of like widespread sample

532
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:36,069
people didn't really catch on to people
was expected license to ill so they

533
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,070
didn't really respect Paul's team

534
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,590
they make this record and almost no one
pays attention to it because it's not is

535
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:51,559
superficially funny or as sort of
aggressively obnoxious all the things

536
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,029
that sort of made them famous initially
which really were kind of baggage of

537
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,860
license Dale that's all guys

538
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,000
I remember i'm up when Paul's Boutique
first came out and we start doing shows

539
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,690
and this breakfast cells didn't jump off
the way they're supposed to

540
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,710
everybody is looking kind of down about
it's like you know this is it's over

541
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:19,579
well I know adam said that like he
thought it was gonna be you like they

542
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:23,239
were they were working under the premise
that like okay this relapse records

543
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:27,769
still 12 million and this record is so
much better and so much more serious

544
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:31,099
you know it's going to be like Fleetwood
Mac's rumors is going to just be passive

545
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:36,858
and I did I don't know really how it
affected them because i think that you

546
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:43,549
know I success happening so quickly and
change their life so dramatically that I

547
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,950
don't know if they were really prepared
to make a successful record every two or

548
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:52,189
three years i think that they were
probably very close to end and

549
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:58,909
we went from visiting big arenas two
smaller ones

550
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:05,059
so it was definitely a gut check I think
you know either you down or you ain't

551
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,150
down you're going to jump off the ship
now you're not

552
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,160
I just get the impression that that as
personalities their life that all

553
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,480
changed and no one with dating on the
sky was inaccurate we're doing all these

554
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,539
other things you know and i think in a
sense maybe that that when politics

555
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:27,320
didn't do as well commercially they were
afraid of like well okay I with me know

556
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,470
we we still made all this money off our
first record we got all these cool

557
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:34,339
original and this record we like but
this is well you know we'll see what

558
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,820
happens

559
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,820
maybe this is the left record roll over
man

560
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,559
now respectively kind of the
conventional thing to say is that the

561
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,889
best Beastie Boys records policy but
almost no one body and it was completely

562
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:55,089
an extension of this idea that a lot of
people didn't take them seriously

563
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,530
license to kill

564
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,300
and then it was later that people shared
kind of rediscovering but there's

565
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,950
actually a lot of people say that but
also keeping it came on her life but now

566
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:10,659
people know Paul's Boutique you felt the
same people applied in like it back then

567
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:13,659
when i go back to listen to it now

568
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:19,039
yeah

569
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:29,480
check your head

570
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,329
the album they released in 1992 was the
first record since the hardcore days

571
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:40,880
where the Beasties play their own
instruments the Opie re-established the

572
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,800
Beastie Boys as a musical force in the
alternative scene and I think he just

573
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,410
decided to start playing again

574
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:52,819
so we kind of picked up the instruments
we kind of did it again

575
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,420
like came back in a different style when
we pick them up trying something else

576
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,050
out

577
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,160
check your head when i was at college at
the time it seemed like a big record

578
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:06,679
there now I I can't you know I'm sure
went platinum and their video like a the

579
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,309
video for what you want isn't even quite
a bit to get ahead you've done pretty

580
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:17,900
well but it was super popular among like
serious music fans at the time I can

581
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,720
check your head was I think that was a
really good genes out because it went

582
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:30,319
from just making all hip-hop album to
make him a whole complete album of hip

583
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,309
hop in little rock a little punks and
slow instrumental

584
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,899
they were one of the first kind of
outfits where it seemed like they were

585
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:44,750
like very consciously and very clearly a
merging hard rock and hip-hop and that

586
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,010
while they were together they still had
sort of the autonomous identities and I

587
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:54,680
crossing that record became a big deal
because it was sort of this kind of

588
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,899
social and universal discovery that all
actually the Beastie Boys there was just

589
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,710
funny band they're actually like this
brilliant man

590
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,429
like they have to get there there's a
lot of musicianship here and a real

591
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:12,489
understanding it's like politics
business out by the time they may take

592
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,809
your head

593
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:18,940
the musical climate completed in the
sense that and all this like there was

594
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,980
this new interest in alternative music
as the main string the response to check

595
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,210
your head was incredible

596
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,460
people loved it people love to see
instruments like when you came to the

597
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,929
show will check your head

598
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:35,829
I mean it was never done before now
you're not days you see people like a

599
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:42,639
let the skin and other rock bands trying
to do what we did back then which was

600
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:51,338
pick up instruments scratching with the
instruments rapping with instruments and

601
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:55,690
putting it all together and one type of
on one plate

602
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,720
I mean people were advising and they're
taking the beach boys but they were

603
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,039
revising in a way that was more accurate
that these weren't just personalities

604
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,389
these were actually like a very sort of
talented and sophisticated band

605
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:09,909
I mean that's the biggest thing check
your head did it kind of made people

606
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:14,170
come to the conclusion that the beastie
boys were musically sophisticated which

607
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,090
had not been the case in the past

608
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:22,240
in 1994 ill communication was released
its style was quite similar to check

609
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,250
your head but this time it was more
hip-hop focused like sabotage to me is

610
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,360
is a very clear example of like how the
beastie boys have been always able to

611
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,620
stay just slightly ahead of like the
cultural curve in a sense that when that

612
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,420
came out 1984

613
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,230
the one thing that seems really
interested them a lot and was a great

614
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,130
interest to this huge mass of of
listener who had I guess enabled

615
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,880
experiences was this sudden interest in
the nineteen seventies and seventies

616
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,630
culture

617
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,890
so when they made the sabotage video
which was really like sort of a mock

618
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:58,869
send-up of like American cop show from
the seventies like Starsky and Hutch

619
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:02,650
beretta and stuff like that was the
first time people heard that song and

620
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,849
solid images they like because MTV
basically broke that song and people

621
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:10,329
really liked the video and they like it
was directed by Spike Jones and was

622
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:15,400
really funny and it was really cool and
basically then position now the Beastie

623
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:21,070
Boys is like where they had been
previously like a college rock band

624
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:25,809
now they were like at home like a major
alternative rock band and sort of really

625
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:28,699
like one of the first rap rock bands

626
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:34,969
to me that was like my favorite little
communication because the tours that we

627
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:39,169
did a little communication the way we
used to rock the crowd when we did

628
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,740
sabotage and on shore shot

629
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:47,569
no songs like that I mean the crowds
used to go so crazy from the shows we

630
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,390
used to do i mean i wish i had some of
them on video

631
00:45:50,389 --> 00:46:00,650
it was just phenomenal that was a hot
year at the beach boys have suddenly

632
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,579
decided that they're now like sort of
like statesman and kind of like is a

633
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:06,560
diplomatic element to them

634
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,338
you know you're in there from New York
so like this record is like a tribute to

635
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:14,900
New York in the five boroughs of New
York and but a mean they have a song

636
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,849
called like to the five boroughs or no
no no an open letter to NYC

637
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:26,660
it was time for the open letter to NYC
and they basically just named places

638
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:31,368
like the lame certain locations in
certain subway lines and stuff and it's

639
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:34,970
more like you know like reading the
Zagat's guide is like a tutorial to like

640
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:39,078
hearing more things in New York are but
still even now two to play you know they

641
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,410
haven't had a record out in six years
they just had a record out the number

642
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:46,789
one record and if you ask anybody in
1987

643
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:52,670
will the beastie boys have a number one
record what is it's a 6 15 years later

644
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,858
more than 15 16 17 years later that
they'll make it even . for almost 20

645
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,779
years later that which they could they
come out

646
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,290
everybody thought well i mean i have a
good out and they had a really good year

647
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:06,920
and a couple of good songs but nobody
would have thought that they were they

648
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,349
were going to have it out

649
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:13,940
I will they probably get they probably
tore at this record and i will be well

650
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,130
for that making everyone and

651
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,789
they work slow they were kind of you
know part of what makes them cool for

652
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:21,489
visiting it can work on their own
schedule

653
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,489
there probably won't be on the Beastie
Boys records for five years

654
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:39,719
after a tracking holiday through Tibet
adam yauch was suddenly drawn to the

655
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,789
plight of the people there is cum trade
and culture was being occupied by China

656
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:48,570
he decided to stand up and do something
about it

657
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:55,470
resulting in the first Tibetan freedom
concerts held over two days into 1996

658
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:59,219
it was just this big interest in the
middle nineties in the United States

659
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:04,529
about 3 to bed and you will see it on a
bumper stickers on cars and you would

660
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,130
hear people talking about it became the
corner of like it was like a hipster

661
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,630
cause I'm the old and you're going I'm
going to hold and I don't know you need

662
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,250
to

663
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,050
like cool kids all of a sudden we're
taking this interest and you know

664
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,280
China's occupation of the bed and added
me out because one of the guys doing

665
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,030
like you know and I read about it and
use a week or something and he was like

666
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,370
yes this is important so he became this
sort of this very forward-thinking very

667
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,819
aggressive proponent of like Frank to
bed night

668
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,390
you really got beyond saying to bed
should be free but it kind of became

669
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:42,230
like is cause I don't know it's a girl
serious about our girls

670
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,469
I don't know i just got to get over that
should come along

671
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:51,049
jual beli love you out the valley love
it

672
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,940
ok ok you know what I get done because
you've got pounded in a piece by going

673
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,550
on the whole got me on that one

674
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:03,650
it's be off the bill come on do
something for us here what are you

675
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:09,200
giving us to pick you for these causes
weight gain would be security I mean

676
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,529
who's going to share like yeah well I
think China should be able to like Rob

677
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,740
these boxes of their color you always
going to disagree with freedom for the

678
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:19,939
bed yeah I just I just always think it's
funny whenever I see like a freaking bed

679
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,200
bumper sticker

680
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,199
I like a piece avoid future the Badgers
right well

681
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,589
I don't know how that's gonna manifest
itself in any freedom but you know it's

682
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:33,728
good you're thinking about it but to me
it was it was basically enjoying another

683
00:49:33,728 --> 00:49:34,509
concert

684
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:40,599
you know I mean yeah I wanted to do it
for that calls so it was cool with me

685
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:43,719
and it was cool with everybody else to
support him and what he wanted to do

686
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,249
which it

687
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,429
what what should really be happening is
that all of us should be thanking the

688
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:51,909
Tibetan people and the Chinese people
who are here who are speaking out

689
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:56,259
you should be thanking down for
participating in this not violent

690
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,998
struggle education

691
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:01,238
just dance two minutes and Counting try
to a political rock

692
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,068
anytime we're trying to do something
with political is get all these big band

693
00:50:06,068 --> 00:50:07,268
with you

694
00:50:07,268 --> 00:50:11,498
it gets a lot of attention at first for
its political leanings think this

695
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:15,488
becomes like over all the good bands
were like it just becomes the Woodstock

696
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:19,298
and it's like you know you get people
going to that show who you know I

697
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:22,568
wouldn't care if like to bed got
attacked by Godzilla you know what do i

698
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:23,380
do you think it is

699
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,858
when I got on stage you know I thought
to do that

700
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:31,298
let's let's go to work do we supposed to
do so much with it when that concert was

701
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:35,259
going I just don't feel like wow what a
great show this is because it was like a

702
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:38,469
beastie boys program and hold you know

703
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:42,099
managerial other gags and then I think
something that struck by lightning guys

704
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:43,390
that was the main thing anyway

705
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:46,598
although the Beasties were extremely
successful

706
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:52,599
not everyone associated with the band
was happy I was saying the reason why

707
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:58,298
I'm our part it was because it was like
the Beastie would work like every five

708
00:50:58,298 --> 00:51:04,568
six years and for me you know i got a
family I need to be constantly working

709
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:11,079
and you know it wasn't really benefit me
and my family

710
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,309
like work every five years I remember
like several times i'd be up there and

711
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:23,049
like you know what they were really
really be into it as much as I used to

712
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:23,950
be into it

713
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:28,359
financially I felt like I should make it
more than what i was getting you know

714
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:34,450
like if you go to work and you're not
happy with how much money you're making

715
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:39,640
when you have work you're not going to
be happy you know I mean no matter what

716
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:40,929
kind of job you doing

717
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:44,440
if you go to work and you like my own I
should be making some more money 1 i'm

718
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,730
making then you're not going to be
always concentrating all the way there

719
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,530
and that's how I felt I felt like I
should have didn't get making more money

720
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:58,690
than what I was making as far as how
long I was down after 12 years of loyal

721
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,769
service

722
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:02,769
DJ hurricane decided to leave the band

723
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:19,200
oh right sure

724
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:25,019
what are you don't what are you don't
have anyone who has spent time with the

725
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:30,690
bounds of always takes away special
memories always true personalities are

726
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:36,329
always hidden behind their comedic to e
gays but what are they really like I

727
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:41,940
first met my through my brother actually
because my brother was best friends with

728
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,650
Mike's older brother his oldest brother
David and so it just sort of naturally

729
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:51,269
happened that I became interested in my
plan B cross pads we gradually just got

730
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:51,920
more and more

731
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:59,568
and to use that between you know it's a
little child to recognize my DS to do

732
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:00,170
that

733
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:04,280
you know he's the guy that when Mike
comes on he wants to be to do is be

734
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,329
talking

735
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:10,970
he wants to take care of the business
part everything he wants to be spoken do

736
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:17,179
it at a group but not want to be is
basically for me Mike Dee was the quiet

737
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:19,879
when he was very smart though as well he
was very smart

738
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,059
quiet and in terms of the videos

739
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:28,099
he was the one that asked for the most
direction considering what he had four

740
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,119
trunks

741
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,390
he was a damn good drummer we had pretty
much

742
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,920
II the lowest form of just
bargain-basement drum set and

743
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,920
he worked it as well as he could

744
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,598
down down with this

745
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:53,230
I don't have it the actor of the blue he
was always the house he was the emotion

746
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,639
of a groupie

747
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:59,379
it was like the heart and soul and he
believed in this like this was his

748
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,369
life's work

749
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:05,200
this is what he had to do he believed in
the address that was his thing and I

750
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,809
really looked up to Adam orbits I
thought he was extremely funny and

751
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:13,369
he always wore like really cool clothes
his mom had a clothing store

752
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,910
I don't know whether we all dressed like
Adam or we all just stressed that way

753
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:23,449
ourselves but the whole like baseball
cap and you know t-shirt I don't know I

754
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:26,089
mean it just seemed like what we were
all wearing and then it became this

755
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:31,700
whole uniform in the nineties early late
eighties

756
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,690
yeah i was thought out of hilarious he
was just one of the funny to get my note

757
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:42,769
he enjoy being from there was a front
man to the beastie boys may be able o

758
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:47,659
damn with the Aqua be sexy guy Mike
diamond

759
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:53,210
he's good he's asked the manager
believer in the back bone in his own

760
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:56,780
bank but it would be a dark as though
the step afrika

761
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,480
you know he he was like the leader of
the young uses it was his band so and I

762
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,059
know because he was a couple years older
I mean those were just a big age

763
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:05,139
difference then

764
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:08,349
and you know I always looked up looked
up to him and thought he was saying like

765
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:12,099
you know whatever he thought was right
was probably right and you know he was

766
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:13,989
really funny and smart

767
00:55:13,989 --> 00:55:16,959
you know so i always had this like kind
of little brother feeling around around

768
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,679
him

769
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,829
Adam or which was actually at the time
and probably although I knew all three

770
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:22,630

and sometimes screenwriter Israel

772
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,549
harvests and we became pretty friendly
the minute

773
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,940
Adam told me that his father and covered
in an Italian gangster film with john

774
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,840
cassavetes which he didn't take credit

00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:10,649
he's going to think is wrong but i have
like they'll do

796
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:13,799
this

797
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,830
cool time to do is just sold

798
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:24,659
so gentlemen now you know yeah it was a
little more was the most assertively

799
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:28,589
three in terms of wanting his
independence the most in terms of being

800
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:35,640
the most independence and most outspoken
and and he was sort of laid back was the

801
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:40,500
quietest 23 but he was he was he was
laid back he gave a lot of thought to

802
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,219
what he wanted to do and they all did in
fact I mean they work together but he

803
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:49,349
was usually the ringleader whatever idea
they came up with in terms of anything

804
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:50,339
that they came up with

805
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,789
I think he would sort of become the
spokesman at certain time one night only

806
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:57,269
pushing their records

807
00:57:57,269 --> 00:58:05,070
you have this designation plunger see
the cartoons &

808
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:15,480
this plunger thing to detonate bombs and
you liked it you like to me close it's

809
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,960
one night we decided to blow up the name
is Michelle Parker

810
00:58:21,338 --> 00:58:32,978
so he's not going over yet jumped over
the fence planted a bomb and click the

811
00:58:32,978 --> 00:58:38,528
wire back trail that back up into his
room and set off a bomb

812
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:39,369
I don't know when

813
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:47,349
there are no but it went off at all we
just you know maniacally laughed and

814
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,539
yeah

815
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:51,820
losses

816
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,970
was it was fine you know it's just
there's no reason for you know what it

817
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,649
was just you know is silly

818
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:16,090
I think got a lot of trouble for that
actually despite an existence

819
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:21,460
that's bridged nearly two decades the
Beasties seem incapable of resting on

820
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:27,159
their laurels and just offering retreads
of their earlier work for a band that

821
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:31,480
was written off as a one joke novelty
acts the moment they came to mass

822
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,500
attention

823
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,389
they haven't done that badly they loom
pretty large in in rock and roll history

824
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:42,400
as probably as the first valid white
wrap

825
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,150
they have proved people wrong a lot

826
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:50,049
the no one thought that they would have
more than one market

827
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:58,720
Beastie Boys location we might say in
general year day during black sound

828
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:07,659
let's do it all they come across to mass
it to everybody to me

829
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:14,559
music music they're good people to their
they're always interested in another

830
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,309
band

831
01:00:15,309 --> 01:00:19,360
helping very good things have been
around for this long first of all there

832
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,180
going on

833
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:24,500
what is that one in three years I mean
it's a huge accomplishment and they've

834
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,369
kept their heads you know they've really
survive so many years later they're not

835
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:31,099
really just a footnote in music

836
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:34,250
they actually are able to pack

837
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:41,329
you know like arenas in fact every white
act whether they want to believe it or

838
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:45,829
not including kid rocking guys like that
they may be door Eminem they may be

839
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:50,510
different but every white app that does
wrap or something to them just like

840
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:54,950
every white rock and roll guy owes
something to Elvis

841
01:00:54,949 --> 01:01:02,269
I was some of this being one of those of
one of the greatest hip-hop group of our

842
01:01:02,269 --> 01:01:03,259
lives

843
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:09,710
definitely one of the top the ability to
continue to grow and reinvent themselves

844
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:12,710
and staying you

845
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,450
yeah

846
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:21,469
they're still valid they're still doing
it and it's from doing it well and they

847
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,439
still got a sense of humor about
themselves as a very key think some of

848
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,250
their legacy will

849
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:30,929
large Lucy Biggers work with at least as
big as Michelangelo with you know if not

850
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:33,929
