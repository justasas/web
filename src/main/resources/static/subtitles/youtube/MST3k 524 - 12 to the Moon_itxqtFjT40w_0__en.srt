works on atomic power right right right

1270
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:36,769
we must fashion a powerful atom bomb by

1271
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:39,109
assembling and uniting it's a number of

1272
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:43,429

it disperses the micrometeoroid clouds

1282
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:10,368
it should break an opening for the space

1283
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,788
taxi to go through yes it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>
