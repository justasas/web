I've read it three times I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

367
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,690
find the basic precepts which article

368
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,040
was that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can explain it I'd be</font>

conscious of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his own existence therefore</font>

372
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,759
conscious of the possibility of

living her life the same as before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>
