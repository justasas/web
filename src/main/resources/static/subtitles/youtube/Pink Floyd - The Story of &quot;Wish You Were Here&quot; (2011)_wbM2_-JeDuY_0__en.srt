00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:17,650
how

2
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,609
the same old ground

3
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">same or fees</font>

4
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,029
wish you

5
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,920
builder

6
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:41,240
it did stem from those first four notes

7
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,750
that popped out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guitar one day in</font>

8
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,750
Kings Cross

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,500
somehow those notes evoked a song about

10
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:58,789
Sid and his disappearance absence if you

11
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:03,650
like mean Roger it's my homage to Sid

12
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:07,280
and my heartfelt expression of my

13
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,229
sadness and and but also made my

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:20,569
admiration for the talent but and my

15
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:28,040
sadness but the loss of the friend I

16
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:30,739
think the song is brilliant innit sort

17
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,599
of evocation of what Roger obviously

18
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,759
felt about said and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it certainly it</font>

19
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,659
matches mine I think what was so

20
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,409
important was to not try and write him

21
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of history</font>

22

28
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:35,400

00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,598

you know the bright eyed Sid and his

34
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:50,419
singing and his guitar playing kind of

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,420
jumped out at you

36
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,810
by the time I was working with the

37
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,628
studio it was clear that the real

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,149
creative shape of the group emanated

39
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:21,589

<font color="#E5E5E5">that we were kind of finished at that</font>

and she may have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

78
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,050
I think we were at a watershed then and

79
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,788
we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily have split up then and</font>

80
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:56,050
we didn't because we were frightened of

once it was a shambolic am I mean it was

concerns about not making any contact

with the audience during<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of that</font>

we didn't we were but we were very

disconnected

108
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,400
if we weren't giving a hundred percent

109
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,080
we couldn't quite sort out why not you

110
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,019
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was an element of frustration</font>

which and having<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone tell us that I</font>

would have been one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things which</font>

115
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,490
would have once we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> over our</font>

117
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,940
board and realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was more</font>

118
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,940
than the germ of truth in

119
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:27,969
I was asked to record the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Floyd at</font>

120
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,629
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the Empire pool she's</font>

121
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:34,389
now at wembley arena and when I saw the

<font color="#CCCCCC">floyd before they went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on they said oh</font>

our sand injury and that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok how</font>

125
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:49,570
long lovely never 30 years and anyhow I

126
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:50,860
went back in the interval and they said

127
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,980
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think and i said it's</font>

128
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,700
rubbish because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

129
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:02,950
working with smaller groups on Smalling

00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:15,849
doing the next night at the Empire pool

133

no<font color="#CCCCCC"> goodies just take me back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I</font>

134
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,528
<font color="#CCCCCC">ended up doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the British</font>

135
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:24,009
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something better just worked</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hour and then assailing k wish</font>

137
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:29,289
you were here though a lot of days where

138
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,230
we didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything while they were</font>

139
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about ideas the reality was</font>

140
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,240
that we were struggling with making the

<font color="#E5E5E5">follow-up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dark side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we rushed</font>

142
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,480
back into the studio to do that you know

143
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,490
we put ourselves under at sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

144
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,820
ridiculous pressure in the way tried to

145

<font color="#CCCCCC">make a record from nothing he was</font>

146
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,629
disengagement it was not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font>

147
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:59,198
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply yourself sufficiently a lot of</font>

148
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:02,350
moments where any one of us might have

149
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:04,120
been much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interested in thinking</font>

150
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what they were doing that weekend</font>

151
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,350
it became a case of two would be in the

152
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:14,079
studio and two were running late or as

153
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:20,259
it was always<font color="#E5E5E5"> known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I play squash</font>

154
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:22,849
and then we had the dartboard with the

155
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:26,629
air rifle

156
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:33,079
the concentrated activity was rather

157
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:35,870
diluted and I'm sure for a a very

158
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,669
pushing driving sort of person like

159
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,620
Roger<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more frustrating than it was</font>

160

for any on earth although<font color="#E5E5E5"> considerably</font>

161
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,860
frustrating for all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect when</font>

162
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:48,470
I'm in the studio I'm there to do

163
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,600
something otherwise I'd rather be

164
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,959
somewhere else frankly and it's on there

165
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,959
to work

166
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,710
well you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bird the</font>

167
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:13,019
legendary argument that I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had</font>

168
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:14,759
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of them about my thought</font>

169
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,490
at the time that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better to use</font>

170
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other two tracks as well that we had</font>

171
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,919
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on I had to fight David for</font>

172
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,570
a bit as he acknowledges completely you

173
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">know he we had a completely different</font>

174
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:31,710
idea about it was and that was a and

175
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:35,250
that was a fight that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won Dave saw a</font>

176
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:40,379
record that had those two songs and

177
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:43,409
shine on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it felt cobbled together to</font>

178
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:46,169
me it didn't feel like like real and so

179
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:48,600
at some point in that process yeah I

180
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:51,360
said yeah I came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea no</font>

181
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,089
this has to be thematic and it and

182
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,680
that's where I expressed it

183
00:13:54,089 --> 00:14:01,680
this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this a more coherent work</font>

184
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,838
and in because it's more coherent it

185
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,399
will be better than if we just throw all

186
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,639
the songs we've been working on together

187
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,039
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go boom they are that's it there's</font>

188
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,269
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> song that's about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Syd but rest of it</font>

189
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:19,110
it's it's a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more Universal</font>

190
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:23,818
expression of my feelings about absence

191
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:26,409
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt that not that we weren't</font>

192
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:47,588
<font color="#E5E5E5">really there we were very absent</font>

193
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:50,500
remember tip common here dimple have a

194
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:52,810

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,149

201
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,800
exercises before I attempted that I

202
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:16,470
think the lyrics so much sum up the

203
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:23,750
recording business

204
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,750

go go

206
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:33,679
the record companies were they were all

207
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,689
powerful in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way no one worked</font>

208
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:41,899
without a record deal those days said

209
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:44,300
they play had a lot of power you're not

210
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,449
longer really an individual anymore you

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,509
you're a puppet you're not your own man

213
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:05,269
by the way which one is pink which one's

we're gonna run

216
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:20,949
it was with felt that since madness had

217
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:23,110
partly come about through the demands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

218

the record industry you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hit now</font>

I want you to do another<font color="#E5E5E5"> head I want you</font>

mean it's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> all i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to</font>

226
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,250
play a guitar and write a song and

227
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,278
suddenly I'm in the middle of all this

228
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the star thing doesn't make doesn't make</font>

230
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,680
can make you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to withdraw from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font>

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,490
and I must obliged you

234
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,490
a kiss

235
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,349
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was burned</font>

236
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,568
by the music business but actually it

237
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:12,719
was probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> burn bothered by us</font>

238
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:14,638
sidered<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of gone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

239
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,990
top of the pops of being sort of

240
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:19,359
commercial

241
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,620
I think it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the record company</font>

242
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,058
putting the pressure on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was us</font>

243
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,438
putting the pressure on because that's

244
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:25,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the way we wanted to go</font>

245
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,650
and I

246
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,029
and I

247
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:41,729
when you are my love

248
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,730
when I

249
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:54,739
now

250
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:58,009
have a cigar you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go from with have a</font>

251
00:17:54,739 --> 00:18:00,889
cigar both of them you that night room

252
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:04,249
could sing it I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave's</font>

254
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:10,389
always had a deep respect I mean that

255
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,388
motion city state

256
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,630
I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bears fantastic that is</font>

257
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,529
really what I think by the way which

258
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's pink that's right they wanted the</font>

259
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,269
ferocity which Roger give some other

260
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:30,699
tracks at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you just felt that he</font>

261
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:34,960
hadn't got it come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here dear boy have</font>

262
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,450
a cigar you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go far Roy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

263
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,720
definitely one of the great characters

264
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,480
around for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our early hour early</font>

265
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,670
life really we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do quite a lot of</font>

266
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouts why Roy would be on the bill good</font>

267
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:56,110
guy to have around I was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> stereo too</font>

268
00:18:51,670 --> 00:19:01,660
and they were in Syria three I think Roy

269
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:04,990
was it she's rather lacking in momentum

270
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,450
himself I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we will it didn't only</font>

271
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,910
seem to affect Pink Floyd you know that

272
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,190
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have this vision I guess of</font>

273
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:16,330
me being in and out all the time in and

274
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:20,259
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out in and out he spent quite</font>

275
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:22,629
a lot of time in the studio with us very

276
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive recording time that you spend</font>

277
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,890
just in our control room chattering and

278
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:32,620
anyway I digress roger was really

279
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,720
struggling with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then Dave then</font>

280
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,549
they both tried there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

281
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,019
arguing about how we were going to do it

282
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,480
and how we were going to make it work

283
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the one point Roy who was in the</font>

284
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,900
room pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> gun sit I just said I'll do it</font>

285
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:49,479
if you feel like for a price deep

286
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:55,330
respect and I mean that most sense silly

287
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:58,269
I mean Roy really plays hard I mean I

288
00:19:55,329 --> 00:20:02,289
can I can picture it now which was pink

289
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:04,900
put this on something to her as if his

290
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:08,109
life depended on it you gotta get an

291
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,080
album at you owe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people we're</font>

292
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:13,709
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy we can hardly count I mean</font>

293
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,710
lyrics

294
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,680
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have written those lyrics I'd feel</font>

295
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:24,049
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleased and did we tell you the</font>

296
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:26,509
name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game boy we call it right in</font>

297
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,369
the gravy train

298
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:31,700
played millions of times around the

299
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:36,019
world as a single that was my vocals on

300
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:39,529
a you know really it kind of a number

301
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:43,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">one selling single everybody thought it</font>

302
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:45,920
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roger okay I was with peed off about</font>

303
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,619
her I think if I'd sang it would be more

304
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,509
vulnerable and less cynical than the way

305
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:54,799
he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

306
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:57,440
the way Roy sings he went off and did it

307
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,609
and did a great job and thank you very

308
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">much I don't think Roger liked his</font>

309
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:05,929
version terribly much but i think is his

310
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:11,390
version is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect version he was</font>

311
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:15,500
singing a sort of parody anyway and wish

312
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:19,160
I don't like I never liked it the worst

313
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:22,579
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that one sometimes when I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing you know when i'm doing a gig</font>

315
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:31,129

316
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,240
girl you know I regret it and then

317
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because I've got anything</font>

318
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:40,579
against Roy I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and then</font>

319
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:43,420
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'd persevered with it I</font>

320
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have done it better</font>

321
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,259
you're not gonna die

322
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:11,240
I was so unbelievably thrilled to be

323
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,670
this and I was just very young as I was

324
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,009
just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually a rather</font>

325
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,870
nice picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that nick mason took</font>

326
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:21,710
and sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sums up because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just look</font>

327
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:24,229
wide-eyed and you know thrilled as the

328
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">only words I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Todd Bates and fairy</font>

329
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,460
cakes and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been quite as a</font>

330
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:31,129
pregnant of the studio there's this

331
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,610
wonderful sequence of of Roger proving

332
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,040
that he did enjoy the cake I think that

333
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:40,099
that Nick took these pictures because i

334
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,409
can't imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the courage to</font>

335
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:48,500
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know take them a bratz I did</font>

336
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:49,970
Roger is in the driving seat in these

337
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,309
pictures as far as the studio's

338
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,740
concerned and perhaps that position is

339
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:57,379
is hard but actually it's probably

340
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,259
better if just one person's and driving

341
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,020
seat Roger actually you know kept a

342
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:06,019
tight hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the helm and that's what</font>

343
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,789
what he does what he did and you know

344
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't gain say that because the</font>

345
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:12,879
record you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> records were very</font>

346
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
good

347
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:25,820
dog side which is such a sort of see all

348
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,690
the pieces fell into place so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick</font>

349
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:32,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mason says drumming did it so I think</font>

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was quite hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with what</font>

351

do you do makes what do you do to top it

352
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,930
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be different I</font>

353
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:45,230
couldn't draw so fantasy pictures were

354
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,690
out I couldn't pain so artsy fartsy

355
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:51,170
without I wasn't the graphic designer

356
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not interested in band</font>

357
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">pictures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I didn't really I</font>

358
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,080
didn't found them bit dull you know a

359
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:59,960
group of four musicians to play guitar

360
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:02,449
drums and bass or keyboards would seem

361
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,029
to me to be four musicians<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced it</font>

362
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:08,120
could be anybody we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt that</font>

363
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,279
representing the mood the music was the

364
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:13,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">order of the day I know it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds</font>

365
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,950
radical even revolutionary so in order

366
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,539
to represent the music one didn't really

367
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,990
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be limited in the great palette</font>

368
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:26,420
of art and life to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pitcher for geezers</font>

369
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:28,730
we mostly in those days left it to storm

370
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,710
to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things which we would</font>

371
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:36,769
give him a<font color="#CCCCCC"> diss sultry to miss of our</font>

372
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,980
mixing time to say that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that</font>

374
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,269
at abbey road and I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> going there</font>

375
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:47,930
and I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very I was very</font>

376
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:50,839
nervous in doing a presentation he came

377
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:53,420
up with these this you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

378
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:56,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">lyrics from this theme of absence and it</font>

379
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,730
just seemed like a very very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

380
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:00,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I remember getting a little round of</font>

381
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,529
applause that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a most gratified i can</font>

382
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:05,119
tell you storm actually is probably one

383
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:08,599
of the most argumentative people you

384
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,329
could ever meet Roger and storm it has

385
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:14,569
these intense conversations over fine

386
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:17,000
wines and so on storm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roger with two</font>

387
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:20,299
great intellects and you know there's

388
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,940
there's sparks flying in in in their

389
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,669
brains that is too I got very

390
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,570
preoccupied with<font color="#E5E5E5"> four with a number for</font>

391
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:31,480
the fall words in the title for members

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the band and four elements</font>

first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was tough as a postcard</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the post-grad said wish you were here ho</font>

396
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,700
found his fantastic location called late

<font color="#CCCCCC">mono which is such an amazing location</font>

398
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,980
that you could just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about photograph and</font>

399

plastic duck and you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we always</font>

loving to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most expensive</font>

402
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,779
distant location in the world so he

403
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:02,319
could go offerin and have a little jolly

404
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:04,660
for a few days<font color="#CCCCCC"> as our expense this guy's</font>

doing a yoga position in a yoga chair

406
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,220
locked into the mud poor man with a

407
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,750
breathing apparatus on and he had to

408
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,730
hold his breath shouting in the bubbles

409
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,410
that's all shop for real that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

airbrush no cutting or anything and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

411
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:20,230
was a moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in time on a magical</font>

00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:22,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">evening with amazing light did that take</font>

413
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,809
a long time to set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of a fucking</font>

414
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,990
long time this shot was a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

415
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,990
ass

416
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,970
I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the notice of Pink Floyd</font>

417
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,059
because I made a film in Los Angeles for

418
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,370
the BBC I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would do a kind</font>

419
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:59,730
of a visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> diary of Americana at that</font>

420
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:01,379
time so I drew everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to</font>

421
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:08,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of at the time like black power</font>

422
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:11,790
playboy magazine Mickey Mouse it's

423
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,559
fantastic Mickey Mouse secret when the

424
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:16,819
key goes from being the mouse to being a

425
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,819
sort of drug-crazed mouse

426
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:35,000
Amy yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> far out making such a clean</font>

427
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:36,979
living and there he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> on drugs I told</font>

428
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,640
it was absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant and I just</font>

429
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought this we could really be great to</font>

430
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,170
work with someone who produced something

431
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,450
like this and I took it to Roger and

432
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,789
show garage Aaron Rodgers loved it I

433
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,680
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a very was very awkward</font>

434
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:53,420
like all relationships at the beginning

435
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,039
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted one thing from me</font>

436
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,050
and I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up with the goods I</font>

437
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,659
felt when I say this to Roger these days

438
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:01,849
he said oh I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that I just</font>

439
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was an enormous relief after</font>

440
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:06,980
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flailing around visually</font>

441
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:11,840
that we're done with dark side of the

442
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:17,049
moon I think the Sandman is a

443
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,049
particularly great image

444
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,660
you know the fact that we're all mr. Sam

445
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,100
that can blow away i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just an</font>

446
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:28,830
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had really I wanted to do the</font>

447
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:32,369
impermanence of life who are you know

448
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:34,609
it's all sounds rather pretentious crap

449
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:34,609
really

450
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,950
you

451
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:58,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of the record sounds very</font>

452
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:03,509
melancholy and is very melancholy and

453
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:05,579
his melancholy music sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> blues and</font>

454
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:08,900
it's a sort of G minor blues that whole

455
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,899
first six or seven minutes

456
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:19,159
we obviously found a mood that we wanted

457
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:22,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">to not exactly jam to but play around</font>

458
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,899
with them and find something<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

459
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:29,740
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> never too afraid of leaving</font>

460
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:33,509
quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> period of time instrumental</font>

461
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">before locals came in</font>

462
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:04,898
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the time it was a case of let's see</font>

463
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,899
what works

464
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:11,380
so then hence<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wine grass tape came</font>

465
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,380
out

466
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:20,288
the wine glasses were recorded for an

467
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:23,798
album<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to make called</font>

468
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:28,808
household objects which we had on a loop

469
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:33,329
and then Rick then built up sound with

470
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:33,329
synthesizers and Morgan

471
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:47,529
they've wanted a big sound so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guitar</font>

472
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:52,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">was recorded in a different studio so</font>

473
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:55,359
hence the creek track he put his

474
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,559
amplifiers and speakers down in studio

475
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:03,879
one being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a classical music studio and</font>

476
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:10,269
then marked it from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> distance I think</font>

477
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:12,370
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes across on the album you could</font>

478
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,639
picture it being played out somewhere in

479
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,639
an auditorium

480
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:26,769
this will be Rick featured on the end of

481
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:29,159
shine on where he really came into his

482
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,159
element

483
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:40,720
hammond organ on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you had grand</font>

484
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:43,528
piano plus the other synthesized

485
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,528
intimacy plays

486
00:31:48,920 --> 00:32:06,490
I remember exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what synthesizer that</font>

487
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:06,489
was but this is Richards trademark

488
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:13,209
he's a great piano player

489
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:22,870
does highlight is passable training I

490
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:25,449
think if he had another 20 minutes he

491
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:29,278
would've heard probably like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> required</font>

492
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,278
concerto

493
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:38,389
at the very end where he does the

494
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:43,309
tribute to syd barrett<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

495
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:45,770
if that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rick thinking of that</font>

496
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:51,670
at the spur of them over on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a moment</font>

497
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:51,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a nice nice touching thing</font>

498
00:32:54,289 --> 00:33:05,119
he was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a crazy diamond and all</font>

499
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:08,809
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says about him those</font>

500
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:12,889
brilliant lines are very very accurate

501
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:14,809
you know you were out<font color="#CCCCCC"> your welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

502
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,020
random precision was certainly a part of

503
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:17,019
him

504
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:29,340
please

505
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,340
go

506
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,549
you

507
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:49,000
my memory is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were recording a</font>

508
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:53,140
radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 show at the BBC and Sid didn't</font>

509
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,450
turn up I think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Friday and no</font>

510
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,850
one could find him so we've basically

511
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,799
waited and waited and I think we had to

512
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:02,049
cancel recording or we tried to do some

513
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:05,230
without him not sure and then the

514
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,149
managers went off trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find him and</font>

515
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:11,110
when they found Sid which I think was a

516
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:14,200
Sunday or Monday they told us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font>

517
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,909
if something's happened to sit and

518
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,980
something had happened to total

519
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,559
difference and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember if he was</font>

520
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:24,490
being right like this and looking in his

521
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:28,860
eyes I was just like somebody turned the

522
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:28,859
lights out it just looked so bad

523
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,019
he was living with a whole sort of

524
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,260
community of people who were very much

525
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:39,989
believing acid can release him you know

526
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:46,200
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the truth and all that stuff and</font>

527
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:50,878
he took too much and he went up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

528
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:53,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">stage and he just stood there for long</font>

529
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:56,190
stretches and<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing the guitar for bed</font>

530
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then stopped he had done so much</font>

531
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,579
damage because I said that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

532
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,570
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you too much acid would</font>

533
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:05,079
literally fry your brains

534
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,080
No

535
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,489
honey

536
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,490
ha

537
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:28,429
we were unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help sit and probably</font>

538
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:31,160
I won't say deliberately but had our own

539
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:35,539
interests<font color="#E5E5E5"> at heart and so consequently</font>

540
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:38,868
probably tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hold on to him for far</font>

541
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:42,349
longer than we should have done Sid left

542
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:44,660
the band in 1968 Sid Sid was only around

543
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:47,779
for that one record it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a tiny piece</font>

544
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:49,699
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a very important piece it was</font>

545
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,640
the opening piece of the Pink Floyd

546
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:54,469
story and it may well<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that pink floyd</font>

547
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,879
would never have started and would have

548
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:58,459
never carried on and nothing would have

549
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,599
happened we will never know he was a

550
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:07,550
real hindrance to to the band in in many

551
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:09,889
ways having said that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply wouldn't</font>

552
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,900
have got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we got to would be no</font>

553
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:15,079
Dark Side of the Moon if Sid hadn't been

554
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,530
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to take us on that first major</font>

555
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,529
step

556
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:36,350
I prize so upsetting working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sid in</font>

557
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,970
those days we was like trying to seeing

558
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:39,920
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so drowning and trying to pull</font>

559
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:42,500
them out but they were kept on slip you

560
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,480
know the hand slipped away all the time

561
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,670
you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping that would be</font>

562
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,030
therapeutic for him and might help<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

563
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:53,680
come back trying it was like trying to

564
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">tip to paint that combats</font>

565
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:11,279
it was never likely to be any way back

566
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:11,279
and that is quite awful to think about

567
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:39,929
you reach for the secret too soon

568
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:48,610
you cry to the blue

569
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,610
yeah it all

570
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:56,449
and of course they love their room so we

571
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,950
just who the same shadow you crazy that

572
00:37:56,449 --> 00:38:03,019
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just read the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the way</font>

573
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:06,469
they love doing Colleen and Vanessa

574
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:08,690
being Americans and soulful was a

575
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:13,189
wonderful contrast between the such

576
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:15,530
appreciation<font color="#E5E5E5"> assist Pink Floyd I didn't</font>

577
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,539
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from Aurora soul and I didn't</font>

578
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:20,120
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> their music in the beginning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

579
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:23,509
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minor key is all very low and</font>

580
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:27,109
everything was losing us who are these

581
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:29,540
people I thought Motown was meticulous

582
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:32,329
but this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most meticulous for</font>

583
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:35,449
musicians that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen work</font>

584
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:38,690
before and something told me in my head

585
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:41,210
banana you're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a reason you have</font>

586
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:43,820
must enjoy this music you must get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

587
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this music cuz you're here there's</font>

588
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">something for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to learn they manage</font>

589
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:53,329
to do their job without getting involved

590
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,130
in the band politics so yeah those two

591
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:58,369
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at just that you know if we</font>

592
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,960
might be in furious with each other

593
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,269
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something or other and having some</font>

594
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,710
great were our the dinner table or in

595
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:06,019
the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the weight of the show</font>

596
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:08,480
whatever and they'd just be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

597
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:11,360
relaxed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just get on with it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

598
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,119
always sang beautifully one of my

599
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,640
father's fondest memories of<font color="#CCCCCC"> being with</font>

600
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,039
Pink Floyd recording shine on you crazy

601
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,190
diamond because that was the only thing

602
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,679
that we got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually record with them</font>

603
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,030
as opposed to singing performing dark

604
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,469
side of the moon so that was a great

605
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about it we actually got on a</font>

606
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:30,069
record

607
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:49,349
so welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine they just</font>

608
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,660
wanted bits of add hot animation bummed

609
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,339
into the show willy-nilly and of course

610
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:57,329
I had my little team of animators who

611
00:39:53,340 --> 00:40:00,150
are strictly trained to work to a track

612
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:02,429
and without a track they don't know what

613
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do I used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and tell Roger this</font>

614
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:10,349
doesn't matter about a track<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let</font>

615
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:13,139
them do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I assume he made that</font>

616
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:17,069
all that spherical stuff having heard

617
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:22,469
the VCS three throbbing at the beginning

618
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:31,559
of welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine all that stuff</font>

619
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:36,569
when it came to welcome to the machine I

620
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:40,320
think Roger Rudy getting into his

621
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:42,510
synthesizers so hence you have all these

622
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:49,410
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects</font>

623
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:51,670
I mean some of these noises to me just

624
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:57,308
futuristic

625
00:40:51,670 --> 00:41:01,420
I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> that machine I used to a lot back</font>

626
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the day still got one it's still good</font>

627
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:12,940
for wind and explosions see in the throb

628
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:19,210
is basically what Roger would have

629
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:26,980
played on base he adds to it later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

630
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:30,010
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real base really realism is</font>

631
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,699
really on there are Dave's acoustics

632
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,700
good

633
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:51,509
you add a bit more to the aggression of

634
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:51,509
song the tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> and symbols are added</font>

635
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:02,280
it just sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very angry song to</font>

637
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,690
was getting something artists

638
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,640
I do

639
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:32,859
way

640
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:35,770
this particular creature<font color="#E5E5E5"> I created I</font>

641
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,570
remember showing it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gang we sort</font>

642
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,949
of went along with everything as I said

643
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,280
at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point they didn't sort of</font>

644
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:45,099
correct anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roger it particularly</font>

645
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">has this idea that if you hire an artist</font>

646
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:50,049
you don't try and change what the artist

647
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:53,349
does you hire an<font color="#E5E5E5"> officer for what he</font>

648
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:58,330
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> cherry has a very similar kind of a</font>

bolshie attitude towards all status quo

650
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:02,789
and all the powers to be the item

651
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:13,150
d

652
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:16,629
see you blood that comes to gorgeous and

653
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:18,789
crashes super to steel towers goodness

654
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">what it's about but and so that I</font>

655
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:24,309
thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very kind of a strong</font>

656
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:27,730
image a seal blood I did really add

657
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:30,670
piece by piece the animation so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

658
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:34,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">dropped down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sea of blood Roger</font>

659
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,650
probably said we need it a bit longer

660
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:42,500
so then the sea of blood had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn</font>

661
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,950
into hands praying grasping hands

662
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,858
hopeless lost kind of hands I suppose

663
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:51,098
searching for some God or some<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to</font>

664
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:51,098
it all

665
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,539
you could say that welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

666
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:01,140
machine is only about my experience in

667
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:04,829
the music industry it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our experience in the face of</font>

669
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:12,619
that monstrous grinding thing that

670
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:12,618
chooses up and spits us out

671
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,730
in the meetings that stall<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had you</font>

672
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:25,009
know one of the topics were suddenly

673
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,230
getting burnt in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business you know</font>

674
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:30,470
which was an expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time man</font>

675
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:35,150
have been burned you know so what more

676
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:37,639
logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> magritte concept if you like</font>

677
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,349
would be then two men shaking hands and

678
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:42,230
one of them is getting burned we both

679
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:45,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">had yeah mostly cuz it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so outrageous</font>

680
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,400
these are the days before computers

681
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,199
though it meant sitting around on fire

682
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,119
which we did yeah it wasn't very

683
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:52,069
difficult it's hit issuing orders from

684
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bunker it's really easy over the top</font>

685
00:44:52,070 --> 00:45:03,620
men anyway that was done<font color="#E5E5E5"> for real in a</font>

686
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:07,809
studio lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> holy what could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

689
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:18,019
betche doing a lot of firework in those

690

days and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had the special suits and all</font>

691
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:24,019
this stuff for full enveloped fire but a

692
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:29,059
partial is basically you know pretty

693
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:32,869
safe pretty easy one to do and in most

694
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:35,570
cases he had a team<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 20 people rounded</font>

695
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:37,639
with five distinguishes and ready to and

696
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,920
I deal with any emergency the effects

697
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:42,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">mantels step out and he's got a wand</font>

698
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,500
about that long with a fire on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

699
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:47,509
of it and they go we're ready action and

700
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,090
he just touches the three or four spots

701
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:53,150
like that steps out everything's burning

702
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:58,130
and it's a still picture so shake

703
00:45:53,150 --> 00:46:01,670
shaking hands nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and after</font>

704
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:03,230
I'd shot about I suppose 15 shots I'm 15

705
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:07,250
times for somebody to catch fires rather

706
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:09,349
a lot suddenly just a breeze and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Far</font>

707
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">whip-round his face there was a funny</font>

708
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:13,369
thing about fire when it gets in your

709
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,440
face you're going to move it's just

710
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:18,170
that's just part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and once</font>

711
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,990
it blew<font color="#CCCCCC"> it around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I turned as fast as I</font>

712
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:23,510
could he fell<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground absolutely</font>

713
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:24,769
smothered with foam and blankets and

714
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,680
everything like that and he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

715
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:30,230
he said that's it no more I'm luckily I

716
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,119
got it McCann from here we see him his

717
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,010
foot leaving frame I mean it's a sort of

718
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:36,650
rather surreal teammates<font color="#E5E5E5"> of absence in</font>

719
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:39,530
itself you know but that's real absence

720
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:41,450
out of frame how to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

721
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">just kept shooting I just kept shooting</font>

722
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:45,829
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I had to get this shot and</font>

723
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:48,259
had to be right so you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

724
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:50,900
time to be concerned with this

725
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,370
since fuzzy you know if they want

726
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,380
somebody burning and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

727
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay me I don't care if they have an</font>

728
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,750
artist drawing the fuck

729
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:09,568
when developing a theme of absence it

730
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:13,829
seemed therefore appropriate enemy and

731
00:47:09,568 --> 00:47:18,748
the cover to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> absent the got it here</font>

732
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:21,028
<font color="#CCCCCC">DM this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end piece the end or the</font>

733
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:22,828

what it was otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact he</font>

00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:56,110
slit the opaque vinyl shrink wrapper and

extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> the record and actually haven't</font>

747
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:03,300
seen the cover in 35 years brilliant

748
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:03,300
that's really absolutely

749
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:23,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one I can remember my clearly</font>

750
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:25,599
it's that was me strumming a 12-string

751
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:28,750
guitar which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd recently purchased from</font>

752
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,150
a guy I know and coming up with their

753
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,909
unit the opening<font color="#E5E5E5"> riff of wish you were</font>

754
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:37,079
here

755
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:38,699
and again like like the four notes at

756
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the beginning of shine on you crazy done</font>

757
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:42,989

00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:57,150
playing that's really nice any-any

761
00:48:53,369 --> 00:49:00,329
played it and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

762
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:04,139
maybe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do something with</font>

763
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:07,409
it I think Roger and I then worked on

764
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:10,319
writing the verses and putting those

765
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:14,819
courts into the into the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and</font>

766
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:18,450
Roger did those brilliant words and

767
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:20,059
there we are did they get you to try

768
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:22,328

shame walk-on part in the wall

773
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,039
for lead role

774
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:57,909
that collaboration between David and I i

775
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:00,579
think is you know really good all bits

you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on as part of it or not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

791
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:07,380
if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stand on square one until</font>

792
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,909
you die and I know this that it made

793
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,440
that may sound like bullshit but that's

794
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:18,460
what that's what the song is about

795
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,460
I wish you were here

796
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:28,349
which is to love so swimming in a fish

797
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:35,830
bowl year after you running over the

798
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:38,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">same old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ground the same fear</font>

799
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:43,039
wish you

800
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:46,400
all the songs are encouraging me I guess

801
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:53,570
I write them for me and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

802
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:58,309
encourage myself not to accept a lead

803
00:51:53,570 --> 00:52:03,860
role in a cage but to go on demanding of

804
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:06,860
myself that I keep auditioning for the

805
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,829
walk-on part in the war because that's

806
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,900
where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be I want to be in the</font>

807
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,460
trenches I don't want to be at

808
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,460
headquarters or i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

809
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:21,338
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting in a hotel somewhere I want to</font>

810
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:26,528
be I want to be engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

811
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:29,608
probably i might say in a way that my

812
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:29,608
father would approve<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

813
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:43,279
it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple sort of country song</font>

814
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:47,420
it's still because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its resonance and</font>

815
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:51,940
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> the emotional weight it carries it</font>

816
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,940
is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our best songs</font>

817
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,730
Oh

818
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,318
people do attached to lots of internal

819
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:02,019
feelings that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they may have and they may</font>

820
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:04,329
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be entirely sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's about and</font>

821
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:08,380
neither am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I'm only telling you</font>

822
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:10,359
what it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me and but there's</font>

823
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,608
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why other people shouldn't put</font>

824
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:16,500
other interpretations on it which which

825
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:16,500
could be just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as valid</font>

826
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:23,529
although shine on you crazy diamond is

827
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,539
the one that is specifically about

828
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:30,460
certain wish you were here has a broader

829
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:32,909
remit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't sing it without thinking</font>

830
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it</font>

831
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:51,868
my memory is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came into the studio</font>

832
00:53:48,389 --> 00:53:54,480
and there was this guy standing there in

833
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:58,349
a gabardine raincoat and large large

834
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,630
bloke and I had no idea who it was and

835
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:02,609
surprisingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's saying who's that</font>

836
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:07,170
person what's he doing wandering<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

837
00:54:02,608 --> 00:54:08,518
all our gear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the studio and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then then</font>

838
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:12,480
him coming into the control room

839
00:54:08,518 --> 00:54:15,268
standing around and how remarkable how

840
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,269
long it was before anyone actually woke

841
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:25,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">up finally I think it was David who said</font>

842
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:27,838
necting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> recognized him and I looked</font>

843
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:30,568
and I think I either shrug my shoulders

844
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:34,949
or what at some point Dave so put me out

845
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to my misery and said it said we just</font>

846
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:40,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">stood there or sat on just a shell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shock</font>

847
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,429
basically

848
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,150
and then tow somebody thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

849
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:45,149
something to say to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

850
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:52,509
and then we were all unbelievably

851
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:54,960
shocked victim his<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearance I mean I</font>

852
00:54:52,509 --> 00:55:00,869
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize and there was him</font>

853
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:05,250
but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty pretty affecting</font>

854
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:11,969
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean version Dave cried yeah</font>

855
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:14,099
this slim elegant if bedraggled<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

856
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:17,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">dazed person that I'd last seen had</font>

857
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:22,250
turned rather balloon shaped and no

858
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,250
eyebrows not much hair

859
00:55:30,778 --> 00:55:34,550
there is the photograph of him in the

860
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:38,150
studio at the turret

861
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:43,870
you if you looked at sitting the early

862
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:43,869
67 said then it was so different

863
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:54,250
he was a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss am and you know the</font>

864
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:58,119
imagining what he would have gone on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

865
00:55:54,250 --> 00:56:03,719
do is speculating on that if you like is

866
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:03,720
his he could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have become so great</font>

867
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Oh

868
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,059
Oh

869
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,829
those years

870
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the rest of you</font>

871
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:05,059

00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:18,160
to me it's about the most complete album

875
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:21,640
in some ways and we all know how

876
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that point</font>

877
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:26,519
and the problems we had

878
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,099
you

879
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:36,739
it's full<font color="#E5E5E5"> of grief but and anger but</font>

880
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:39,768
also full of love you've got to see

881
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:44,230
beyond the grief and anger and to the

882
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:44,229
possibilities of of love

883
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,559
you

884
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:14,699

00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:10,650

888
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,329
