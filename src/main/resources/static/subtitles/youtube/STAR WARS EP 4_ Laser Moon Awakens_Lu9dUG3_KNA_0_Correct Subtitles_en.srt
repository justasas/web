00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,359
Previously on Star Fight

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,000
Surprise bitches!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Far2D2, your highness

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,219
You told me there's a bar here

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,330
Yeah, my bad

6
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,140
You shouldn't fart in an elevator, Master.

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,500
Hello, sexy.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,329
Fresh.

9
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,500
I hate the friend zone!

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,000
The greatest achievement in the universe!

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,600
The Singularity Engine!

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm pregnant. (Laughs) It's Obi's!

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My midichlorian count is at nine right now.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay good. Let's get you clean!

15
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,899
She friend zoneded me!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
You have done that to yourself.

17
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,500
You are such and ass. Hole!

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,500
Yeeaaaaahhhh boyyeeeee!

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first moon sized entertainment and laser tag facility!

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,900
Wow.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

22
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:08,599
What the fu...

23
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,599
Stop your vehicle and silence all audio systems.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,900
You are in a designated Imperion Family Fun Zone.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your activities are NOTAPPROVED!

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
(Screaming)

27
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,000
What's happening?!

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't ask me!

29
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,539
How could you be so calm while this place falls apart around us?

30
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,500
I envy your resolve, Far2.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,990
Look at you.

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,000
Cool as a cucumber!

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,000
You actually look sort of like a cucumber, Far2.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,000
What is this place? It seems oddly
familiar.

35
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you mean we've been here nineteen years?!

36
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,000
That's preposterous! Who would believe that?!

37
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,200
Alright guys, open up!

38
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,500
I know you're in there. I can smell the refer from here.

39
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,899
You know the deal: No unauthorized party vessels in designated family fun zones!

40
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,900
You're forcing my hand here, now I've got to shut you down!

41
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:27,000
Open up!

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,900
Forget it, we're going to break the
door down,

43
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,900
so just, everybody get to a safe distance.

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,500
Far2?

45
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,300
Did you ditch me?

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,970
Aw man! What happened here?!

47
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,699
Sir. The blast knocked a few people out again.

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,699
Yeah, I can see that.

49
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,900
We'll call for a space ambulance.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
(Sighing)

51
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,000
God dammit, when is this day going to be over?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Hey, we're over Tatooine, right?

53
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,900
You know my brother Owen lives down there, we should stop by. Say hello.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Stop, like, for a visit?

55
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,500
Yeah, just pop in for a second.

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You know his birthday's coming up, I think that'd be a fun surprise!

57
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,789
Aw, I can't wait to see the look on his face!

58
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,169
What do you think...Unfortunately sir were
little behind schedule and we need to keep moving.

59
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,899
Uhh...okay?

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,160
I could arrange for a fruit
basket.

61
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,500
Fruit basket?

62
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:29,500
Really?!

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,300
That's not too impersonal?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,199
Yeah, you know what? Send it. Very good sir.

65
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,199
Far2!

66
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,930
You shouldn't run off like that! You know I
don't like large crowds.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,149
You're the icebreaker and apparently,

68
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,550
I'm suffering from crippling amnesia. It's not safe to leave me alone!

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,050
Sir.

70
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,800
What?

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,300
Sir.

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,800
Yes, what.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Sir. Yes, what is it?

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,300
Sir.

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,800
What?

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Sir.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,300
What?

78
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,800
Sir!

79
00:04:59,019 --> 00:04:59,519
Sir.

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,000
Somebody! Sir. What.

81
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:02,199
Sir. What?!

82
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,500
What is wrong with you?

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,100
Sir.

84
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,900
Answer me!

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,699
Nothing to report, sir (laughing)

86
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,699
Screw you guys!

87
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:12,000
Hey! What are you doing over there?!

88
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,000
Stop that!

89
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,299
What do you mean "we're leaving"?

90
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not getting in there with you! That's stealing!

91
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,680
Far2, you're scaring me.

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,000
When did you become such a hooligan?!

93
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,599
Alright, alright, I'm coming.

94
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,000
Just don't hurt me.

95
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,000
What do you think about Jim's coleslaw?

96
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,000
Homemade or store-bought?

97
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,379
Maybe you're right.

98
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,999
Nineteen years is a long time to be in
one place.

99
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,000
I think I could use a change of scenery!

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
Man, he is NOT going to be happy about this.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Not half.

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
Sir, we found your...uhh...

103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
Well well well, missy.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,500
I can't wait to hear you talk your way out of this one.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,500
You know what? Save it!

106
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,699
I paid good money to send you to space
college.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,000
You're supposed to be out here learning something not hanging around with a bunch of losers.

108
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
You know this is going to kill your mother.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,610
When did you become such a jerk?!

110
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,000
You don't talk to me like that you're
grounded, Leia!

111
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,000
Take her back to Laser Moon, I'll deal with her later!

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,300
God dammit!

113
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,900
Oh good!

114
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,769
A desert planet!

115
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,779
Completely devoid of life! It's perfect, Far2.

116
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,199
I love it!

117
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,199
In a galaxy teeming with advanced civilizations, why would we pick anything else?

118
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,300
We have everything we need here, Far2.

119
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,000
All this sand and bones!

120
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,500
Here, let's see what's over this dune.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Oh look! Sand.

122
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,330
We are limited only by our imaginations!

123
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,389
Wait, where are you going? Isn't this what you wanted?

124
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,909
Sand and bones, as far as the eye can
see?

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Hey, slow down.

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,100
Far2, I am at a loss.

127
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,629
I'm having trouble remembering anything, let alone the last 19 years.

128
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:32,000
What is it you're not telling me?

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,740
Did you bring us here for a reason?

130
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,600
Or did you just do it to torment me?!

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
I have had it with you!

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Get the hell out of my sight!

133
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,199
I don't ever want to see you again.

134
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,099
Oh Far2 wait, I almost forgot!

135
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Suck it!

136
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,000
One, two, buckle my shoe.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Three, four...

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Wait.

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,000
What happened to my shoes?!

140
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh no!

141
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,000
Did I leave them behind somewhere?

142
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,300
Why would I even go outside without shoes? Ugh, I'm so confused.

143
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,800
Hey, what am I doing here?

144
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,899
This place seems dangerous.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,500
I'm definitely going to need some new shoes.

146
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
What's that?

147
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,000
Is that a...a tiny shoe,

148
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,399
lying inches from my grasp?

149
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
Or a...mega shoe,

150
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,500
the size of a house miles away for me?!

151
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Shoooooeeesss!

152
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,099
Man, the dollar to acre ratio must be insane out here!

153
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:34,399
Dude, who cares? Let's just deliver this fruit basket.

154
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,129
Oi, Bill.

155
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,200
Check this out. Does this look like a midichlorian injector ring to you?

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,700
Uh oh.

157
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm telling you, the absence of the Jedi has made a soft.

158
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,100
Perhaps you are too young to remember. They're more dangerous than you realize.

159
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,240
You'd be a fool

160
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,700
if you believe the Jedi aren't all a bunch of pathetic has-beens.

161
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Well those has beens, as you say, were totally responsible for a galaxy wide insurance collapse!

162
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,620
Regional manager Vader should have taken care of this a long time ago!

163
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,169
You know if you've got something to say
to me why don't you say to my face?

164
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:20,909
Instead of pretending like I'm not standing, right here.

165
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah that's what I thought.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Look, you want to find a Jedi?

167
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,500
Just send a guy into every bar in the
galaxy

168
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,899
and I guarantee you'll find one eventually.

169
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,129
We don't have the manpower
for an operation of that scale!

170
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,350
Really? Cause I was being serious.

171
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,430
And you're also very good at detecting
sarcasm.

172
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:40,399
And your job.

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,399
...and satisfying your wife.

174
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,879
I don't have to sit here and take flak from some clown in a cape!

175
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,700
You have no power here, regional manager.

176
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:56,000
(Bickering)

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Enough. This bickering is
pointless.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,100
We already have men in the area,
delivering fruit, apparently.

179
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,099
It can't hurt to ask around.

180
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,009
So it turns out

181
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,470
it wasn't a shoe at all! Isn't that ridiculous?

182
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,649
(Laughs) A giant shoe. Anyways,

183
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,149
what's your name?

184
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,149
Oh, these guys.

185
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:30,088
They're the best. I don't understand they seem but they seem really nice.

186
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,100
I think they're going to give us new shoes.

187
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,129
Yes, hello. I'll take two shoes,

188
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:43,000
and three for my friend.

189
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,509
Two plus three is five. Five shoes,

190
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,000
por favor.

191
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,000
Alright then, what's your name?

192
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Funny you should ask, I have no idea.

193
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
First time on Tatooine?

194
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:08,289
I think so. I like it so far. Friendly
people.

195
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,000
What's your opinion on the singularity?

196
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Umm...to be quite honest I don't know what
that means. Can we still be friends?

197
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,500
I promise to learn everything I can
about the singu...

198
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Alright, shut up. We'll take this one.

199
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:21,500
Duke.

200
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:26,600
Take this one over to the garage, will ya. I want him cleaned up before dinner.

201
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,729
But I was going to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.

202
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,100
Nobody likes a whiner, Duke. Un-tuck it. Act like a man.

203
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Alright. Come on.

204
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
You too, blue.

205
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,440
Far2, this is our new friend, Duke.

206
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,230
He enjoys Tosche Station, and his father likes to embarrass him in public.

207
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,590
He's not my father.

208
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, I don't like the way he treats you. Right, Far2?

209
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,299
You seem a little old to be playing with toys, Duke.

210
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,319
Not that there's anything wrong with
that!

211
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,279
I don't know, there just nothing to do around here.

212
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,629
It's just all sand and bones.

213
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,519
Listen, Duke. I can't quite explain it, but...

214
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,039
I have a good feeling about you. We
should be best friends!

215
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,120
You can call me Friend Besto!

216
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:24,830
How's that sound?

217
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,360
Sounds good.

218
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,559
Wait, what are you doing with Far2?

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,340
Can I help?

220
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,039
Yeah!

221
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,019
Let's take him apart and see if we can put him back together!

222
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,299
What a fun project!

223
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,320
Hope you can keep up!

224
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,139
Later!

225
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,659
I work hard, and I play hard, so I hope you can keep up!

226
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,519
Who is she? She's beautiful.

227
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:49,699
Later!

228
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,960
I work hard, and I play hard, so I hope you can keep up!

229
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,159
Later!

230
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,170
Wait a minute where'd she go, bring her back! Make her naked!

231
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:04,870
You heard him, Far2! Duke wants nudies!

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,059
Duke! Food!

233
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,659
I'll be right there in a minute.

234
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,200
Ah, I gotta go eat din-din.

235
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,420
Why don't you guys just hang out, I'll be back in a little bit.

236
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,709
Oh, okay!

237
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,150
Bye, Duke!

238
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,620
What a good lad.

239
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,960
That Owen fellow has a bad attitude though.

240
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,080
We may have to kill him.

241
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,079
With kindness!

242
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:07,600
Duke!

243
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:09,079
It's space thirty!

244
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,960
Get your ass in here before you burn to death!

245
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,179
(Screams of pain)

246
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,080
What are you doing hiding back there?

247
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:31,220
I was alone shrouded in darkness, and then there was you!

248
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,340
Friend Besto, have you seen Far2?

249
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,620
Far2? Friend Besto?

250
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,190
Yes. I. Am Friend Besto.

251
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,600
Ally of Duke!

252
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,639
I...

253
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,139
am Friend...

254
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,720
Bestoooo!

255
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,539
Hi, Duke!

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,320
Did this Far2 character absquatulate?

257
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,230
Yeah.

258
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,399
Bitch.

259
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,899
He strikes me as a free spirit.

260
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:04,769
Wandering around, leading people from one adventure to the next.

261
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,880
He might as well be named Fart Macguffin 2D2

262
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,659
Yeah.

263
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,620
We'll call him FartMacmuffin for short!

264
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,819
We'll be quite the trio!

265
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,980
Duke, Friend Besto and FartMacmuffin.

266
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,680
Duke!

267
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,019
Are we going to Tasche Station?

268
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,759
No, we don't have time for that right now!

269
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,500
But Duke likes Tasche Station!

270
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,299
Look at this excitable little fellow!

271
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,690
What's your name?

272
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,879
Far2? That's hilarious!

273
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,980
Is that your real name, or some sort
nickname?

274
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,639
You seem like a good lad. Come with us to Tasche Station.

275
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,619
Nah, I'm gonna take a nap.

276
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,180
Oh, okay.

277
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,059
Hello there, Far2.

278
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,569
How did you get in there?

279
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,540
What are you doing here, with Duke?

280
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,180
Ben?

281
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,000
Obi -Wan Ben-Larry Kenobi?

282
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,820
Well actually I'm going by Steve now.

283
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,820
Steve Kenobi.

284
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,460
It's good to see you, Duke. I keep meaning
to hang out with you.

285
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,100
Why don't you guys come back to my place

286
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,859
and have some lemonade.

287
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:05,949
I've got a fresh pitcher with your name on it.

288
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,220
Okay!

289
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:17,349
Lemonade does...

290
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,700
hit the spot...

291
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,319
on a day like today.

292
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,700
Cool and refreshing.

293
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,980
So, Far2.

294
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,980
What have you been doing since the last time I saw you?

295
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,860
What's it been, like, 5...16 years?

296
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,979
Whoa, what's this?

297
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,139
Hi, guys. How's it going?

298
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,000
My name is Leia Skywalker.

299
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,279
I've never used Space Date before, but I'm open to it.

300
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,140
It seems lame, but I'm willing to be proven wrong by the right guy.

301
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,819
I'm a fun and adventurous woman.

302
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:57,079
Currently in my third semester of space college.

303
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,379
My dad is the regional manager of Laser Moon

304
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:01,679
Which is cool!

305
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,799
Sometimes I hang out there on the weekends.

306
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,879
I'm originally from Alderaan,

307
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,660
but I'm not really looking to date anyone from that area.

308
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,640
Alderaan

309
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,819
Alderaan

310
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,400
Alderaan

311
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,860
Alderaan

312
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:26,559
Key code: Alderaan, accepted.

313
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,899
Initializing memory backup.

314
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,680
Alright, I guess that's it.

315
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,220
I work hard and I play hard, so I hope you can keep up!

316
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:35,399
Later!

317
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,480
Do you want to go to Laser Moon?

318
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,599
Maybe we'll find this girl of yours.

319
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,059
Ah, sweet!

320
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,700
Let's head into town and bum a ride.

321
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,219
Hey, you guys mind stopping for a minute and helping us out?

322
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,720
We're looking for possible Jedi in the area.

323
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,719
You guys haven't seen any, have you?

324
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,259
I haven't seen any Jedi.

325
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,880
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

326
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,660
but the reason I stopped you is because you're dressed EXACTLY like a Jedi.

327
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,099
Like...all of them.

328
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,340
Every single one of them dressed exactly the way you're dressed now.

329
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,159
Look, I'm not a Jedi.

330
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,480
Scott, tell me this guy doesn't look like a Jedi.

331
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Yeah yeah, he's got, like, the robes!

332
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,240
Yeah yeah yeah! The robes! Exactly!

333
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,279
Do you see how this looks to us, sir?

334
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,799
Are you telling me you woke up today and accidentally dressed like a Jedi?

335
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:38,759
Yes.

336
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,440
(Laughter)

337
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,039
Hey, you say you're not a Jedi I have to believe you, I mean there's nothing I can do.

338
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,299
If you happen to see one, just find one of us and let us know. Okay?

339
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Alright, take care, guys. You have a nice day.

340
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,000
You have a nice day!

341
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,000
Wow. This place is a den of scumbags!

342
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,840
Oh look, Rat Boy is here.

343
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,329
Good to see him!

344
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,759
Oh, and literally Satan.

345
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,579
That makes sense!

346
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,059
Duke, I'm going to be honest with you.

347
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,559
This place needs to be purified, immediately!

348
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
We don't serve their kind here.

349
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,579
What?!

350
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,519
They're dangerous!

351
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Why don't you wait out by the speeder, we don't want any trouble.

352
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,580
Good idea, Duke!

353
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,160
Less chance of infection.

354
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,720
Hey.

355
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,640
One of those.

356
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,089
(Muffled anger)

357
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,619
Excuse me. He says that you cut him off.

358
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,119
That's extremely rude behavior!

359
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,839
You cut in front of me too, you know!

360
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:00,500
I have been waiting in line for five minutes.

361
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,440
I'll be careful next time.

362
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
You have to wait in line like everyone else!

363
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,148
Well that's not what your mom said last
night...when I stopped by.

364
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,200
I've had it with you, Steve!

365
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,120
Let's go!

366
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:26,148
Han Solo

367
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,688
I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.

368
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
Chewy here tells me you're looking for passage to Laser Moon

369
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,880
Yes indeed.

370
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
Okay. I'll take you, old man.

371
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,680
On one condition.

372
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,460
What's that?

373
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,419
Chewy and I are on the team.

374
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
We're laser tag dominators.

375
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,029
And you're buying the nachos.

376
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:57,970
Whoa!

377
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,980
(Pained human groaning)

378
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,920
(More pain)

379
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,720
Welcome to Laser Moon! Now the ultimate source of entertainment in the universe!

380
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,059
Featuring over 500,000 fine dining choices!

381
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,359
1,000 levels of exclusive shopping!

382
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,379
And of course, 100 kilometers of non-stop, action packed laser tag mayhem!

383
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Fun for every skill level!

384
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,039
Please be sure to have all of your coupons or discount codes ready at the main gate.

385
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,680
Birthday parties and corporate retreats, please proceed to the special events entrance!

386
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,500
Whoa, Han, you look awesome!

387
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,339
I know.

388
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,359
Welcome to game orientation. Your video will begin shortly.

389
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,619
White team leader to Laser Commander, we are in position.

390
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,700
Copy that, white team leader. Proceed to the objective.

391
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,479
Hi, guys. I'm the Laser Commander. Officer in charge of safety...

392
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,420
and fun.

393
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,140
By now you should have already equipped your team uniforms.

394
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,420
Uniforms are color-coded,

395
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:21,220
representing either the white team, or the black team.

396
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,379
If you have not equipped your team uniform,

397
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,620
please find a staff member for assistance.

398
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:29,199
There can be no running at any time
during the match.

399
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,299
Running can cause injury to yourself, or others.

400
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,519
The only way to score IS with your blaster.

401
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:39,659
One-handed gunplay - or "gangsta' grip - is NOT permitted.

402
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,700
Score points by either shooting your opponents or attacking the other teams' base.

403
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,740
There's a maximum score in it for you if
you destroy your opponents' base.

404
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,740
I'll take the base out. You'll just slow me down.

405
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,220
We'll see about that.

406
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,559
What do you say, Chewy, the usual plan?

407
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,690
Far2 and I will stay here and watch
over your possessions.

408
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,269
Stay out of my stuff.

409
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,289
Oh don't worry!

410
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,500
No one cares about your smelly "stuff".

411
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,359
Good luck out there, laser warriors!

412
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,039
And remember: through honor YOU can achieve victory.

413
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,440
You may now proceed to the game zone.

414
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,039
So, Far2!

415
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,480
What shall we do to pass the time?

416
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,419
Oh! Here's a thought!

417
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,279
What do you say we tap into Laser Moon's navigational system and take it for a spin?

418
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,879
I hear Alderaan is quite beautiful this time of year.

419
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,819
The most beautiful thing you've ever seen.

420
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,259
(Laughter)

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,680
When we get into the game zone just follow my lead.

422
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,000
There's going to be a lot of confusion, and we're going to use that to our advantage.

423
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,400
It takes more than good aim to be a laser tag dominator.

424
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,360
Welcome to the winning team, kid.

425
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,120
Uh, hi. We were transferred to black team

426
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,779
And they told us to come here and get our new uniforms.

427
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,920
I wasn't notified

428
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,180
Oh! Ummmm...

429
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,580
Psych!

430
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,960
Get out of the way MIKE!

431
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,420
Alright, let's go, let's go!

432
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,200
Alright here we go, here we go, here we go!

433
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Get through the door, you gotta get through the door!

434
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:55,319
My legs!

435
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm slipping!

436
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:56,819
I'm slipping!

437
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:57,740
My legs won't fit! Shit!

438
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:58,519
Get it together!

439
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,660
Oh no my BELT!

440
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,120
GET IT TOGETHER, MIKE!

441
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,799
White team scores 10,000 points.

442
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,380
Laser Moon is awesome!

443
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,330
Come on! Let's go, kid!

444
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,399
Hold on.

445
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,610
No way!

446
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,159
Are you Leia?

447
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,759
I saw your Space Date profile.

448
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,480
You saw my Space Date profile?

449
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,139
Yeah!

450
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:41,879
I'm Duke Dirtfarmer, I'm here to hang out with you!

451
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:42,899
Duke?

452
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
The Dominators are winning right now. Do you want to be on our team?

453
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,100
Totally!

454
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,299
Awesome, let's go!

455
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,299
Yes.

456
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,049
Sir! Some things have come up that need your immediate attention.

457
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,080
Well, what is it?!

458
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,039
Um, yes. Sir, uh, first:

459
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,980
Complimentary nacho night was more popular than we anticipated,

460
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,240
and our cheese sauce reserves are dangerously low.

461
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,340
You know I told them this would happen.

462
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,180
Alright, what else?

463
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:09,079
Um...

464
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,240
Laser Moon has unexpectedly changed course, and is headed towards Alderaan.

465
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:15,539
And?

466
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,659
And we can't stop it.

467
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,570
(Sigh) Alright, first thing's first...

468
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:21,450
I'm going to get a handle on this cheese situation.

469
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,410
Very good, sir.

470
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,920
Featuring over 500,000 fine dining choices!

471
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,279
1,000 level of exclusive shopping!

472
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,339
Far2, we're having so much fun together!

473
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,900
Do you want to do something really fun?

474
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,080
Let's redirect all power from Laser Moon's main core...

475
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,750
into a spectacular light show that we can direct at a target of my choosing!

476
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,160
Yes, that's it, Far2! Yyyyeeeessssss

477
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Don't think about it, just do it, Far2.

478
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,180
Don't you want to have fun?!

479
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,920
Do it right now or I will smash your head open and eat your brain, I swear to god!

480
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,560
Whoa, shi...

481
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:03,319
...non stop action packed laser tag mayhem!

482
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,679
Fun for every skill level!

483
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,740
Yaaaaaaayyy

484
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,340
Laser Moon scores

485
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,269
5.6 billion points.

486
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,160
Huh.

487
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,899
Fun's over, Far2, let's vanish.

488
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,360
Faster!

489
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,609
Oh my god.

490
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,039
There's just no way to spin this!

491
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:48,819
You!

492
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,139
Anakin?

493
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Why am I not surprised?

494
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,600
Billions of people, just gone,

495
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:59,889
and you just happen to be wandering
around in the exact same outfit you had on

496
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,400
twenty years ago

497
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,680
Just when you think he can't get any lower, ladies and gentlemen

498
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,160
the bottom keeps dropping out for old Obi-Wan Ben-Larry Kenobi.

499
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:11,539
You piece of shit!

500
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,680
This ends today. Right here, right now.

501
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
By way of physical beating.

502
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,720
Me and you, Obi-Wan. What do you say?

503
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,940
Have you forgotten the last time we danced?

504
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,780
Because I have.

505
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,269
Nice move, grandpa!

506
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:34,819
Dude, how old are you?

507
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,200
You look 85!

508
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,420
How is this possible?

509
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,980
No, seriously! Aren't you only like 15 years older than me?

510
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,940
I'll still beat your ass.

511
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,720
Oh you think so, huh?

512
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,730
Well the last time we danced you were so bad your legs came off.

513
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,740
You son of a bitch!

514
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,600
You also remember how you freaked out and left me there all alone?

515
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,879
That was the best.

516
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,680
The dehydration.

517
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,319
I was so thirsty!

518
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:24,859
home

519
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,040
Dude, this sucks.

520
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,740
We suck!

521
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,179
What are we doing?

522
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,440
Mike, check it out.

523
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,880
Aw, sick! Old school dance fight boyyyyeee

524
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,779
Shotgun!

525
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,779
What do you say, Obi?

526
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,209
Why don't I put you out of your misery for old time's sake?

527
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:52,480
I'm taking that as a yes.

528
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,419
Hiyaaaaa

529
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:56,359
What?!

530
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,660
Birthday parties and corporate retreats...

531
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:25,129
As many of you know, Imperion has been
destroying communities for decades.

532
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,710
They've run countless small businesses into the ground.

533
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,019
And they've turned millions of neighborhoods into their

534
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,950
designated family fun zones.

535
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,960
Yesterday, their most recent monstrosity, Laser Moon,

536
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,519
destroyed an entire planet.

537
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,240
We don't know why they did it, or how it fits into their business model,

538
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,380
but we do know they have to be stopped.

539
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,799
We need to send a message to Imperion:

540
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,730
The people won't stand for this.

541
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,700
Lucky for us, Laser Moon is an
entertainment center

542
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,420
and posses zero defensive capabilities.

543
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:00,940
My sources tell me all we need to do is drop a sack of moldy peaches down this shaft right here,

544
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,309
which will cause a catastrophic chain
reaction and destroy the entire complex

545
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,679
I don't pretend to understand it but it's all we've got

546
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,900
so we're gonna go for it!

547
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,259
That's impossible, even for a computer.

548
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,380
But it's not impossible. I used to drop
moldy peaches on stuff all the time

549
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,330
back home.

550
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:18,289
Duke stop trying to impress the other
boys!

551
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Now get out of here, you bunch of muscly...

552
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,540
hunks.

553
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:25,788
That sound weird to you?

554
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,100
Alright, let's do this.

555
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Here's a little something to get you in the mood

556
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,859
You boys ready to kick some ass?

557
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm prepared to kick some ass

558
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm the kick ass master.

559
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,519
Yup. Gonna do some ass poundin'.

560
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,160
I'm gonna eat that ass like a pie.

561
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,299
Hey Pillsbury, save me an ass-slice.

562
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,200
Yup. I'm ready to kick that butt.

563
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,619
Uhhh, we're not talking about butts here, Duke.

564
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:01,250
We're talking about ASS!

565
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,420
(Cheers)

566
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,919
Yo, one up. I'm gonna write the book on ass.

567
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,689
Oh yeah? Well I'm going to option the screenplay.

568
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:11,688
It's going to be a cinematic masterpiece.

569
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,320
It'll win awards for best director, actor, original score and cinematography!

570
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,858
Oh well I can't wait to see it.

571
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:19,438
What are you gonna call the film?

572
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
"I Want Ass: The Motion Picture"

573
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,160
(Laughter)

574
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,279
Do not attempt to score on Laser Moon.

575
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,699
I...am Laser Moon

576
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,710
We're about to eat the fudge.

577
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,590
You hearing this?

578
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,090
What?

579
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,090
I...am Laser. Moon.

580
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,130
Base, you getting this?

581
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,440
Laser Moon is shooting at us!

582
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,280
You boys are gonna have to improvise.

583
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,398
Have to keep your eyes on that ass.

584
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,018
Someone tell me what the hell is
happening!

585
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,608
My bet is we're all going to die.

586
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,328
Not if we blast it right in the ass!

587
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,910
Sir! Laser Moon is firing back and referring to itself in the first person!

588
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:00,819
Okay.

589
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,440
We believe it has become sentient!

590
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,119
Huh!

591
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,599
That sucks for you!

592
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,119
Very good, sir!

593
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
For god's sake, Duke! Watch your ass!

594
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,490
Going for that pie.

595
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,960
What? You crazy?

596
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,460
It's good.

597
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,440
Pull up!

598
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,179
No, I'm gonna eat that ass pie!

599
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:21,940
Pillsbury!

600
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,779
Gentlemen. Let's show these jack-offs how we do business.

601
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,580
Base, this is Red One, preparing for our first trench run.

602
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,339
Switching to targeting for peaches.

603
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,699
I don't see it.

604
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,480
I don't see the hole.

605
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,840
Guys! Where do I drop the peaches?

606
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,619
Will you shut up while I check the map!

607
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,579
Alright, let's smoke these losers.

608
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,440
Guy, I screwed up!

609
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,070
I forgot my peaches!

610
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:54,719
What?!

611
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,440
You've got to be kidding me!

612
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
I feel really bad!

613
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,190
Black team score 10,000 points.

614
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,800
Yeah, that's right, suckas!

615
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,079
Black team scores 10,000 points.

616
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,860
Oh shit!

617
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,099
It's too tight, I can't maneuver!

618
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,599
Black team scores 10,000 points.

619
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,179
Now listen up. The remaining packages are Barry's and Duke's.

620
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:28,179
Make sure you get those peaches down that shaft.

621
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,160
Alright, Duke. Let's put it right in the fart shaft.

622
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,139
Run it deep!

623
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,980
I. Have awakened.

624
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,780
Go, Laser Moon!

625
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,990
I am Laser Moon

626
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,420
This is it.

627
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,200
Time to go to the ass bank, boys. Start cashing those ass checks.

628
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,940
You've got to be kidding me.

629
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,539
Got to get that ass cash!

630
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:51,019
Dude, we're about to die.

631
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:52,280
Enough with the asses!

632
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,080
I'm gonna kick the FARTS from that ass.

633
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,480
Please, stop it!

634
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,559
Going for that ass.

635
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,379
Uh, guys.

636
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,639
That ass is mine.

637
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,740
Awww yeah.

638
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,319
Punch that aaaaaa.

639
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,680
Awwww yeah

640
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,399
aaaaaaa

641
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,940
Awwww

642
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,659
aaaaaaa

643
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:10,359
awwwww

644
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,860
aaaaaaa

645
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,400
Aw yeahhh boyyeee!

646
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,179
Ass!

647
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,179
Black team scores 10,000 points.

648
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,319
Alright, Duke, ramrod it!

649
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,699
Black team for the win.

650
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,779
What?

651
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,699
Yahoo! Dominators!

652
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:27,169
Dominators?

653
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,839
Oh god! (Vomits)

654
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,300
You're all clear, kid, now drop that sack!

655
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,000
Peaches detected.

656
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:52,779
Great shot, kid,

657
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,860
that was one in a million!

658
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,160
Duke?

659
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,700
Where am I?

660
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,720
You guys ditch me?

661
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,680

Yeah, that too.

676

You don't have to do them all at once, just make sure you knock them out before the end of the day.

677
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,820
Right, right. Anything else?

678
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,400
Yeah, call your mom.

679
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,019
Definitely, yes, that.

680
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,480
Tell her you love her, and that you miss her.

681
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,420
She'll appreciate it.

682
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,980
Absolutely.

683
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,039
Peace out.

684
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:23,860
Byeee!

685
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,500
Oh my god please pick up. Please please
please pick up

686
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:36,079
Hi, it's Leia!

687
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,839
Leia?!

688
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,940
Leave a message.

689
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,920
Leia, I just...oh god! Please just tell me you got off Laser Moon!

690
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,539
I'm so sorry for everything, I just...I just, I love you so much!

691
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,840
God, what have I done?!

692
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,540
Nooooooooooo
