635
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:14,880
reason could he have well<font color="#CCCCCC"> barovik the</font>

636
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:19,619
papyrus but if he<font color="#CCCCCC"> stole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it means we have</font>

01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:22,980
the same goal same purpose no that's

638
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:24,750
impossible impossible impossible or not

639
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:29,130
we must all get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to civilization at</font>

remarkable man I hardly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know him but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

649
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:56,519
I've never met anyone more completely

650
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,989
dedicated that poor girl what she must

651
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:01,230
have gone through in the past few days

652
01:03:57,989 --> 01:04:06,629
why the hell did he bring her out

653
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:07,980
curiously enough Waverly I think she was

654
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:12,660
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> he came here in the first</font>

655
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:17,849
place listen dialing I'm listen you're

01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:21,630
please if nothing else you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must know</font>

658
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:25,320
that I'm beginning to wonder if I do

659
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:27,780
know anything about him<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't tell you</font>

660
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore I mean not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you'll</font>

661
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,950
understand but the mountain must be the

662
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:33,750
key to it all sir possibly tried

663
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:36,929
possibly but it's all purely academic

664
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:38,849
you know we only got as far as an inner

665
01:04:36,929 --> 01:04:40,679
chamber but they looked as though

666
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:43,019
there's a warren of tunnels on to that

667
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,059
mountain every move<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make everything</font>

668
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:46,949
this whole affair concerns our future

669
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:51,929
together but if it's anything like now

670
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:58,919
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be pretty old it will I</font>

671
01:04:51,929 --> 01:05:01,319
promise you it's just that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

674
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:10,710
of desperate importance to me this

675
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:13,140
expedition isn't really the reason we

676
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,420
came out here is it I mean there's

677
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:18,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else well we could search the</font>

678
