1
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,659
As far as I can remember,

2
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:42,460
I've hated Christmas.

3
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:50,569
What does it say, Christian?

4
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,670
Gimme my car!

5
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:55,006
Christmas 1960

6
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:57,808
It should work.

7
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,010
Stop picking your nose.

8
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:01,612
It's working!

9
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,882
There we go.

10
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:07,117
Mine's not moving.

11
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,120
Gervais!

12
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:13,290
Han?

13
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:19,189
How are you feeling?

14
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,295
He's so cute!
Look, kids.

15
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,530
It's your little brother!

16
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:28,532
- Baby Jesus!
- Let me hold him.

17
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,268
Here you go.

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,203
He's beautiful.

19
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:34,972
Let me see!

20
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:47,018
Christmas 1966

21
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,987
Not only would my birthday
always go unnoticed,

22
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,691
but it had to start
with midnight mass.

23
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,350
Midnight mass is too long!

24
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:22,353
Go home and open your presents!

25
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,246
On the contrary, you're lucky
to share his birthday.

26
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,248
That doesn't happen
to just anyone.

27
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,251
It's special.

28
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,320
Hence the birthmark
on your scalp. Hmm?

29
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,524
It's a sign of being gifted,
you know.

30
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,501
At least, after mass,

31
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,236
there was the Christmas Eve party
at Grandma's.

32
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,978
Hello, my beautiful Zac.

33
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,882
The only advantage to having
one's birthday on Christmas

34
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,684
was getting a bigger present
than everyone else.

35
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,430
He likes it, huh?

36
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:44,536
But I especially hated Christmas
because I never got what I wanted.

37
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:46,737
Dammit.

38
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,440
It's what he wanted.

39
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,675
So? It's not up to him.

40
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,344
You want to turn him into a fairy?

41
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:57,347
- Stop it. He's only five!
- He's almost six and looks seven.

42
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,684
- Oh, come on!
- Never mind "come on."

43
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,286
Now return it. Go on.

44
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,967
It would make you
a laughingstock, son.

45
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,971
Daddy doesn't want that.

46
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,448
Daddy isn't trying to upset you.

47
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,283
He loves you far too much.

48
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,786
Hence the hockey game.

49
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:38,455
So he can play with you.

50
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,625
Go to sleep.

51
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,593
Mommy will have a nice surprise

52
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,162
for you soon.

53
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,830
- For my birthday?
- No, after. You'll see.

54
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,500
Go to sleep.

55
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:56,574
What's a fairy?

56
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:03,281
Nothing.

57
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,115
Hogwash.

58
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,783
Go to sleep.

59
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,555
Idiot.

60
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:17,327
I knew very well
what a fairy was.

61
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:20,398
I especially knew...

62
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,633
I didn't want to be one.

63
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:35,979
Want to play, Zac?

64
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:37,615
No.

65
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,526
Unlike my friends' fathers,

66
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:52,129
all of whom
were ordinary and uninteresting,

67
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,033
mine was the best in the world.

68
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,302
He has Patsy Cline's,
Buddy Rich's

69
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:58,836
and Aznavour's
entire collections.

70
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,506
He fired a machine gun
in the army.

71
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:57,427
Our secret side trips
to Norm The King Of Fries

72
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,396
made me deliriously happy.

73
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,500
For a few precious moments,
I was his favorite.

74
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:04,502
Take me

75
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,504
To the ends of the earth

76
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:08,039
Take me

77
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,507
To Wonderland

78
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,009
It seems to me

79
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,345
That misery

80
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,880
Would be borne more easily
under the sun

81
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:27,692
Hi!

82
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,193
Hello.

83
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,361
- You didn't bring any back?
- What?

84
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,764
Fries, you moron.

85
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:34,666
You can smell it a mile away.

86
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:37,302
We didn't have any fries.

87
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,803
Did we?

88
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,975
My three brothers were morons.

89
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:47,345
Starting with Christian,

90
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:48,680
the egghead,

91
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:50,180
who read constantly -

92
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:53,017
anything, anytime, anywhere;

93
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,288
Antoine, the sports nut,
a walking stinkbomb;

94
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:02,759
- What're you looking at?
- And Raymond,

95
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,328
my sworn enemy.

96
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,663
Get lost, you pisser.

97
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:09,966
Dad, Raymond called me
a pussy!

98
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,069
Not a pussy, a pisser.

99
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:15,306
Kitchen.

100
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:20,644
I could understand him

101
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:22,513
being proud of Christian,
or Antoine.

102
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,382
But Raymond?

103
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,491
Aren't you going to introduce us?

104
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,827
My dad.

105
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:41,298
- You're going out, Raymond?
- The little bastard's a Casanova.

106
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:44,999
But he asked
for more ironed toast!

107
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,340
Hi, pretty baby.

108
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,110
After nine months of prayer...

109
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,979
and superhuman feats...

110
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:59,250
the good Lord
would finally give me...

111
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:00,451
Another boy?

112
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,920
What kind of lead you got
in your pencil, Beaulieu?

113
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,990
What can I say?
I have a surplus of male hormones.

114
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:07,658
- A surplus of hormones!
- That's irrelevant.

115
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:09,659
He has to change positions

116
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,161
once in a while.

117
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,431
Yeah, well, I've tried that.

118
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,734
What can I say? Five boys -
you take what you can get.

119
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:24,975
Come on, Zac.

120
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,428
You like my surprise?

121
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:19,297
Christmas 1967

122
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:43,254
Take me

123
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:45,022
To the ends of the earth

124
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,591
Take me

125
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,259
To Wonderland

126
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:52,129
It seems to me that misery

127
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,599
Would be borne more easily
under the sun

128
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,800
Drop by sometime.

129
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:08,078
See? Look. Again.

130
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:10,580
Zac has a gift.
I'm sure of it.

131
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:13,317
His colic stops
whenever Zac holds him.

132
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:17,088
I'll go see Mrs. What's-her-name,
the Tupperware lady.

133
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:18,755
She, too, has a gift.

134
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:21,925
She can staunch bleeding,
heal burns and everything.

135
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,095
She'll tell us if he's gifted.

136
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:26,764
No. You've seen
how he plays the drums.

137
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,932
A regular little Buddy Rich.

138
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,270
Music runs in his blood,
I'm telling you. That's his gift.

139
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,907
He gets that from his old man.

140
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:25,956
Hi, pretty baby.

141
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:29,060
Mommy's little darling.

142
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,836
I can still remember the snow
slowly melting on his face.

143
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:43,007
I had just turned seven
and, unwittingly,

144
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,141
declared war to my father.

145
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:58,322
Are you crazy,

146
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,158
dammit?!
What are you doing?!

147
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,394
Roll that window back up,
you nitwit!

148
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:05,629
Do we have to tie you up?

149
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,465
Here, buckle up!

150
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:11,802
Christ.

151
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,242
Use your head, you nitwit.

152
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,910
Stop slurping, you pig!
Don't be such a sissy!

153
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,484
Eleven bucks!

154
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:29,220
An imported collector's record.

155
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,089
You'll each reimburse me
if the guilty party

156
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,992
doesn't come forward.
I'm warning you.

157
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,761
I'll teach you to take
responsibility for your actions,

158
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,429
dammit!
- Gervais!

159
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:04,120
I didn't do it.

160
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,065
It was an accident.

161
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:18,903
Scoot, you three.

162
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,213
You'll not only pay for the record,
but your lies, too.

163
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,581
I'll teach you, you'll see.

164
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,283
Go to your room!

165
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,355
He said it was an accident.

166
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:50,134
What in heaven's name
did you do to him?

167
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,972
Zac. He's changed.

168
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,975
He's a crybaby, he dresses
like a girl. It's not normal.

169
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:01,111
Get over it.
It's you who's not normal.

170
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,748
He's a child, for God's sake.
Let him be.

171
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:05,915
"What did I do to him"!

172
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,756
- The others weren't like that.
- Each of them is different.

173
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,760
Zac is more gentle, that's all.
More sensitive.

174
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:18,928
He's not gentler, he's softer.

175
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:26,803
God, please don't let me be soft.

176
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:29,639
And return my dad
to his old self.

177
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,141
Shut up.

178
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:44,721
Use your head, you nitwit!
Don't be such a sissy!

179
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:51,162
I did it on purpose.

180
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,896
I'll tell Dad, you pisser.

181
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,733
When will I stop wetting the bed?
I've been asking him a long time.

182
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,536
Never mind - no harm done.

183
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,771
Hmm?
You're not alone.

184
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,106
It'll stop eventually.

185
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,910
Keep praying. You'll see,
Baby Jesus will hear you.

186
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:43,113
Especially you.

187
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,782
You were born on the same day.

188
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,451
Sweet dreams.

189
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:04,835
Big chimneys, huh?

190
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,504
Where are we going?

191
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:10,340
You'll see.

192
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,842
Careful.

193
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,990
Mrs. What's-her-name,
the Tupperware lady,

194
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:29,659
had realized my mother's dream:

195
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:33,029
she had walked
in Christ's footsteps.

196
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,904
Try to trust your feelings.

197
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:43,807
You can feel things others can't.

198
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:48,045
You mustn't fear it.

199
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:53,484
He's been blessed
from on high, Mrs. Beaulieu.

200
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,318
The good Lord chose him

201
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:58,489
knowing he was strong enough
for what's expected of him.

202
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,759
But give him a chance
to grow up a bit. Hmm?

203
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,528
So he better understands.

204
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,563
He's a good-looking boy.

205
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,333
He'll go far.

206
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:14,672
Christ...mas, I'm bushed!

207
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,008
I've got news for you.

208
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,676
Your son has a gift.

209
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:23,846
A family's seventh child
of the same sex is gifted.

210
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:26,850
With my three miscarriages,
that makes Zac seventh.

211
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:31,755
Who says your miscarriages
were boys?

212
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:35,526
They must've been.
That's all you can do.

213
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,860
We knew he could stop colic,
but he's otherwise gifted.

214
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:40,431
Gifted people
can pass their gift on to others,

215
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,334
if they're of the opposite sex
and not related.

216
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,769
Mrs. What's-her-name
passed all of hers on to him.

217
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,505
Oh, Jesus.

218
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:51,008
How much Tupperware
did that cost you?

219
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:54,077
None.
She didn't try selling me any.

220
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:56,446
I bought some.
It's different.

221
00:19:58,349 --> 00:19:59,682
This is no joke.

222
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:01,885
He's truly gifted!

223
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:04,355
Can your gift cure my headache?

224
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,800
There.

225
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:22,905
What's this?

226
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:24,775
Look.

227
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,846
It's not my birthday,
as far as I know.

228
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,956
Your record's unfindable.
We bought another.

229
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:41,258
It's the same thing!

230
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,162
I know.
I already have this one.

231
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:49,199
The sound's not the same.

232
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,534
An imported collector's record
isn't the same.

233
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:55,105
It's the thought that counts.
I'll just return it, then.

234
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,744
Raymond, Antoine!
That's enough!

235
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:02,311
Christian! Supper's ready.

236
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:08,418
Come on, boys. Let's eat.
- Coming.

237
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:11,455
Gifted...

238
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:14,625
What do you think about that?

239
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,796
What did Mrs. What's-her-name
tell you?

240
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,798
I'm not allowed to say.

241
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:24,801
But she told Mom that if
the good Lord gave me a gift,

242
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,636
I had to use it.

243
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:30,807
That I could help a lot of people,
even save them.

244
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,446
Tell him to think of him.

245
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:45,689
Think of Uncle Lucien.
He cut himself eating steak.

246
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,593
They're not going to start calling
for every little booboo?

247
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,230
Turn that music down.

248
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,301
All I had to do

249
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:00,403
was silently recite the secret
little prayers imparted to me

250
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,107
by Mrs. What's-her-name,
which consisted not of asking,

251
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:07,444
but of commanding God to heal.

252
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:12,782
Remember, you can't use
your gift for personal gain.

253
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,653
Or to harm others.

254
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,788
What a shame.

255
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,758
What's he saying?

256
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,362
He's not allowed to say.
Stop it, will you?

257
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:33,170
From now on, it'll cost a dime
every time you pick your nose.

258
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,204
You'll be rich.

259
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,841
You must know
how ketchup's made by now,

260
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,844
you've been reading the damn label
for half an hour.

261
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:49,385
Another pest
who just cut himself shaving.

262
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,188
Okay, I'll tell him.

263
00:22:56,394 --> 00:22:58,461
Uncle Lucien's bleeding
has stopped.

264
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,142
Yes?

265
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:15,045
Well, I'll be damned.

266
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,614
Great. He'll be thrilled.

267
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,615
Yes. Thank you.

268
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,659
What is it?

269
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:30,527
Your lucky brother

270
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:33,730
is going to summer camp.
- What?!

271
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:36,299
I wasn't allowed to go at his age!

272
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,302
You got yours.
Stop complaining.

273
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:40,804
We've never sent our children
to camp.

274
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:44,641
He'll sleep there?

275
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:48,478
Of course. He'll make friends,
have lots of fun...

276
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:50,846
It'll be a good experience
for him.

277
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:53,984
- He'll always remember it.
- I don't wanna go.

278
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,153
Oh, come on.

279
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,789
I don't wanna go.

280
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:08,264
I don't wanna go!!!

281
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,956
God, please don't let it happen.

282
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:44,801
Go to sleep.

283
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:56,772
God, please,

284
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:59,108
don't let it show.

285
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:01,778
I'll never miss mass again.

286
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:55,218
Midnight mass
was so short and sweet

287
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,487
now that I'd become an atheist.

288
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,889
I'd kept my promise, though.

289
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:03,360
I'd never missed mass...
midnight mass.

290
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,060
Once a year.

291
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,264
It made her happy.

292
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:10,000
It kept his mouth shut.

293
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,954
You dragging your trash around,
brother-in-law?

294
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:40,990
It's your present.

295
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,958
Well, if it isn't Zac!

296
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,060
What, no girlfriend yet?

297
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:56,405
Christmas 1975

298
00:30:58,142 --> 00:30:59,308
Nice paper.

299
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,311
Every year, I told them:

300
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,014
No Christmas wrapping paper
for my birthday presents, okay?

301
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:05,914
That's not what matters.

302
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:13,423
After the drum set, accordion,
guitar and violin...

303
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,590
a banjo.

304
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:17,259
You said to surprise you.

305
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:21,765
It's so hard to know
what teenagers want nowadays.

306
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:23,932
You try to please them...

307
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:58,567
Some fantasies
are worth keeping.

308
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,839
Merry Christmas!
Happy New Year!

309
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,075
You know what time it is,
Raymond?

310
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,042
You're late.

311
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:09,712
I was starting to worry.

312
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,381
- Hi. I'm Doris.
- Good evening.

313
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:13,383
- Merry Christmas.
- Take off your boots.

314
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,884
- How are you?
- Hi, Dad.

315
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:16,885
- Merry Christmas.
- Pleased to meet you.

316
00:32:17,054 --> 00:32:18,621
I'm Raymond's mother.

317
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:26,629
My family always
appreciated gourmet food.

318
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,168
Did you at least make a wish?

319
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:35,038
It won't come true,
he can't get it up yet.

320
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,576
My brothers
hadn't changed a bit.

321
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:42,678
Dad, Zac gave him the finger!

322
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:45,013
- Except my darling Yvan.
- Such brotherly love!

323
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:47,983
And how polite
they are in public.

324
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:51,121
Turn that music down.

325
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:07,803
Every Christmas,

326
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:09,838
the bastard barely stayed an hour.

327
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:12,307
Just long enough
to stuff himself...

328
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:14,144
and to piss me off.

329
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:30,492
Here, buy whatever you want.

330
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:33,496
Happy birthday.

331
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:34,830
Wait.

332
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:01,124
I loved daydreaming
about my mother.

333
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,658
Picturing myself wealthy,

334
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:05,127
so that, one day,
I could spoil her.

335
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,231
Merry Christmas!

336
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,771
It's beautiful. Thank you.

337
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:26,349
Oh, what a lovely dress.

338
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:24,307
My cousin Brigitte
had just dropped out of school

339
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:27,976
to devote herself
to social dancing full-time.

340
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:29,646
At the age of 15.

341
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:54,202
I can dance too, you know!

342
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,441
But it's not my specialty.

343
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:00,809
Back by popular request...

344
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:02,211
No getting around it.

345
00:36:17,494 --> 00:36:18,995
It's your birthday!

346
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:22,532
- You've really changed.
- Yeah, you too.

347
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,068
This is my boyfriend, Paul.

348
00:36:26,235 --> 00:36:27,903
My cousin, Zac.

349
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,240
He has his driver's license!

350
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:36,579
I'm stealing one.

351
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,260
- You don't smoke?
- Never touch the stuff.

352
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,932
Good thing. If it was up to him,
he'd be smoking nonstop.

353
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,266
We go to the movies,
he wants to smoke;

354
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:00,268
we go skating,
he wants to smoke...

355
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:02,070
You skate? Roller-skate?

356
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:11,213
The guys' turn, full blast,
music blaring, really stoned -

357
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:14,384
you let yourself go...
you can hear everything,

358
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,886
and feel like everything around you
is moving in slow-motion,

359
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:19,554
like in a movie.

360
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:24,726
A stoner movie, yeah.

361
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:29,065
Try it.

362
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:30,733
Give me a shotgun.

363
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,067
No way.

364
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,568
Are you nuts?

365
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:35,905
I burned my tongue last time.

366
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:41,744
I thought of you
and it stopped burning.

367
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,913
He has a gift
for healing burns.

368
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:45,581
- What?
- And staunching blood.

369
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,751
It's true! Tell him!

370
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,423
My mother got that
into the whole family's head.

371
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,925
You stop your girlfriend's
monthly bleeding, too?

372
00:37:58,594 --> 00:37:59,928
Idiot.

373
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:02,231
That's it, make a fool of me.

374
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,035
I don't believe in that anymore.
Sorry.

375
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,206
That doesn't mean
you've lost your blessing.

376
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,041
You blessed fool!

377
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,716
You want a shotgun?

378
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:39,602
Boy, have you changed!

379
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,763
Well, well...
if it isn't the lovely Michelle.

380
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,599
- Hi, Mr. Beaulieu.
- Hi.

381
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,402
I'll finish up later.

382
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:16,905
No problem.

383
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,751
- Is she really on the pill?
- Enough about my cousin.

384
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:31,420
I'm not the one
who wants to sleep with her.

385
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:33,656
That's the last time
I confide in you.

386
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:36,592
Why are the prettiest girls
always the dumbest?

387
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:39,761
You've never seen her.

388
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:42,764
I've seen her picture.
Enough said.

389
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,434
Don't be jealous.

390
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:49,105
You're dumb too.

391
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,614
I see her once a year. How am
I supposed to sleep with her?

392
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:01,449
Anyway, she's got a boyfriend.

393
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:05,454
Older. As dumb as she is.

394
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:13,461
Not as dumb as you?

395
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:17,132
Don't.

396
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:24,639
It'll ruin our friendship.

397
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:28,978
That's not what you said
last week.

398
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:31,646
Stop it.

399
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,153
See what happens?

400
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:41,324
Absolutely nothing!

401
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:03,778
Don't tell me he groped her.

402
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:09,872
You done imitating
that fucking fag?

403
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:13,041
Huh?! You're making us
look like a bunch of idiots!

404
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,427
Get outta here!

405
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:37,799
It's my room too!

406
00:43:49,146 --> 00:43:51,480
C'mon, Toto,
ask him for an autograph.

407
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,151
Got a problem?

408
00:43:57,153 --> 00:43:58,320
No.

409
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,701
Having a crazy brother
also had its advantages.

410
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:16,271
- Always ready to help...
- Pay up, you little bastard.

411
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,441
... for the modest sum of $2.

412
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:54,376
We were here first.

413
00:44:54,543 --> 00:44:56,110
Shut up, faggot.

414
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:01,182
What did you call him?

415
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:05,520
Apologize.

416
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:11,993
Apologize
and switch back to his show.

417
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:24,906
Apologize, I said!!!

418
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:30,846
It's okay, Dad.

419
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,987
Go on!!

420
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,227
Sorry.

421
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:56,771
What's for dinner?

422
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:00,775
What happened to you?

423
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:03,244
Just a hockey fight.

424
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:06,681
- Didn't you have practice today?
- Yeah, yeah.

425
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:07,916
You fought with a teammate?

426
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,386
It was just a scuffle.
Didn't even drop my gloves.

427
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:14,123
- Who with?
- Tremblay.

428
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,559
You got beaten up
by Tremblay's little fag?

429
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,228
What, you four-eyed fag?

430
00:46:21,797 --> 00:46:24,299
What's with you always
calling each other fags?

431
00:46:25,135 --> 00:46:27,970
You'd swear we're nothing
but a bunch of fairies!

432
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:50,992
Please...

433
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:54,829
anything but that.

434
00:47:07,443 --> 00:47:09,277
Sorry about last night.

435
00:47:11,614 --> 00:47:14,782
You know I don't like you talking
to your brother that way.

436
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,284
Yeah...

437
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,659
Okay, see you at work.

438
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,427
Careful, now.

439
00:48:17,012 --> 00:48:19,480
Please let me bump into them.

440
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:35,396
What're you doing here?

441
00:48:37,266 --> 00:48:40,935
- Just in the neighborhood.
- God, you've changed.

442
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:42,603
What'd you do to your hair?

443
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:43,938
It's cool.

444
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,440
Thanks.

445
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:49,278
You alone?
- No, I'm with...

446
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:51,612
my new dance partner.

447
00:48:55,117 --> 00:48:56,617
He's Italian.

448
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:01,223
Thank you.

449
00:49:02,057 --> 00:49:03,592
This is my cousin, Zac.

450
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:16,404
Okay, well...

451
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:18,673
I'll be off.

452
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,349
Change... Change...

453
00:50:01,518 --> 00:50:05,052
I would be cured of my asthma...

454
00:50:05,221 --> 00:50:07,588
if I only managed to get through.

455
00:50:21,403 --> 00:50:23,438
For the second time of my life...

456
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:30,978
I was declared clinically dead...

457
00:50:33,516 --> 00:50:35,184
for three seconds.

458
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:17,058
Thank God you were dedicated
to Virgin Mary.

459
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:22,397
I can't believe it.

460
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:24,066
It's a miracle.

461
00:51:26,068 --> 00:51:28,237
You know you made your father cry?

462
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,574
Don't ever scare us
like that again.

463
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,750
Feel like talking?

464
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,257
I'll come back later.

465
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:53,161
While my mother performed
charitable works daily...

466
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:58,233
her Baby Jesus
had only one thing on his mind.

467
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:28,724
You asshole!

468
00:53:35,063 --> 00:53:36,731
What're you doing?!

469
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:45,239
Fucking liar.

470
00:54:20,576 --> 00:54:22,577
The hottest was a black chick.

471
00:54:22,744 --> 00:54:24,746
It was like
she'd never eaten before.

472
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:28,750
Mind you, they smoked a couple
of joints. Makes you hungry.

473
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:30,919
She sucked him like a Hoover!

474
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,587
He held her head,
thrusting as deep as he could.

475
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:35,757
The harder she sucked,
the more he screamed.

476
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:38,226
The more he screamed,
the harder she sucked.

477
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:53,642
Ever had a blow job?

478
00:54:59,748 --> 00:55:01,682
What do you want?

479
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,274
I was wondering
where my shades went.

480
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:30,445
Going somewhere?

481
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:36,117
Boy, is this gonna cost me!

482
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,121
I didn't ask for nothing.

483
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:44,458
Your neck still sore?

484
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,297
We're out of HP Sauce.

485
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:53,134
You get a 2-for-1 special today.

486
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:54,803
You'll learn to drive properly

487
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:58,139
and how to make your father's
world-class spaghetti sauce.

488
00:55:58,373 --> 00:56:00,608
Let's go,
before your mother catches us.

489
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:05,646
Go ahead. Turn the key,
put it on "D.”

490
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:09,317
Good. Slowly, now.
Go ahead.

491
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:11,653
- HP Sauce?
- That's my secret.

492
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,654
Watch where you're going
and shut up.

493
00:56:13,822 --> 00:56:16,490
Lesson number one:
shut up and drive.

494
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:19,828
Go ahead.

495
00:56:20,663 --> 00:56:23,398
Slow down!
What are you, nuts?

496
00:56:37,012 --> 00:56:38,445
What are you doing?

497
00:56:38,614 --> 00:56:41,081
The school principal just called.

498
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,851
Seems your son's been spreading
rumors about Raymond!

499
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:46,253
I won't stand for smut around here!

500
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:48,423
Much less drugs!

501
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:49,623
What?

502
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,795
If I have to call the police
to make Raymond understand,

503
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:55,864
I'll do it this time!

504
00:56:56,532 --> 00:56:58,033
What's all this about?

505
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:02,370
Huh?!

506
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:04,572
What's this?

507
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:06,574
His little brothers live here!

508
00:57:37,273 --> 00:57:39,074
Stay away from me, I said!

509
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:44,613
I didn't rat him out.

510
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:18,313
He's already gone.
I didn't even say goodbye.

511
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:20,982
Could be the wrong time,
but can I have his room?

512
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,653
- I want it!
- No one's taking his room.

513
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,321
Especially not you.

514
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:02,990
Does this mean
we're not just friends anymore?

515
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:07,128
I dunno.

516
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,297
What do you think?

517
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,315
What's he doing here?

518
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,653
Toto the Weirdo.

519
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,389
Forget him.

520
00:59:39,929 --> 00:59:41,429
Peeping Tom.

521
00:59:43,065 --> 00:59:44,566
What're you looking at?!

522
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:51,405
Fucker.

523
01:00:14,996 --> 01:00:18,500
She's so excited.
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

524
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:22,871
She went on and on about Brigitte.
We'll never hear the end of it.

525
01:00:23,038 --> 01:00:26,007
Seems she's putting together
a big show with her boyfriend

526
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:27,509
this Christmas Eve.

527
01:00:27,675 --> 01:00:30,344
- With the Italian?
- No, she's back with the other.

528
01:00:30,512 --> 01:00:32,346
The mambo dancer?

529
01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:34,348
He missed her big knockers.

530
01:00:34,516 --> 01:00:37,518
Who's the pig
who ate all my lard spread?

531
01:00:41,523 --> 01:00:44,358
Think of your little cousin Daniel;
he burned himself.

532
01:00:46,362 --> 01:00:47,862
Too bad!

533
01:00:54,536 --> 01:00:57,204
Rutting teenager
in his natural habitat.

534
01:00:57,373 --> 01:00:58,873
Shut up!

535
01:01:00,775 --> 01:01:02,309
What teenager?

536
01:01:18,893 --> 01:01:21,995
You didn't come
just for my Tupperware?

537
01:01:29,405 --> 01:01:31,973
How are you coping
with your gift?

538
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,090
Beautiful story.

539
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:54,261
A man dreamed he was walking
with Christ on the beach

540
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:56,931
while watching scenes of his life
flash across the sky.

541
01:01:58,766 --> 01:02:00,434
Upon turning around,

542
01:02:00,603 --> 01:02:03,070
he noticed that
throughout most of his life,

543
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:05,874
there were two sets
of footprints in the sand,

544
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,209
his and those of Christ.

545
01:02:10,612 --> 01:02:12,880
Except during the worst times
of his life,

546
01:02:13,047 --> 01:02:16,083
when there was only one set
of prints.

547
01:02:17,952 --> 01:02:19,954
The man said to Jesus,

548
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:23,290
"You promised
you would walk with me always.

549
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:26,793
Why did you forsake me
when I needed you most?"

550
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:30,632
Jesus replied...

551
01:02:32,467 --> 01:02:36,136
"There was only one set
of footprints in the sand

552
01:02:36,304 --> 01:02:40,140
during the worst times
of your life,

553
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:42,310
because I carried you."

554
01:02:59,061 --> 01:03:00,628
I want to be like everyone else.

555
01:03:04,934 --> 01:03:07,402
Thank God, you never will.

556
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:28,782
What got into you?!

557
01:04:31,286 --> 01:04:33,454
You have to learn
to control yourself!

558
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,293
I'm not going to the Christmas
party this year.

559
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:46,868
The guy was twice his size.

560
01:04:48,202 --> 01:04:50,204
The little bastard's got nerve.

561
01:04:51,206 --> 01:04:53,374
He gets that from his old man.

562
01:04:55,376 --> 01:04:57,378
He's been doing well lately, huh?

563
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:59,379
You call that doing well?

564
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:01,748
A little fight's no big deal.

565
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,990
We should get him something special
this year, don't you think?

566
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,496
He just needed a girlfriend.

567
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:17,498
Michelle's a nice girl.

568
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:21,836
He said she invited him over
for Christmas Eve.

569
01:05:25,507 --> 01:05:27,175
He'll be 16.

570
01:05:27,342 --> 01:05:29,677
We can start
cutting him a little slack.

571
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:31,511
You didn't agree?

572
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:35,515
I said we'd discuss it.

573
01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:40,354
She can join us, if she wants
to spend Christmas with him.

574
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:42,856
She can't take him away from us
on his birthday.

575
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,528
He can do whatever he wants
when he's older.

576
01:05:48,697 --> 01:05:50,865
In the meantime, we celebrate
Christmas as a family.

577
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:01,742
What about a new stereo
for his room?

578
01:06:05,481 --> 01:06:07,815
I can't believe
what a good ear he has.

579
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:11,319
He gets that from me, too.

580
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:17,117
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't take me for an idiot!

581
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,153
What you did was wrong!

582
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:22,789
I didn't do anything.

583
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,793
- A liar, too!
- Let him explain.

584
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,629
See what that pram business
and your mollycoddling does?

585
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,966
He's never to set foot here again!
Is that clear?!

586
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:36,304
If you can't choose the right
friends, we'll do it for you.

587
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:38,139
Fucking little faggot.

588
01:07:38,306 --> 01:07:40,473
And you, you sap,
get dragged into it!

589
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:42,809
- Let him speak!
- Stop defending him!

590
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:44,979
I know what I saw!

591
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:47,949
What you did was wrong.
You don't do this.

592
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,152
We went in to warm up, that's all.

593
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,159
Did we ever beat you?

594
01:08:02,331 --> 01:08:05,599
Do we have to start,
so you stop mocking us!

595
01:08:08,603 --> 01:08:10,103
I'm sorry.

596
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:16,109
I don't understand.

597
01:08:16,278 --> 01:08:18,279
After everything
we've done for him.

598
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:22,283
This shouldn't be happening to us.

599
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:26,119
It can happen to anyone.
It's no one's fault.

600
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:30,791
Father Carbonneau says
we mustn't seek to lay blame.

601
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,961
Father Carbonneau?

602
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:36,130
I had to talk to someone.

603
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:40,134
- What am I, chopped liver?
- You're impossible to talk to.

604
01:08:44,372 --> 01:08:47,807
- The whole neighborhood will know.
- Of course not.

605
01:08:47,975 --> 01:08:50,310
No one else is to know about this.
Is that clear?

606
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,646
This is strictly a family matter.

607
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:03,591
What did the priest
have to say?

608
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:07,761
It's a sin, yes, but not the end
of the world. He's not alone.

609
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:10,431
The sin is in the act,
not the inclination.

610
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,267
Look who's talking.

611
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:16,103
Him and his cassock!

612
01:09:17,605 --> 01:09:18,605
Don't start.

613
01:09:18,774 --> 01:09:21,609
He says he knows a priest
who's real good with teenagers.

614
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:24,612
Forget it.
It's not a priest he needs.

615
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:27,547
Sometimes I wonder
why we pray to a long-haired guy

616
01:09:27,716 --> 01:09:30,284
who hangs out with a bunch of guys
in robes.

617
01:09:30,452 --> 01:09:32,119
- It's fishy.
- Honestly!

618
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:36,123
Why are there
no female priests, then?

619
01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:40,127
They're starting
to get on my nerves.

620
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:46,666
Anyway, we'll take care
of his problem immediately.

621
01:09:46,835 --> 01:09:48,802
It's all in his head.

622
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:53,073
Abnormal people get treated.

623
01:09:56,078 --> 01:09:59,080
People aren't born that way,
they become so.

624
01:09:59,247 --> 01:10:02,083
It's up to us to make sure
that our son doesn't.

625
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,118
Nature doesn't make mistakes.
There's no in-between.

626
01:10:04,286 --> 01:10:06,753
It's one or the other -
a boy or a girl.

627
01:10:08,256 --> 01:10:10,591
I'm willing to pay for a shrink
if necessary.

628
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:15,096
Our boy is a boy.

629
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:17,264
No way I sired a fairy.

630
01:10:17,431 --> 01:10:20,266
We'll wipe any such notions
right out of his head!

631
01:10:24,605 --> 01:10:26,273
You have to be sick

632
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,609
to spend your life sticking
your pecker up someone's ass!

633
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,448
You've got a short memory.

634
01:10:41,288 --> 01:10:42,789
That was different.

635
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:45,793
And we only tried it once.

636
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:47,293
Once?

637
01:10:49,296 --> 01:10:51,297
Once or twice.
I don't remember.

638
01:10:52,134 --> 01:10:53,634
Well, I do.

639
01:11:02,144 --> 01:11:04,578
I'm not seeing a shrink.
I'm warning you.

640
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:07,047
I don't have a problem.
Understand?

641
01:11:12,587 --> 01:11:14,588
He does take after his father.

642
01:11:46,654 --> 01:11:49,122
He's freaking out over nothing.

643
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,324
Nothing happened.

644
01:11:51,493 --> 01:11:53,327
We didn't touch each other.

645
01:11:54,462 --> 01:11:57,264
We jerked off in the same car,
no big deal.

646
01:12:00,068 --> 01:12:01,268
Why do it together,

647
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:02,603
then?

648
01:12:12,613 --> 01:12:14,080
Watching him excited you?

649
01:12:15,783 --> 01:12:17,451
I didn't watch him.

650
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:20,187
Do I look like a fag?

651
01:12:21,288 --> 01:12:24,625
Do I talk with a lisp?
Strut like a peacock?

652
01:12:27,462 --> 01:12:29,763
Nice idea of homosexuals
you've got there.

653
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:32,132
They're not all like that.

654
01:12:34,469 --> 01:12:36,636
They all become that way.

655
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:38,305
Sooner or later.

656
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:44,145
This is a waste of time.
I'm not a fag.

657
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:49,483
I'd rather die.

658
01:12:56,992 --> 01:12:58,893
It's just a figure of speech.

659
01:13:00,328 --> 01:13:01,762
Isn't it obvious?

660
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:05,766
Being happy and healthy,
or miserable and fucked-up?

661
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,667
It's a no-brainer.

662
01:13:13,073 --> 01:13:14,375
So?

663
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:17,878
A subconsciously deliberate
mistake.

664
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,048
What?

665
01:13:22,884 --> 01:13:25,719
He says I deliberately did that
in your car so you'd catch me,

666
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:27,720
find out I was gay

667
01:13:27,889 --> 01:13:30,724
and accept it so that I could.

668
01:13:42,904 --> 01:13:45,573
Twenty-five bucks
for that hogwash?

669
01:13:47,742 --> 01:13:49,743
You didn't buy it, I hope?

670
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:52,078
- 'Course not.
- Unbelievable.

671
01:13:52,247 --> 01:13:54,748
"A subconsciously deliberate
mistake"!

672
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:57,784
He'll deliberately reimburse me,
believe me!

673
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,421
What do you want?!

674
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:10,530
You want to take this in to him?

675
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:14,867
He'll be glad to see you.

676
01:14:15,036 --> 01:14:17,371
I'm sure he's forgiven you.

677
01:14:31,485 --> 01:14:32,619
Dad!

678
01:14:32,787 --> 01:14:34,355
How are you?

679
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:35,722
Come in, come in.

680
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,725
What're you doing?
Get out of here.

681
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,559
I don't have time.

682
01:14:39,728 --> 01:14:42,730
Your brother's waiting in the car.
I'll take a rain check.

683
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:50,237
Hey, bro.

684
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:51,871
How you doing?

685
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,907
So, you take my room,
you little bastard?

686
01:14:55,109 --> 01:14:57,110
Oh, Dad, I almost forgot.

687
01:14:57,845 --> 01:14:59,612
Can you lend me a few bucks?

688
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,548
I couldn't cash my cheque.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

689
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:16,262
Better than nothing.

690
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,830
See you.

691
01:17:13,014 --> 01:17:15,181
I would be cured

692
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:18,352
if I could simply make it
through the storm.

693
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:32,493
Happy birthday.

694
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:35,095
Christmas 1980

695
01:18:35,262 --> 01:18:38,265
Fall on your knees

696
01:18:41,269 --> 01:18:44,304
O hear the angel voices

697
01:18:46,507 --> 01:18:49,108
O night divine

698
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:52,112
The night...

699
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:54,947
When Christ was born

700
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:20,073
Yesterday when I was young

701
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,243
The taste of life was sweet
as rain upon my tongue

702
01:19:23,411 --> 01:19:26,947
I teased at life
as if it were a foolish game

703
01:19:27,114 --> 01:19:31,484
The way the evening breeze
may tease a candle flame

704
01:19:31,653 --> 01:19:34,421
The thousand dreams I dreamed
the splendid things I planned

705
01:19:34,588 --> 01:19:38,158
I always built alas
on weak and shifting sand

706
01:19:38,326 --> 01:19:41,929
I lived by night and shunned
the naked light of the day

707
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:47,466
And only now I see how
the years ran away

708
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:54,173
So many drinking songs
were waiting to be sung

709
01:19:54,341 --> 01:19:56,842
So many wayward pleasures
lay in store for me

710
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:59,413
And so much pain
my dazzled eyes refused to see

711
01:19:59,581 --> 01:20:01,515
I ran so fast that time
and youth at last ran out

712
01:20:01,682 --> 01:20:03,317
He wrote that for you, Zac.

713
01:20:03,484 --> 01:20:05,819
Yesterday the moon was blue

714
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:10,190
And every crazy day brought
something new to do

715
01:20:10,358 --> 01:20:13,092
I used my magic age
as if it were a wand

716
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,763
And never saw the waste
and emptiness beyond

717
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:21,201
The game of love I played
with arrogance and pride

718
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:25,204
And every flame I lit
too quickly quickly died

719
01:20:25,372 --> 01:20:28,841
The friends I made all
seemed somehow to drift away

720
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:32,846
And only I am left on stage
to end the play

721
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:36,350
There are so many songs
in me that won't be sung

722
01:20:36,516 --> 01:20:40,519
I feel the bitter taste of tears
upon my tongue

723
01:20:40,688 --> 01:20:45,292
The time has come for me
to pay for yesterday

724
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:51,864
When I was young

725
01:20:59,261 --> 01:21:00,895
Happy birthday, my man!

726
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,764
The old man's still got it, huh?

727
01:21:10,671 --> 01:21:13,473
It's been a while since
I've seen him with an inhaler.

728
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:17,011
He got rid of it.

729
01:21:18,346 --> 01:21:19,846
Since when?

730
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:23,518
- Almost a year, I think.
- He didn't tell us?

731
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:27,121
I said nothing, okay?

732
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:37,030
I don't know about cake.

733
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:39,534
I overate.

734
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:41,368
We've got news.

735
01:21:41,537 --> 01:21:44,872
I don't want to steal your thunder,
bro, so I'll be quick.

736
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:46,541
We're getting married.

737
01:21:50,378 --> 01:21:53,146
You hear that?!
They're getting married!

738
01:21:54,983 --> 01:21:56,217
I'm very happy!

739
01:21:56,385 --> 01:21:58,418
This calls for another bottle!

740
01:21:59,954 --> 01:22:01,021
Congratulations.

741
01:22:03,492 --> 01:22:05,458
How about a double wedding, honey?

742
01:22:05,627 --> 01:22:07,595
Sit down and shut up.

743
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,663
You look like a damn fool.

744
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,411
What's the matter?

745
01:22:25,846 --> 01:22:27,347
What's going on?

746
01:22:32,054 --> 01:22:33,621
Tell him to go to hell.

747
01:22:33,788 --> 01:22:35,855
Shut up, fag.

748
01:22:36,057 --> 01:22:37,757
You shut up.

749
01:22:39,427 --> 01:22:42,762
You seem to be sniffing a lot
for someone in detox.

750
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,531
Did I miss something?

751
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,001
Two subjects had become taboo
at home:

752
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,001
me,

753
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:50,304
and Raymond.
- Sucking cock's made you a prick?

754
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:51,871
That's enough!

755
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,609
Your ass must've been raw
after prison.

756
01:22:54,775 --> 01:23:00,847
He'd done a year for beating up
a junkie who tried to steal his coke.

757
01:23:01,783 --> 01:23:03,217
You'd have enjoyed that, huh?

758
01:23:03,385 --> 01:23:05,119
That's quite enough!

759
01:23:05,953 --> 01:23:06,920
It's Christmas!

760
01:23:07,088 --> 01:23:08,788
Can't we eat in peace?!

761
01:23:17,565 --> 01:23:19,367
Idiots!

762
01:24:29,136 --> 01:24:30,470
How sweet life was

763
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,440
since I had become
so happy and fulfilled.

764
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,291
Aw, Mom!

765
01:25:27,962 --> 01:25:29,462
Yeah, that's right.

766
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:34,135
Don't call me back
to say she's stopped bleeding.

767
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:36,136
She'll stop anyway,

768
01:25:36,304 --> 01:25:38,139
whether or not I think of her.

769
01:25:52,154 --> 01:25:54,155
If I truly had a gift,

770
01:25:54,322 --> 01:25:56,824
by dint of being his instrument,

771
01:25:56,992 --> 01:25:59,527
perhaps he would one day
answer my prayers.

772
01:26:12,974 --> 01:26:15,141
Had I known,
I wouldn't have come today.

773
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,612
I think...

774
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:20,613
you won't come much anymore.

775
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,019
He says it's just
for a couple of weeks.

776
01:26:25,186 --> 01:26:27,188
Just long enough
to get back on his feet.

777
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:29,355
To run through our savings,
you mean.

778
01:26:29,524 --> 01:26:32,193
Anyway, he seems determined.
I've never seen him like that.

779
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:35,862
I think, this time, he really wants
to clean up his act.

780
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:40,367
Please, make an effort.
Your brother needs help.

781
01:26:41,536 --> 01:26:43,203
So Michelle's well, then?

782
01:26:44,206 --> 01:26:45,538
Yeah.

783
01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:47,208
I brought your records back.

784
01:26:50,045 --> 01:26:52,880
- Coffee?
- It's okay, Mom, I'll do it.

785
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,817
What's new?

786
01:26:56,984 --> 01:26:59,052
Not much.
Classes, work.

787
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,654
So, were they a hit?

788
01:27:01,823 --> 01:27:04,124
Your brother's playing
my old records at his club.

789
01:27:04,292 --> 01:27:05,960
Can you believe it?

790
01:27:08,997 --> 01:27:11,164
If that's the nutcase,
I'm not here.

791
01:27:14,336 --> 01:27:16,837
No, he's busy.
Can he call you back?

792
01:27:17,005 --> 01:27:18,137
That her?

793
01:27:23,177 --> 01:27:24,677
It was for Yvan.

794
01:27:29,184 --> 01:27:31,018
Is Doris the "nutcase"?

795
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:36,356
She was nuts to put up with you
for six years, that's for sure!

796
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:51,405
I'm sorry, Mom.

797
01:27:53,073 --> 01:27:55,074
I'll be out of your hair soon.

798
01:27:57,078 --> 01:27:58,946
I missed...

799
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:01,681
your delicious ironed toast.

800
01:28:05,353 --> 01:28:07,154
I love you, Mom.

801
01:28:14,529 --> 01:28:16,030
Any bacon left?

802
01:28:17,364 --> 01:28:19,032
Well, I'll be going.

803
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,533
Already?

804
01:28:21,703 --> 01:28:23,571
- Need a ride back?
- Never mind, Dad.

805
01:28:23,738 --> 01:28:24,939
I'll go.

806
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,273
Coming?

807
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:33,447
It's disco?

808
01:28:33,614 --> 01:28:34,948
Not just disco.

809
01:28:35,115 --> 01:28:36,783
I play a bit of everything.

810
01:28:36,952 --> 01:28:38,452
Anything unusual.

811
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:43,123
I'll come see you at some point.
I'll make an exception.

812
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:46,293
I don't drink anymore,
so I avoid bars.

813
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:51,966
I don't drink, smoke
or swear anymore.

814
01:28:52,132 --> 01:28:55,135
Fuck, I left my bag of weed
at the pub.

815
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:00,140
You can drop me at the corner.

816
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:06,546
Listen...

817
01:29:11,252 --> 01:29:14,088
I know I haven't always been
cool with you.

818
01:29:18,259 --> 01:29:19,760
I need money.

819
01:29:21,429 --> 01:29:25,431
I'll pay you back. I don't know
when, but I swear I will.

820
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,101
You're asking me?

821
01:29:27,268 --> 01:29:30,770
The old man brags that his little
pet makes more than he does.

822
01:29:30,939 --> 01:29:32,606
If he's got a pet,
it sure isn't me.

823
01:29:32,774 --> 01:29:34,942
Don't be a prick, I'm in a jam.

824
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:38,778
Even if I was a millionaire,
I wouldn't lend you a dime.

825
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:50,957
Antoine and Christian did.
Even Fatty spotted me 20.

826
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:54,127
Come on!

827
01:29:54,962 --> 01:29:57,730
Do I have to give you a blow job?

828
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:10,978
That's it, go kill yourself.

829
01:30:40,341 --> 01:30:41,842
Aren't you in bed yet?

830
01:30:45,046 --> 01:30:46,012
Here.

831
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,514
Someone left this for you tonight.

832
01:30:52,686 --> 01:30:54,020
G'night.

833
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:14,440
You want to get things hopping,
give this tape to the DJ.

834
01:31:14,609 --> 01:31:17,911
- Do I have to wear this?
- I want this off, too.

835
01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:21,414
Bunch of nitwits. A tux
without a bow tie isn't a tux.

836
01:31:21,582 --> 01:31:24,083
We're all dressed the same.
That's the beauty of it. Huh?

837
01:31:24,252 --> 01:31:25,753
Very nice.

838
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:28,421
Where have you been?

839
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,591
Fatty.

840
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:36,596
- Goddammit, Raymond!
- I'll pay you back.

841
01:31:41,269 --> 01:31:42,569
Congratulations.

842
01:31:49,743 --> 01:31:51,277
Aren't you going to introduce us?

843
01:31:52,613 --> 01:31:54,113
My mother.

844
01:31:54,282 --> 01:31:55,615
My brothers.

845
01:31:55,783 --> 01:31:57,518
My father. Min.

846
01:31:57,685 --> 01:31:59,119
What's that?

847
01:31:59,287 --> 01:32:00,621
Min.

848
01:32:36,256 --> 01:32:38,090
He takes after his old man!

849
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:16,263
Is that idiot gonna play my tape
or what?

850
01:33:32,313 --> 01:33:33,313
Not dancing?

851
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,648
I'm waiting for my song.

852
01:33:35,817 --> 01:33:37,818
By popular request...

853
01:33:43,925 --> 01:33:45,859
Shall we go smoke one outside?

854
01:33:46,027 --> 01:33:47,493
Good idea.

855
01:33:48,997 --> 01:33:52,499
You two go ahead.
Michelle and I will have girl talk.

856
01:34:25,033 --> 01:34:27,034
What is it?

857
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:36,009
Your girlfriend's nice.

858
01:34:39,846 --> 01:34:41,347
She's cute, too.

859
01:34:46,186 --> 01:34:47,954
You want a shotgun?

860
01:35:58,393 --> 01:35:59,592
A coke.

861
01:36:01,328 --> 01:36:02,561
Same.

862
01:36:07,335 --> 01:36:09,002
I'm very proud of you.

863
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,877
What's so funny?

864
01:36:24,152 --> 01:36:25,551
Check those two out.

865
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,989
Little Zac sure seems
to like his cousin.

866
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:31,391
Talk about keeping it
in the family!

867
01:36:31,559 --> 01:36:33,726
He's not after his cousin,
but her boyfriend.

868
01:36:33,895 --> 01:36:37,731
I saw them French-kissing
in the parking lot earlier.

869
01:36:39,067 --> 01:36:40,434
So it's true.

870
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,701
Junior's a fag.

871
01:36:42,869 --> 01:36:44,403
Looks like it.

872
01:36:52,913 --> 01:36:54,346
Ah, damn.

873
01:37:33,621 --> 01:37:35,122
Don't touch me!

874
01:37:38,259 --> 01:37:40,127
Are you okay?

875
01:37:48,802 --> 01:37:49,903
Keep dancing.

876
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:52,471
Just a little misunderstanding.

877
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,141
The wedding goes on.
Keep dancing.

878
01:37:54,307 --> 01:37:55,641
No, everything's okay.

879
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:57,310
Keep dancing!

880
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,251
Christian!

881
01:38:07,721 --> 01:38:08,954
I'm sorry!

882
01:38:13,293 --> 01:38:14,627
What's going on?!

883
01:38:14,795 --> 01:38:16,128
Stop!

884
01:38:17,965 --> 01:38:19,798
Give us a minute?

885
01:38:25,305 --> 01:38:27,039
On your brother's wedding day!

886
01:38:28,643 --> 01:38:30,743
Raymond causes trouble
and I get in shit?

887
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:33,113
What happened was your fault.
Your brother was defending you.

888
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,814
You were being called a fag!

889
01:38:36,984 --> 01:38:39,986
They saw you in the parking lot
with your cousin's boyfriend!

890
01:38:41,655 --> 01:38:43,122
What did they see?

891
01:38:45,993 --> 01:38:48,161
It's not what you think.

892
01:38:51,498 --> 01:38:52,998
We were smoking a joint.

893
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:55,235
We just gave each other a shotgun.

894
01:38:58,005 --> 01:39:00,539
You're a born liar.

895
01:39:01,074 --> 01:39:02,775
Nothing happened!

896
01:39:02,944 --> 01:39:04,945
Be a man for once in your life

897
01:39:05,112 --> 01:39:07,213
and tell the truth!

898
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:10,282
What do you want to hear?!

899
01:39:11,284 --> 01:39:12,786
That I'm gay?!

900
01:39:12,953 --> 01:39:14,119
A fag?!

901
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:15,854
That I suck cock?!

902
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:20,659
Yes, something happened,
but not with him!

903
01:39:21,328 --> 01:39:22,728
You know with who.

904
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:27,500
Nothing happened earlier.

905
01:39:27,667 --> 01:39:30,536
But I would've fucking loved it
if something had!

906
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:34,274
Fucking right!

907
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:47,119
Go.

908
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:49,989
Go away!

909
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,321
Forgive me, Mom.

910
01:41:28,488 --> 01:41:30,489
I know you'll be sad I'm gone.

911
01:41:30,658 --> 01:41:33,526
But I know you'll be glad
to know where I am.

912
01:41:33,694 --> 01:41:35,495
Don't worry.

913
01:41:35,662 --> 01:41:37,830
Your God is watching over me.

914
01:41:37,997 --> 01:41:40,833
Raymond made me realize something
the other day:

915
01:41:41,001 --> 01:41:43,136
I've never told you I love you.

916
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:57,684
This side trip to the Holy Land,
before Europe,

917
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:59,519
would make her ecstatic.

918
01:42:03,323 --> 01:42:06,125
Walking in Christ's footsteps
certainly intrigued me...

919
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:10,964
but I hadn't crossed the Atlantic

920
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:13,132
out of Catholic faith.

921
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:14,613
Zac, are you there?

922
01:45:18,953 --> 01:45:20,453
I love you, sweetheart!

923
01:49:54,828 --> 01:49:58,164
God works in mysterious ways,
my mother always said.

924
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,248
The good Lord brought you back.
It's a sign.

925
01:50:53,753 --> 01:50:55,587
You'll heal him.

926
01:51:20,113 --> 01:51:22,081
Thanks for coming, Christian.

927
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,761
I'm so happy you're staying.

928
01:51:38,931 --> 01:51:40,765
I want to know everything.

929
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,171
Dad coming down?

930
01:51:47,106 --> 01:51:48,606
He's in bed already.

931
01:51:49,775 --> 01:51:51,609
- Good night.
- Good night.

932
01:52:02,555 --> 01:52:04,556
I found him lying there,

933
01:52:04,725 --> 01:52:06,726
with a syringe in his arm.

934
01:52:18,939 --> 01:52:22,307
I think it'll be a while
before I get that 20 back.

935
01:52:25,112 --> 01:52:26,112
What?

936
01:52:27,613 --> 01:52:29,948
You lost that 20 long ago.

937
01:52:33,453 --> 01:52:35,788
If you ask me,
it was no accident.

938
01:53:55,301 --> 01:53:57,802
He'll pull through.
He's tough.

939
01:54:04,243 --> 01:54:06,244
I know I'm not a perfect father.

940
01:54:08,081 --> 01:54:11,417
You certainly wouldn't have
the problems you do otherwise.

941
01:54:12,252 --> 01:54:13,919
Raymond, either.

942
01:54:15,588 --> 01:54:18,423
I'm trying to understand
what's happening to us now...

943
01:54:18,591 --> 01:54:20,091
It's not easy.

944
01:54:25,431 --> 01:54:27,932
I know I'm partly to blame.

945
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:33,104
I'd like to redeem myself,

946
01:54:33,273 --> 01:54:35,106
but I don't know how.

947
01:54:37,777 --> 01:54:40,112
I don't know what to tell you...

948
01:54:40,279 --> 01:54:43,414
to make you understand
you're not what you think.

949
01:54:51,757 --> 01:54:55,094
You can't forsake
life's greatest pleasure -

950
01:54:56,429 --> 01:54:57,930
having children.

951
01:55:00,432 --> 01:55:02,568
There's nothing more beautiful...

952
01:55:02,735 --> 01:55:04,068
more powerful.

953
01:55:05,037 --> 01:55:08,373
And that really hits home
when you come close...

954
01:55:08,542 --> 01:55:10,042
to losing one.

955
01:55:12,378 --> 01:55:13,546
Because...

956
01:55:16,216 --> 01:55:18,050
there's no greater pain.

957
01:55:27,159 --> 01:55:30,662
The good Lord must surely
be trying to tell me something.

958
01:55:38,572 --> 01:55:41,239
If you think it's a lost cause...

959
01:55:42,742 --> 01:55:44,810
that you can't change...

960
01:55:51,217 --> 01:55:53,551
I can't accept that.

961
01:55:55,555 --> 01:55:56,989
I can't.

962
01:57:34,354 --> 01:57:36,021
I'm sorry.

963
01:58:23,403 --> 01:58:24,737
Speaking.

964
01:58:28,742 --> 01:58:30,409
Oh, my God.

965
01:58:30,577 --> 01:58:31,909
Oh, no.

966
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:47,760
Even in the face of death,
we have faith that life goes on,

967
01:58:47,926 --> 01:58:49,260
for it comes from God.

968
01:58:49,429 --> 01:58:52,597
It is to him
that we now turn in prayer.

969
01:58:55,868 --> 01:58:57,536
Our Father

970
01:58:57,703 --> 01:58:59,036
Who art in heaven

971
01:58:59,204 --> 01:59:00,538
Hallowed be thy name

972
01:59:00,707 --> 01:59:02,341
Thy kingdom come

973
01:59:02,509 --> 01:59:05,277
They will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

974
01:59:05,444 --> 01:59:06,911
Give us this day

975
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:08,447
Our daily bread

976
01:59:08,614 --> 01:59:09,947
And forgive us our trespasses

977
01:59:10,115 --> 01:59:12,150
As we forgive those
who trespass against us

978
01:59:12,318 --> 01:59:15,621
And lead us not into temptation

979
01:59:15,788 --> 01:59:17,523
But deliver us from evil

980
01:59:47,886 --> 01:59:49,454
You spoke well.

981
01:59:50,457 --> 01:59:52,791
I was deeply... touched.

982
02:00:27,827 --> 02:00:29,161
Ciao, bro.

983
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:36,167
See ya, kid.

984
02:00:38,671 --> 02:00:39,671
Mr. Beaulieu...

985
02:00:39,838 --> 02:00:41,840
You'll come visit us, hmm?

986
02:01:08,768 --> 02:01:10,101
Bye, Dad.

987
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:12,437
Take care of yourself.
Mom, too.

988
02:03:05,851 --> 02:03:09,520
I don't know if it was Raymond's
passing, or if time heals all wounds,

989
02:03:09,689 --> 02:03:13,358
but my father had become
my father once more.

990
02:03:13,525 --> 02:03:15,726
Although it took him 10 years

991
02:03:15,895 --> 02:03:17,696
to allow me into his home
with a lover.

992
02:03:17,863 --> 02:03:21,699
And we've never mentioned
our differences since.

993
02:03:22,234 --> 02:03:24,368
Nor Patsy Cline.

994
02:04:45,551 --> 02:04:48,120
