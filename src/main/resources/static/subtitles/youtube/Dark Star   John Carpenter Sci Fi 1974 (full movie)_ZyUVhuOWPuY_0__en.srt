657
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:44,230
exist it is intuitively obvious

658
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:47,260
intuition is no proof what concrete

659
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:54,189
evidence do you have that you exist hmm

660
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:56,530
well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore I am that's good</font>

661
01:12:54,189 --> 01:12:59,049
that's very good but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

662
01:12:56,529 --> 01:13:02,590
that anything else exists my sensory

663

664
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:09,400
fun now listen listen here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big</font>

665
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:11,529
question how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that the</font>

666
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:21,729
evidence your sensory apparatus reveals

667
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:24,009
to you is correct the guy God God the

668
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:25,689

hit the box a little stock to the bomb

675
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:46,590
you're a bad job you'll save it you

676
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:50,039
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what I'm getting at is this</font>

677
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:51,840
the only experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is directly</font>

678
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:55,050
available to you is your sensory data

679
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:57,029
and this sensory data is merely a stream

680
01:13:55,050 --> 01:14:00,090
of electrical impulses that stimulates

01:13:57,029 --> 01:14:01,619
your computing<font color="#CCCCCC"> center in other words all</font>

682
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,909
that I really know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the outside</font>

world is related to me through my

684
01:14:02,909 --> 01:14:10,529
electrical connections exactly why that

685
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:12,270
would mean that i really don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

686
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:14,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside universe is like at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all for</font>

691
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,970
let's put the gun back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:25,970
you're doing

695
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:35,470
too far away for shipping will be safe

696
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:39,909
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> not give me the gun you don't know</font>

697
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:44,500
what you're doing here you could have

killed me<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm no bomb consider this next</font>

699
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:51,579
question very carefully what is your one

01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:53,710
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> in life to explode of course you</font>

701
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:55,840
can only do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> once right that is</font>

702
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:57,939
correct you wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explode on</font>

703
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,489
the basis of false data with you of

704
01:14:57,939 --> 01:15:02,349
course not well then you've already

705
01:15:00,488 --> 01:15:03,789
admitted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no real proof of</font>

706
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:07,090
the existence of the outside universe

707
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:08,949
yes well where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no absolute</font>

708
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:11,289
proof that sergeant feedback what did

709
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:13,599
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me I recall distinctly the</font>

710
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:15,369
detonation order my memory is good on

711
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,020
matters like these of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font>

712
01:15:15,369 --> 01:15:18,430
remember it but but all you're

713
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,230
remembering is merely a series of

714
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:22,570
sensory impulses which you now realize

715
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:25,779
have no real definite connection with

716
01:15:22,569 --> 01:15:27,159
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> my reality true but since this</font>

717
01:15:25,779 --> 01:15:34,750
is so i have no proof that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

718
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:36,909
really telling me all this that's all

719
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:39,310
beside the point I mean the concept is

720
01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:41,769
valid amount of where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> originates hmm</font>

721
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:43,090
so if you detonate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 seconds you'll</font>

722
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,550
cut me doing so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the base of the</font>
