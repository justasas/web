1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,065


2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,065
Are we still partners?

3
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,611
We've been business partners
for 155 weeks now.

4
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:32,280
We're sitting next to each other
for the first time today.

5
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,741
We seldom see each other.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,120
I know too well that man
can hardly control his passion.

7
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,788
Partners should never get
emotionally involved with each other.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,625
FALLEN ANGELS

9
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:23,219
A message for 3662.

10
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,430
I'm meeting his friends tomorrow.

11
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,683
Ask him to let me know where.

12
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,786
Most people work from 9:00 to 5:00.

13
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,538
I'mjust the opposite.

14
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,666
Myjob is simple.

15
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,129
I visit some "friends"
once in a while.

16
00:04:57,254 --> 00:05:00,007
I don't know any ofthem.

17
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,884
And i'm not interested
in them either.

18
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,637
Because they'll soon be gone forever.

19
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,284
Going out?

20
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,661
Yes.

21
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,793
One's profession is very often
determined by one's personality.

22
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,338
The best thing about my profession

23
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,298
is there's no need
to make any decisions.

24
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,218
Who's to die, when, where-

25
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,138
it's all been planned by others.

26
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,889
I'm a lazy person.

27
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:16,183
I like people to arrange things for me.

28
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,811
That's why i need a partner.

29
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,136
Ming?

30
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,514
Ming!

31
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,851
You're Ming, aren't you?

32
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,395
Remember me?
My name's Hoi.

33
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,358
Don't you remember me?
I was always number one in grade school.

34
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,817
- Remember?
- Yeah.

35
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,152
What a coincidence!

36
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,822
If my Mercedes hadn't broken down,
I wouldn't have run into you here.

37
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:20,034
Every person has his own past.

38
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,745
Even ifyou're a killer,

39
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,204
you still have classmates
from grade school around.

40
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,956
Every time i run into them,

41
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,751
they ask me the same questions.

42
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,297
What kind ofwork do you do?

43
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,716
Give me your card
so we can keep in touch.

44
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:37,760
Maybe we could work together.

45
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,596
That would be great.
Always lookin' to make a buck.

46
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,978
Your own business?
That's worth breaking your back for!

47
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,897
You married?

48
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,733
Don't tell me you can't find a girl!

49
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,735
What? A son!

50
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,863
Looks exactly like you!

51
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,408
What's this-yourwife's black?

52
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:04,328
I mean... smart move!
Black grows on you.

53
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,581
Your skin color's different,

54
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,792
but you make a nice couple.

55
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,251
Hey, are you insured?

56
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,087
Maybe you can help me out.

57
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,215
I've been in the business
over ten years.

58
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,591
You might not know,

59
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,553
but I'm rated the top insurance broker
in all Southeast Asia.

60
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,557
i'm being interviewed
by the newspaper in a few days.

61
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,851
For old time's sake,

62
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:33,400
I'll work out the best plan foryou.
You never can tell.

63
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,068
God forbid, but what if
something should happen?

64
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,946
It's notjust foryou.

65
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,615
I see you travel a lot for work.

66
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,701
If not foryourself,
think about your wife and little boy.

67
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:48,497
I often wonder ifany insurance company
would insure a professional killer.

68
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,582
I'd really like to help him out,

69
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,918
but i wouldn't know
whom to name as beneficiary.

70
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,630
Remember that girl with the big boobs?
The one we were both afteryears ago?

71
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,967
We're getting married next week.
Here's an invitation.

72
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,055
Sorry—just write your own name on it.

73
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:07,474
Come a little early.
I'll write up the policy foryou.

74
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,394
And bring your wife.
Bye-bye.

75
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:15,316
A fewyears back, i paid a black woman
$30 to have her picture taken with me,

76
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,653
so that ifpeople asked,
I could say she was my wife.

77
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:22,197
And the kid in the picture—
I just bought him an ice-cream cone.

78
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:26,326
I've always wanted to go
to a wedding,

79
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,999
but i know very well
it's not my kind ofscene.

80
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:29,533
Going through a person's trash

81
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,745
can tell you a lot about them.

82
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,207
He comes to this bar a lot.

83
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,003
Maybe 'cause it's quiet.

84
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,799
Sometimes i sit in his usual seat.

85
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,888
Lets me feel close to him.

86
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,980
Some people you really don't want
to get too close to.

87
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,360
Find out too much about a person
and you lose interest.

88
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,701
I'm the practical kind.

89
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:15,037
I know how to make myself happy.

90
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,607
No, he hasn't come backyet.

91
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,067
You telling the truth?

92
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,653
Why should I lie?

93
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:03,074
- You live here?
- Something wrong with that?

94
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,868
Have you seen this person around?

95
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,453
No.

96
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,426
Don't come out yet.

97
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,552
The cops are still here.

98
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:37,984
You know where he is. Tell us.

99
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,030
You rub elbows
with a lot of people every day.

100
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,991
Some strangers might become
your friends or even confidants.

101
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,122
But I know very well these cops
will never be my confidants.

102
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,708
My name is Ho Chi Moo.

103
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,794
I was prisoner number 223.

104
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,798
I haven't seen him in days.
I'll let you know when he comes back.

105
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,676
I saw him come in.
You'd better tell the truth.

106
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,723
Stop making faces!
Stand still!

107
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,203
I'm a happy man.

108
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,373
I was very talkative when i was small.

109
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,544
But at age five, i ate
a can of pineapple that had expired,

110
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,879
and i stopped talking.

111
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,426
For that reason,
I have very few friends.

112
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,846
I found it very hard
to find work too.

113
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,764
I finally decided to be my own boss.

114
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,869
Having no capital,
the only thing i can do

115
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,122
is sneak into
other people's shops after hours

116
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,540
and run my own business.

117
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,876
I'm not a freeloader.

118
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:21,797
i just think it makes sense,
since the rent's already been paid,

119
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,798
to run the business around the clock.

120
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:26,551
Who says nobody
buys pork at 3:00 a.m.?

121
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,763
I came yesterday
to buy some, didn't i?

122
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:30,805
Ifyou want to do business,

123
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,099
you have to take
each customer's needs into account.

124
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:38,147
Buddha said,
"If I don't descend into hell, who will?"

125
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,106
When you're the boss,
you have to be kind,

126
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:41,692
caring and tolerant.

127
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:43,943
You can'tjust look to your own gain.

128
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,365
I know very well
there's no such thing as a free lunch,

129
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,160
so i always work very hard
until the wee hours.

130
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:54,829
I don't make a lot of money,
but I'm happy.

131
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,849
Are you nuts? Why should i let you
wash my clothes?

132
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,936
I'm a beggar.
I don't need laundry done!

133
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:19,312
I don't need it!

134
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,648
Leave me alone!

135
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,734
Are you nuts?
Keep your hands off my clothes!

136
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,196
Give me back my clothes!

137
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,739
Hands off!
I'll beat you up!

138
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,491
Okay, I'll pay!

139
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:35,538
I'll payyou,
if it's moneyyou want.

140
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:37,163
You're a lunatic!

141
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,336
Don't push me!
I don't want any eggplant!

142
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:44,421
You can't make me buy it!

143
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,217
I'm single.
What would people think?

144
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,677
Not even ifthey're free!

145
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,679
I'll take some melon.

146
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:55,641
Here!

147
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:04,357
This is huge!
Are you out ofyour mind?

148
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:08,570
Stop that!

149
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:13,032
I washed my hairyesterday.

150
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:21,250
Ouch! Easy!

151
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,378
My head doesn't itch—
stop scratching it!

152
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,674
I just came down for a late snack.

153
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,926
I don't need a shampoo.

154
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,392
I give up.
Do whateveryou want.

155
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,231
No!

156
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,819
I don't want a shave!

157
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,621
Hands off!

158
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,003
Listen, i'm no regular guy.
I have underworld connections.

159
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,844
I really don't want a shave.
How about—

160
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,430
I'll payyou, okay?

161
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,186
A double cone, please.

162
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,940
Oh, no, it's you!

163
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,857
Sorry.

164
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:41,663
Stop pulling my hair.

165
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:44,290
I'll climb in myself.

166
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:48,294
Sorry!

167
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,132
I'm coming in.

168
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:03,101
Hello? It's me.
What are you doing?

169
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,314
Go to bed. Don't wait for me.

170
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:12,318
I'm having some ice cream.

171
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:17,115
Uh, no, it's more than a scoop or two.

172
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:20,994
I don't know how much more
i'll have to eat.

173
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:26,041
No, it's not an eating contest.
Ofcourse I'll have to pay!

174
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,257
Yeah, but this guy won't let me...

175
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:36,844
I don't know how to explain,
but it's the truth.

176
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,931
Come see foryourself
ifyou don't believe me.

177
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,599
Hello?

178
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:50,273
No, i can't eat that!

179
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:56,279
What if my mustache catches on fire?

180
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,616
This isn't funny anymore.

181
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:05,371
Why are you doing this?

182
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,208
I said to come byyourself.

183
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,543
I didn't tell you
to bring the whole family.

184
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:13,963
Dad's too old for all this ice cream.

185
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:16,383
What ifsomething happens?

186
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,428
The kids have to go to school tomorrow.

187
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,057
Think about that.

188
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:33,233
Has anyone in Hong Kong ever died
from too much ice cream?

189
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,444
I don't want to be the first.

190
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:39,781
I'll payyou, okay?

191
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:44,535
Name a price.
I'll buy it all. Please.

192
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,584
My ice cream may be
a bit more expensive,

193
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,504
but i think this family
is having a great time.

194
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,257
i love ice cream.

195
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,345
When i was little, an ice cream truck
would stop by my house every day.

196
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,597
I was always happy to see it.

197
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,269
Once i asked my dad
why he didn't drive an ice cream truck.

198
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,980
He didn't answer.

199
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:13,648
I later found out

200
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,442
my mother had been run over
by an ice cream truck.

201
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,655
i was born in Taiwan.

202
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,533
i came to Hong Kong
with my dad when i was five.

203
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,703
He worked as an assistant
at the Chungking Mansions Hotel.

204
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,290
He's rarely talked
since my mother died.

205
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,334
No more ice cream, ofcourse.

206
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,881
Maybe the fact
we're both so quiet

207
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,551
explains why we've always been close.

208
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,972
Why are you being so nice to me?

209
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:47,974
You even bought me ice cream.

210
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,352
You should know
I don't like ice cream.

211
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:10,913
It's too cold!

212
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:13,666
It's bad for my health.
Gives me the runs.

213
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,515
Are you nuts?

214
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,491
Hey, open up!
What game are you playing now?

215
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,701
Open this door!

216
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:51,747
What are you doing?

217
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,166
I'll kill you!

218
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,043
Open this door!
Stop playing around!

219
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,727
9090.

220
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,563
I'd like to leave a message.

221
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,066
I'm meeting his friends tomorrow.

222
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,652
He should let me know where.

223
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:08,634
I get it. It's clear.

224
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:14,013
I just wanna make sure
the address was correct.

225
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,099
It was a fast-food store,
not a barber shop.

226
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,854
You may think
we must be making a lot of money.

227
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,481
But how much is a human life worth?

228
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,317
Demand comes and goes.

229
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,028
it's not unusual to have
no business for months.

230
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:29,987
So, once in a while

231
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,658
I moonlight in the financial field.

232
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,035
Like debt collection.

233
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,243
Thanks.

234
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,792
Hold on.
I'll get you the money.

235
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,131
Here.

236
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,313
I don't know why,
but I've been injured a lot lately.

237
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,358
I hate digging bullets
out ofmy own body.

238
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,028
It's exhausting.

239
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,037
I turned in early that night,

240
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,706
knowing when i woke up the next day,
i'd have to make a decision.

241
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,681
Lady, we're closed.

242
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:06,936
Two weeks after I was injured,
I asked to see her.

243
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,523
I wanted to tell her my decision.

244
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,860
But i didn't show up.

245
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:41,428
I'm sure she'll look for me here
in the next couple days.

246
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,432
i know that because
we've been partners for so long.

247
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,858
As her partner, it's not enough
for me to understand her.

248
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,987
I have to let her understand me too.

249
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,240
So sometimes i leave clues

250
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,994
so she can trace
my actions and whereabouts.

251
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,541
She's become part ofmy life
these past years.

252
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,425
But things always change.

253
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,889
I desperately want to tell her
that i want to quit,

254
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:26,349
but I don't know how to start.

255
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:31,103
So i've devised another way.

256
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,153
A woman may come asking for me
in the next few days.

257
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,906
Please give her this coin.

258
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,617
Tell her 1 81 8 is my lucky number.

259
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,380
1 81 8.

260
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:00,174
The number ofone
ofthe songs in thisjukebox.

261
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,178
When she hears the song,

262
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,262
she'll understand my message.

263
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,452
Forget him

264
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,625
And it's like forgetting everything

265
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:39,005
It's like losing all direction

266
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,009
Losing oneself

267
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:48,305
Forget him

268
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:53,103
And it's like forgetting
thejoy of life

269
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:58,650
It's like a knife in the heart

270
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:02,236
Bleeding in pain

271
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,003
May i sit here?

272
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,744
It's raining!

273
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,748
Let's have some fun!

274
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:56,623
It feels great!

275
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,252
Cover me too!

276
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,088
Come on!

277
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,855
What?

278
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,565
I'm all nervous.

279
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,108
Why?

280
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,487
Come on up.

281
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,822
No?

282
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,825
Okay.

283
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,706
Sure you don't wanna come up?

284
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,376
Positive?

285
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:41,293
Forget it.

286
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,844
Come and get it.

287
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,985
It won't dry out tonight.
You'll have to stay.

288
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:10,823
I'll take it to the cleaners
foryou tomorrow.

289
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,199
Okay?

290
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:17,204
Hey, I'm talking to you.

291
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,750
Why are you ignoring me?

292
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,505
Open the door!

293
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,514
Looks nice.
Still fits you well.

294
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,518
Whose is this?

295
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,770
Why all the questions?

296
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,190
Are we that close?

297
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,025
Better be careful!

298
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,533
What are you doing?

299
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,916
Help!

300
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:06,463
Hey!

301
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:09,047
What do you want from me?

302
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:27,399
What are you doing?

303
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,905
I'm so happy!

304
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:34,406
Don't let me stop you.

305
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,847
Guess why i dyed my hair blond.

306
00:42:00,391 --> 00:42:01,433
I don't know.

307
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,855
To make myself unforgettable.

308
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:08,315
It's pretty special.

309
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,942
You're making fun of me.

310
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,778
I mean it.
You're very special.

311
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,740
- Someone told me that once before.
- Who?

312
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,662
You!

313
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,456
We were together for some time.

314
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,084
I had long hair then.

315
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,128
You called me "baby."

316
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:32,005
Really?

317
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:35,300
Yes.

318
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,431
But let's let bygones be bygones.

319
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,017
Ifyou like me now, it's fine.

320
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,774
I didn't say that.

321
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,693
I just wanted some company.

322
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:55,195
Fine.

323
00:42:55,655 --> 00:42:57,447
Just for the night.

324
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:01,536
Maybe you'll like me better tomorrow.

325
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,581
No!

326
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,250
Get out!

327
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:39,045
Get the hell out of here!

328
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,048
Get out or I'll clobberyou!

329
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,392
Hello?

330
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:57,563
What did you want to tell me?

331
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,733
You want to have kids?

332
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,402
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:08,824
You wanna get married?
Sure! I'll marryyou.

334
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:12,702
Give me time
to send out invitations.

335
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,914
You already did?

336
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:17,250
How come I'm the last to know?

337
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,960
You're a sly one!

338
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,631
You sent me an invitation?

339
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,508
Why?

340
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,518
i see.
Congratulations!

341
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:37,727
Who's the lucky girl?

342
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,398
Blondie?

343
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,860
What a perfect couple!

344
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,655
She wants me to be her bridesmaid?

345
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,782
What should i wear?

346
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,284
Chinese style?

347
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,538
A lady-in-waiting?
How interesting!

348
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,791
Sure! That's great!

349
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,752
Where's Blondie now?

350
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:04,422
I want to call and congratulate her.

351
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:07,757
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

352
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,515
Give me a dime.
You got a dime?

353
00:48:27,945 --> 00:48:29,905
Hello? Blondie?

354
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,242
i know you're there.
Stop pretending you're the machine.

355
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,329
You know what?
Ifyou don't talk to me,

356
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:39,164
you'll regret it
the rest ofyour life!

357
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,166
You're marrying him?

358
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,168
I shouldn't have asked you
to pay his electricity bill.

359
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:44,920
Now you're getting married?

360
00:48:45,713 --> 00:48:48,340
You filthy bitch!
He doesn't love you.

361
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:52,510
Hejust wants a son born
in the Year ofthe Pig— this year!

362
00:48:52,637 --> 00:48:54,387
But it's already April!

363
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,474
There's not enough time!
it'll be premature.

364
00:48:58,851 --> 00:48:59,935
I've got it!

365
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:03,355
You got pregnant by another guy
and told him it's his child.

366
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,485
I'm warning you: Next time i see you,
I'm gonna push you down the stairs!

367
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,944
You got that?

368
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:12,197
Hello? Hello?
I'm not finished yet!

369
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:13,824
Hello?

370
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,034
Gimme another dime!

371
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:27,838
That bitch!
She took the phone offthe hook!

372
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,513
I don't want any!

373
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,767
Let me cry on your shoulder.

374
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:51,737
The night's full ofweirdos.

375
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,242
This girl seems to turn up
wherever i go.

376
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:00,996
I'm fine now.
I'll payyou back next time.

377
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,541
But every time we meet,
it's the same story.

378
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:16,262
I wish I could tell her some problems
can't be solved over the phone.

379
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:18,596
You meet the guy face to face
and talk it out,

380
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,766
or, ifthat fails,
you punch him in the nose.

381
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,601
Too bad i couldn't put it into words.

382
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,023
But she seemed to somehow
understand anyway.

383
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,902
I thinkyou're right.

384
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:33,653
Let's go.

385
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:54,467
Blondie, I know you're in there!

386
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,344
Come out ifyou've got the guts!

387
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,222
I'm gonna burn this place down
on the count ofthree!

388
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:02,974
One... two... three!

389
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:05,643
I think we got the wrong floor.

390
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:09,815
Blondie, come on out!
I know you're in there!

391
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,151
I'm gonna burn this place down
ifyou don't!

392
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:14,320
One... two... three!

393
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,574
Let's try the next floor.

394
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,369
Are those gray hairs real?

395
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,371
At my age? Ofcourse they are!

396
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,041
Looks like a faded blond dyejob to me!
How are you related to Blondie?

397
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,501
I don't know any Blondie.

398
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:31,586
Her real name's Situ Hui Ling.
Ring a bell?

399
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,506
Never heard of her.

400
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:34,798
Is she your chick?

401
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,635
Leave me alone, you loony!

402
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,552
I'm sure they've got a thing together.

403
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:41,346
Follow him!

404
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,598
Do you have a daughter
named Blondie?

405
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:47,478
Or Situ Hui Ling? You look a lot alike.
Have you forgotten?

406
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:49,312
- Think hard.
- I don't know her.

407
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,606
We searched high and low all night.

408
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,402
After a while, i started to wonder
ifshe even knew where Blondie lived.

409
00:51:55,528 --> 00:51:57,487
I'm tired ofthis game.

410
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,784
Why is everyone covering foryou?
Where the hell are you?

411
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:03,911
I'm a nice person.
Why doesn't anyone help me?

412
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:05,870
You're a slut,
and everyone helps you!

413
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,541
It's not fair.
What kind ofworld is this?

414
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,709
I don't wanna play this game anymore.

415
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,753
You must be sleeping with everyone.
You must have slept with her too.

416
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,882
i bet you have,
but you won't admit it. Right?

417
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,094
What a crazy world.
How am I gonna find you?

418
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:22,971
Bitch! You've got
the whole world on your side.

419
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:36,402
Blondie!

420
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,364
You slut! How dare you showyour face!
You're finished!

421
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:44,993
Bitch! Slut! Tramp!

422
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,996
I'll mop you to death!

423
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,664
Bitch!

424
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:55,461
How can you be so cruel!

425
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,929
Hey, get your face out ofthe food
and watch the door!

426
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,682
Blondie could walk in any minute.

427
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:09,559
She used to come here
for dim sum with her pop.

428
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:16,024
How do you spell "inadequate"?

429
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,574
Never mind.
I'll just spell it like this.

430
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,452
Listen to this.

431
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:31,957
"I, Situ Hui Ling, aka Blondie,
am ugly and inadequate.

432
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:35,168
i hereby return Mr.Johnny Kwong
to his rightful girlfriend, Charlie Young.

433
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,296
I will have no more relationship with him.

434
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:40,173
This will serve as proof.
Our signatures are binding unto death."

435
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,801
This is great, right?

436
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:46,387
I'll make Blondie sign this today.

437
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,057
I gotta get her fingerprints
and iD number.

438
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,644
Her old man can serve as witness.
I'll get a picture ofthem together.

439
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,519
Blondie!

440
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:56,190
- Your name is Blondie too?
- Shut up!

441
00:53:56,315 --> 00:53:57,942
I'll fucking chop you to pieces!

442
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,070
This is Blondie!

443
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:02,946
Your name is Blondie too?

444
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:04,614
What if it is?

445
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:09,411
Is your name really Blondie?

446
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:10,620
What of it?

447
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,297
They say women are made ofwater.

448
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,882
So are some men.

449
00:55:04,842 --> 00:55:07,760
Most people fall in love
for the first time as teenagers.

450
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,054
I guess i'm a late bloomer.

451
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:12,849
Maybe i'm too picky.

452
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,184
On May 30, 1 995,

453
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,520
I finally fell in love
for the first time.

454
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,317
It was raining that night.

455
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:26,446
When I looked at her,
I suddenly felt like i was a store.

456
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:28,865
And she was me.

457
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,870
Without any warning,
she suddenly enters the store.

458
00:55:33,454 --> 00:55:35,204
I don't know how long she'll stay.

459
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,750
The longer the better, ofcourse.

460
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:31,362
You never wash
your feet or socks or hair.

461
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,282
You stink all over.

462
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:39,203
When did you dye your hair blond?

463
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,210
They say love can change a man.

464
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:49,005
I started to find myself
more handsome and charming.

465
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,675
And suddenly i discovered
i was turning blond.

466
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,345
Maybe because my mom was Russian.

467
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,807
A lot ofpeople don't understand
when my father speaks Taiwanese.

468
00:57:58,932 --> 00:58:00,726
And rightly so.

469
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:03,644
it's actually Taiwanese
with the infamous Russian accent.

470
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:07,398
Hello?
Chungking Mansions Hotel.

471
00:58:07,733 --> 00:58:09,150
Who's this?

472
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,152
Blondie!

473
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:29,086
On June 22, 1 995,

474
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:33,007
the italian team Sampdoria
came to play in Hong Kong.

475
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,135
I went to the game with Charlie.

476
00:58:35,552 --> 00:58:37,221
She wanted to see Ruud Gullit.

477
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,141
She was ecstatic that night.

478
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,936
She insisted on staying after the game.

479
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:47,647
This is no fun!

480
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,943
What's the point in playing them?

481
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:55,614
They're all blond and superior.
Our players are no match.

482
00:58:57,074 --> 00:59:00,868
Did they really expect a miracle?
Fools!

483
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,792
You know why I came?

484
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:12,756
I was the one hoping for a miracle.

485
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,217
Johnny is a huge fan ofGullit.

486
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,135
I thought I might see him here.

487
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,682
But how could he come?
He's getting married tomorrow.

488
00:59:23,976 --> 00:59:26,769
You know why I was yelling
and waving like crazy earlier?

489
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:30,023
I was hoping he'd see me on TV.

490
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,825
He promised me he'd come!

491
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:42,119
So why didn't he?

492
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:46,831
I realized that she still missedJohnny.

493
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,001
It made me feel bad.

494
00:59:49,126 --> 00:59:51,460
But i'm an optimist.

495
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,465
i've heard people say
everything has its expiration date.

496
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,802
I wasn't sure this would apply
to her andJohnny,

497
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,805
but I thought it might soon.

498
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,530
I guess I might have been
a little too optimistic.

499
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,992
A few days later,
I asked her to go to a second match.

500
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,078
She didn't show up.

501
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,875
i thought what she had
withJohnny would expire soon.

502
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:31,876
But as it turned out,

503
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,503
my expiration date came up first.

504
01:00:38,342 --> 01:00:40,969
i got there early
and stayed till everyone was gone.

505
01:00:41,094 --> 01:00:43,304
As the lights ofthe stadium went dark,

506
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,182
I realized she wasn't gonna show.

507
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:47,976
I was heartbroken.
This couldn't be.

508
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,653
People say breaking up hurts.

509
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,030
That wasn't true for me.

510
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,701
But something strange did happen.

511
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,413
After that day, my blond hair
suddenly disappeared.

512
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,749
Just like my first love.

513
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,671
I also began to realize my past behavior
had been very irresponsible.

514
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:18,673
I shouldn't have taken over
other people's shops,

515
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,259
coming and going as i pleased.

516
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:25,012
Every shop has its own feelings.

517
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:28,349
This realization
had a profound effect on me.

518
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,436
It prompted me to change my ways.

519
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:48,161
Welcome.

520
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,496
One person.

521
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:56,127
Look for our new menu next time.

522
01:01:56,253 --> 01:01:58,003
Am i making you stay overtime?

523
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,092
Get a glass foryourself.
Be my guest.

524
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,437
How's business?

525
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:29,702
What's it cost
to open a place like this?

526
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,346
Good evening.

527
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,349
You have money?

528
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:56,771
i wasjust wondering
what it costs to open a place like this.

529
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,940
Do you have a million?

530
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:01,942
i had never thought
about going into business before.

531
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,529
When you live in a suitcase,
you don't need a place ofyour own.

532
01:03:06,364 --> 01:03:08,365
But things had changed.

533
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:10,409
I had to start planning
for the future.

534
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,831
That night,
I had a nice chat with the manager.

535
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,376
He even offered a helping hand

536
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,588
should i ever open my own shop.

537
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,008
- Another beer?
- Sure, one more.

538
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,737
How much money do you have?

539
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,588
I stayed away from that bar
for some time,

540
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,800
partly because I didn't want
to hear song number 1 81 8.

541
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:12,096
But there are some things
you can't escape.

542
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:16,809
i've never returned
to that restaurant since that night.

543
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:53,930
Wishing you good fortune
and long life to reach the heavens

544
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:58,184
Wishing you a happy birthday

545
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,981
May this day bejoyous
foryou everyyear

546
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:07,484
Best wishes to you

547
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:49,109
How are you, my boy?

548
01:05:51,905 --> 01:05:54,365
Your dad's fine.
Don't worry about me.

549
01:05:58,536 --> 01:06:00,371
Soon it'll be your birthday.

550
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:03,916
I'm sorry i can't come home.

551
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:08,170
Is your mother feeling better?

552
01:06:09,923 --> 01:06:13,884
Is your sister behaving herself?

553
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,894
Sato-san is a real family man.

554
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,233
He was a film director
before he opened this place.

555
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:34,614
So he always communicates
with his family by making a videotape.

556
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,411
I'm sure his son must be very happy
to receive his videotapes.

557
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,416
Sometimes i want
to try the same thing.

558
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,918
But I don't know
who i'd send my tapes to.

559
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,631
i don't want to end up
sending them to myself.

560
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:10,107
You whom i hold in my heart

561
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:20,242
Why did you leave my side

562
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:26,790
Because ofyou

563
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:31,838
I'm sad all the time

564
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,551
I miss you with all my heart

565
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:46,186
My beloved

566
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:51,066
Come back to me

567
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:58,155
Hurry back to my side

568
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:01,826
Though i'm not like Sato-san,

569
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:05,038
I can feel the same happiness as his son
on receiving his father's tape.

570
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,386
Get out of here!

571
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,826
I've got nothing to say.
i want to go to sleep.

572
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,753
Are you crazy?

573
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,547
Get out of here!

574
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,935
Go away!

575
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:44,697
Later that night, I discovered Dad
secretly watching the tape.

576
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,492
He really enjoyed it.

577
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,787
I'm usually very bad at details,

578
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:55,667
but i remembervery well
that it was his 60th birthday.

579
01:10:56,835 --> 01:11:00,922
He kept laughing as he watched it.
Who knows what he found so funny.

580
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:03,257
But I know he was happy.

581
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,177
Stupid kid!

582
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:33,621
When you've worked
with someone for a long time,

583
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,874
he can have a certain effect on you.

584
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:40,085
I knew that fragrance very well.

585
01:11:40,878 --> 01:11:44,298
i just wasn't used
to smelling it on anotherwoman.

586
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,099
This suit fits me well.

587
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,643
But I think it's shrunk a little.

588
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,985
I never liked this fragrance
all that much.

589
01:12:06,195 --> 01:12:08,905
This afternoon
I smelled it on anotherwoman.

590
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,869
She wants to see you very much.

591
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,413
I set up a meeting foryou with her.

592
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,750
You're not gonna go, right?

593
01:12:23,212 --> 01:12:26,423
You should go.
That wayyou could clear things up.

594
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,930
Then again,
it's even better ifyou don't go.

595
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,688
I know you'll go.

596
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:43,940
You can have this back.

597
01:13:36,994 --> 01:13:39,079
I want...

598
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:41,748
a bag ofchips.

599
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,835
The yellow ones, not the red.

600
01:14:22,373 --> 01:14:25,585
They sat there together
for a long time that day.

601
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:28,045
I wonderwhat they said
to each other.

602
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,090
it rained the whole time.

603
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,717
i started to think,

604
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,720
"it's raining so hard.
How will i get home by myself?"

605
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:54,279
Just when i really needed a raincoat,

606
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,240
he returned to my side.

607
01:15:01,078 --> 01:15:03,121
It would be so great

608
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,666
if it could rain forever.

609
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:11,963
I'm not coming up.

610
01:15:16,677 --> 01:15:18,595
Then why'd you walk me home?

611
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,100
You should have let me
come back alone!

612
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,353
I was thinking ofcoming back
by myselfanyway.

613
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,648
Why did you do that?
Think it'd be easier on me this way?

614
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:30,733
You're crazy!

615
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,111
Fuck off!
I never want to see you again!

616
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,658
I thought we had agreed on this.

617
01:15:38,783 --> 01:15:41,536
Not me!
I never agreed to anything!

618
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:45,789
I asked you not to see her, but you did.
Now what do you want from me?

619
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:49,292
You think i'm a fool?

620
01:15:49,418 --> 01:15:51,461
Get lost!

621
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:55,758
Liar!

622
01:16:01,472 --> 01:16:02,430
Give me your arm.

623
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:09,980
Why'd you do that?

624
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,152
Can't I leave you a memento?

625
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:19,364
You might forget my face,
but not my bite.

626
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:27,163
But my face is easy to remember.
I have a mole.

627
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:32,503
Ifa woman with a mole on her face
comes up to you on the street,

628
01:16:35,047 --> 01:16:37,507
it could be me.

629
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:43,514
You won't remember me.

630
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:48,810
Yes, i will.

631
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,842
Do I remember her?

632
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:22,302
Actually, it's not that important.

633
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:23,846
For her,

634
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:26,848
i'm just a stopover
on thejourney of her life.

635
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,435
i hope she reaches
her destination soon

636
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,188
and finds a man who really loves her.

637
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:35,523
We all need a partner.

638
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:39,737
When will i find mine?

639
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,121
Are we still partners?

640
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,688
I didn't know
how to answer that question.

641
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:17,274
I had come to look at partners
from a new angle.

642
01:18:18,109 --> 01:18:20,944
As a business partner,
she was perfect.

643
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:25,032
But she wasn't the kind of partner
you could spend your life with.

644
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,244
I'd like to terminate
our business relationship.

645
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,802
Do me one last favor, will you?

646
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,814
I don't know why i agreed.

647
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,735
Maybe because
it was the last time.

648
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:27,094
I want to place
an advertisement for my friend.

649
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,349
On the front page.

650
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,518
The best thing about my profession

651
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,104
is there's no need
to make any decisions.

652
01:23:05,229 --> 01:23:07,230
Who's to die, when, where-

653
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,400
it's all been planned by others.

654
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,444
I'm a lazy person.

655
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,864
I like people to arrange things for me.

656
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,199
It's been a bit different lately.

657
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:20,911
I want to change this habit.

658
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,998
i don't know
if it's a good decision or not,

659
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:27,459
but at least it's mine.

660
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:20,720
Old people say taking someone's picture
shortens that person's life.

661
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:23,056
i'm not sure it's true.

662
01:24:24,516 --> 01:24:26,934
One evening, Dad wasn't feeling well.

663
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,146
I took him to the hospital.

664
01:24:30,856 --> 01:24:33,942
He passed away a while later.

665
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:41,075
All these years, i've always felt
like a little boy because of him.

666
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,788
He was someone i could always turn to,
someone to solve all my problems.

667
01:24:47,414 --> 01:24:50,751
Packing up his stuffthat evening,

668
01:24:51,168 --> 01:24:53,420
I felt like a grown-up
for the first time.

669
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,926
But i don't wanna be a grown-up.

670
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,596
I sure wish Dad
could always be with me!

671
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:22,199
When i left the hotel,
the videotape was all i took with me.

672
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,577
i watched it over and over
before i left.

673
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:14,560
Watching Dad cook in the kitchen,
i feel very happy.

674
01:27:15,979 --> 01:27:19,148
Though i know
I'll never taste his steaks again,

675
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,569
I'll never forget how they tasted.

676
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,454
You again?
i'll be damned!

677
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:34,497
Stop pulling my hair!
You promised!

678
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,251
You should know not to touch it.

679
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,503
I'd love to be your customer.

680
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,588
Did I ever say no?

681
01:27:42,047 --> 01:27:43,840
Did I?

682
01:27:44,007 --> 01:27:47,510
Look at me! How do I look?
Don't touch me!

683
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,262
My wife has gone to China.

684
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,807
I have some business to take care of.

685
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,686
Give me three hours.
I promise i'll be back on time.

686
01:27:55,811 --> 01:27:58,271
Three hours, okay?
Three hours.

687
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:01,817
Two hours?

688
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,695
It's a deal.
Two hours and I'll be back.

689
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,198
Come on, trust me.
We're old friends now, aren't we?

690
01:28:08,365 --> 01:28:11,702
It's a small world. We keep running
into each other. Two hours.

691
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,745
Trust me, please!

692
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:16,707
You have my word.
We're brothers, right?

693
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:22,170
You want it written in blood?

694
01:28:23,046 --> 01:28:24,630
You gotta be kidding!

695
01:28:25,716 --> 01:28:26,966
That's my bone!

696
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,094
Just one, okay?

697
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:33,056
ifyou cut them all off,
I won't be able to go out in public!

698
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,730
Could I have some change, please?

699
01:28:47,654 --> 01:28:48,572
Thanks.

700
01:28:53,243 --> 01:28:54,994
I'm downstairs already.

701
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:57,539
Hurry and come down.

702
01:28:57,789 --> 01:28:58,914
Bye-bye.

703
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:09,925
It must havejust been bad luck.

704
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:14,139
Soon after Dad died,
Sato-san returned toJapan.

705
01:29:15,557 --> 01:29:17,684
Since i didn't have much in savings,

706
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,770
I could only do what i'm best at:

707
01:29:19,895 --> 01:29:21,563
being my own boss.

708
01:29:22,105 --> 01:29:24,690
But i was very cautious this time.

709
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:27,485
I tried to pick the stronger shops.

710
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,364
Ones that wouldn't get hurt easily.

711
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:33,617
Like this one.
Its equipment was mostly steel.

712
01:29:33,784 --> 01:29:35,702
It saves a lot oftrouble.

713
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,704
At times i'd run into acquaintances.

714
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,625
Some hadn't changed much.

715
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:44,711
Others I hardly recognized.

716
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:48,255
I was always glad when i saw them,

717
01:29:48,507 --> 01:29:51,592
even though
they might not remember me.

718
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,721
Ofcourse, there were exceptions.

719
01:29:57,057 --> 01:29:59,393
On August 29, 1 995,

720
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:01,936
I ran into my first love again.

721
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,981
But she seemed to have forgotten me.

722
01:30:07,484 --> 01:30:09,860
I guess i'd gotten too handsome.

723
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:20,664
- How come you're so late?
- I was busy.

724
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:21,957
What's he doing?

725
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,834
Who knows?

726
01:30:41,351 --> 01:30:44,311
It was cold that evening.

727
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:48,567
I hadn't expected winter
to come so soon.

728
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:57,159
i'm less and less used
to this kind ofweather.

729
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:02,080
Winter seems so long this year.

730
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:05,625
Though I eat a lot every day,

731
01:31:07,377 --> 01:31:08,961
I still feel cold.

732
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:15,050
I've gotten used to life
without a partner.

733
01:31:16,845 --> 01:31:20,306
Though i work with others at times,

734
01:31:20,432 --> 01:31:23,059
I don't usually have fixed partners.

735
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,980
i've grown more cautious.

736
01:31:29,108 --> 01:31:32,068
I won't make their beds anymore,
for example.

737
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:35,237
I don't inspect their trash,

738
01:31:37,073 --> 01:31:39,241
'cause i believe
even more strongly now

739
01:31:39,368 --> 01:31:42,662
that the best partners
don't get emotionally involved.

740
01:32:41,721 --> 01:32:44,849
You rub elbows
with a lot of people every day.

741
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,979
Some strangers might become
your friends or even confidants.

742
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:52,649
So i never turn my back
on a chance to rub elbows.

743
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:55,735
Sometimes i rub till i bleed.

744
01:32:56,069 --> 01:32:58,654
No big deal,
as long as I'm happy.

745
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:07,122
That night,
I ran into that woman again.

746
01:33:07,789 --> 01:33:10,833
I knew very well we'd never be
friends or confidants.

747
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:14,170
We'd had too many chances
to rub elbows in the past.

748
01:33:14,671 --> 01:33:17,673
We had rubbed elbows
till our clothes tore, but still no sparks.

749
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:21,177
Maybe it was the weather,

750
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:24,931
but that evening i felt a spark.

751
01:34:01,217 --> 01:34:04,554
As i was leaving,
I asked if he'd give me a ride home.

752
01:34:07,057 --> 01:34:09,893
i hadn't ridden
on a motorcycle in a long time.

753
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:13,396
Actually, i hadn't been
that close to a man for a while.

754
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,650
The road wasn't that long,

755
01:34:17,984 --> 01:34:19,985
and i knew i'd be getting offsoon.

756
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:24,740
But at that moment
i felt such warmth.

757
01:36:02,672 --> 01:36:05,675
