574
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,510
to make it short it finally transpired

575
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:10,910
the what he wanted from me was bred for

576
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:12,539
his brass bread but I have no bread it

577
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:17,098

colors come back and his little<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheeks</font>

587
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:44,399
perhaps and then I lost patience use

00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,838
your head can't you use your head you're

589
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:53,759
on earth there's no cure for last it was

593
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,259
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the earth will awaken</font>

594
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,119
spring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rivers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and seas will run</font>

595
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:11,489
with fish again but there's money in

596
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:17,249
heaven still for him to seals like you

597
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:19,199
gradually I'd cool down sufficiently at

598
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:23,698
least to ask him how long he<font color="#CCCCCC"> had taken</font>

599
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:26,818
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way three whole days good and</font>

600
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:31,079
well conditionally left the child deep

601
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:34,139
in sleep but deep in what sleep deep in

602
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:37,140
what sleep already let's make its shores

603
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:40,528
I finally offered to take him into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

604
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:43,259
service he had touched a chord and then

605
00:50:40,528 --> 00:50:51,869
I imagined already that I wasn't much

606
00:50:43,259 --> 00:50:54,088
longer for this world well here if

607
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:56,699
you're careful you might die a nice

608
00:50:54,088 --> 00:51:01,798
natural death in peace and come from

609
00:50:56,699 --> 00:51:05,668
well in the end he asked me what i

610
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:09,418
consent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take in the child as well if</font>

611
00:51:05,668 --> 00:51:12,478
he was still alive it was the moment I

612
00:51:09,418 --> 00:51:16,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">was waiting for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him would i consent to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">take in the child I can see him still</font>

614
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:22,829
down on his knees his hands flat on the

615
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:29,820
ground glaring at me with his mad eyes

616
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:33,509
