deaf blind and mute from the age of two

00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:26,639
did he succeed with her he did it's

354
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:29,160
possible with patients I suppose

355
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,289
something they did not give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

356

certificate foreign proteins after this

357
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:37,590
morning's lesson the captain wants me to

for other people not really the only

365
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:06,000
hope is to teach them to do it for

366
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:11,849
themselves that's what I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

367
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,659
with Helen what you demand of her now is

368
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,659
all she'll ever be

369
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:42,778
step captain

370
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:27,679
and if what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

371
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:31,190
enough Helen can't stand to be near her

372
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:37,548
things have gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse and I want you</font>

373
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:41,420
to give her notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> no well if you won't</font>

374
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:47,659
almost what do you mean captain<font color="#E5E5E5"> mrs.</font>

375
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:52,278
Keller miss Albin I find that I am not

376
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:55,429
satisfied with this that is this

377
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:57,108
arrangement will you please take off

378
00:40:55,429 --> 00:41:05,358
your glasses I find it very difficult to

379
00:40:57,108 --> 00:41:08,538
speak to you with them on of course if

380
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,009
you must keep them on now miss Sullivan

381
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:11,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">please tell me captain is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

382
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">house in the grove of trees being used</font>

383
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:17,088
for anything the garden house this is

384
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:20,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">just what I am talking about miss</font>

385
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:23,509
Sullivan if you expect to stay on here

386
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,028
there must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a change in your manner</font>

387
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:27,739
and you must convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that there's a</font>

388
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:30,528
slightest hope of teaching a child who

389
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:32,298
flees from you like the plague you could

390
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:35,179
show some sympathy you're absolutely

391
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:37,130
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> captain there is not the slightest</font>

392
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:40,489
possibility of teaching a child who runs

393
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,410
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from me it is hopeless here and the</font>

394
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:44,088
sooner<font color="#CCCCCC"> we realize that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sooner we can</font>

395
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:48,649
get to a solution it is not hopeless

396
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:51,739
Helen could talk by the time she was 10

397
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:53,809
months old before this illness she was

398
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:57,949
such a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> child yes she was an</font>

399
00:41:53,809 --> 00:42:01,069
extraordinary job I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

400
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:02,659
she's not that child anymore I've seen

401
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:04,400
pets behave better than she does and

402
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:08,778
it's your petty that's the cause of it I

403
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,329
beg<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pardon I'm afraid your love for</font>

404
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:13,429
helen is greater handicap to her than

405
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:15,019
her blindness or her deafness and here

406
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:19,759
before you came we spoke of putting

407
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:22,578
Helen in an asylum please don't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

408
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:26,420
obviously miss Sullivan thinks it's

409
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:29,180
hopeless here it's hopeless here I'm

410
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:34,099
only just beginning

411
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:56,899
please let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you please follow me</font>

412
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe I can only make progress with</font>

413
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:02,450
Helen if I have complete charge of her

414
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:06,230
but you already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no I mean day</font>

415
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:09,259
and night she must depend on me for what

416
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:11,809
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything her food her clothes her</font>

417
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:14,990
playtime her sweets all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

418
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:17,030
are tools that I can use to reach her

419
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:19,368
and how do you propose to do that when

420
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:23,030
she runs away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if she can run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

421
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:26,960
you I have no hope which is why I must

422
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:28,400
live with her somewhere else you can

423
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,159
bring Helen here after a long carriage

424
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,769
ride she won't know where she is and you

425
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:37,068
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> still see her every day provided she</font>

426
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:41,088
does not know you're here how long would

427
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:45,259
you keep her as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as it takes I know</font>

428
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:46,909
this is the way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Captain I cannot be</font>

432
00:43:56,088 --> 00:44:01,608
your charge to an asylum an asylum is no

433
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,119
