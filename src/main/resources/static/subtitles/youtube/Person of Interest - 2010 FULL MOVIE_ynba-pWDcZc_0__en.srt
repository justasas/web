yeah

313
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,050
you come back to nothing

314
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:41,050
not to the loved ones who wrote you that
the job's not to the ideas you had to

315
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,920
begin with and 20 or 30 or 40

316
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,269
you come back to waiting and mostly you
wait for another war

317
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,048
you don't know that's what it's about it
first the silence in you

318
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:14,309
you think it's sadness but it's not and
then after a while you can feel it

319
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
it's crystal clear

320
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:23,429
every next conflict is right around the
corner

321
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,599

322
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:44,318
yeah

323
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:35,769
war is just a numbers game when you get
down to it

324
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,409
when we dropped the atom bomb on
Hiroshima 50,000 Japanese died instantly

325
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,120
a hundred thousand died from radiation
poisoning within the next few days

326
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,369
a hundred and fifty thousand Japanese
burned up in a flash

327
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:16,778
a few bricks here a few breaks there

328
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,838
one block at a time you carve out the
center to save the periphery

329
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,179
yeah

330
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:43,190
they would have you believe the only way
to stop a terrorist is to exercise the

331
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:49,519
rights afforded to us by roe v wade
aboard the greasy bastards

332
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:58,130

a terrorist is to keep your dick in your

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,740
pants in the first place

334
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:11,058

difference effort not out there is it

353
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,719
different here

354
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,579
can one person change the course of
events many

355
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,980
yeah

356
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,250

357
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,130
give me what you got I will take that
hit for somebody

358
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:54,650
there's a dream i have a long fields of
snow stretched out endless fields of

359
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,769
snow and mountains in the distance

360
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,440
maybe one person in the world you can
talk to and it's enough

361
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,730
one person would be enough

362
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:31,139
there's a dream I have

363
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,309
to live

364
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:42,309
like other people live

365
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:48,379
- joke

366
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,380
like other people joke

367
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,529
- sit

368
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,530
in your dreams for one moment

369
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,230
with someone you could touch

370
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:29,329
who could touch you back

371
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,300
there's a dream I have

372
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,260
I pledge allegiance

373
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,630
to the flag

374
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,630
the united states of america

375
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,250
and to the Republic for which it stands

376
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,190
One Nation

377
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:43,139
under God

378
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,110
indivisible

379
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:52,989
indivisible

380
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:17,170
think of it this way mr. Dyer we get rid
of one small building in the vast

381
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,170
landscape of them and we save the rest

382
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:33,699
guys like me are over there doing your
laundry Iraq some place wherever we see

383
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:35,739
what you don't

384
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:39,729
every coffins about the same fucking
size

385
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,860
well we could do what you too mr. Dyer
sell off the social security numbers of

386
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,420
our peers for profit that anyone with a
bag of rice into the country

387
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,420
I don't do it for the profit

388
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,360
other people every day who need our help
and we betray them

389
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:11,409
these people need passports to escape
the certain tyranny of their geography

390
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:15,579
that's not good for you

391
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,039
that doesn't fit with your particular
philosophy of the world

392
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:26,219
helping people out of the most dire of
circumstances you can imagine

393
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:32,460
not when those people are potential
terrorists no I don't sell information

394
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,460
of terrorists

395
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,789
yeah

396
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:14,010
yeah

397
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,440
I'm glad you came

398
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,010
I'm glad you got my note now

399
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:51,949
yeah

400
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,710
yeah

401
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:17,019
first noticed I was being watched
several months ago when you sleep you

402
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:20,019
feel something on your neck

403
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:26,410
that's what it's like it's like a bug

404
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:33,369
that's what it feels like being watched

405
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:41,469
and then finally when they contacted me
about the bombing wait what

406
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:44,469
bombing

407
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,940
the one that's going to happen

408
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,260
it was relief what was

409
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:12,478
contact - no I wasn't wrong

410
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:24,639
they have photographs of me they have
files

411
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,380
I didn't hurt some of the recordings
they made some of the wiretaps I mean

412
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:43,320
I want you to know something i do not go
around killing my own people

413
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:48,029
I go to the gym I eat my fucking food

414
00:52:55,068 --> 00:52:58,068
don't expect you to understand

415
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:05,298
I'm not mad at you

416
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:08,298
that's the thing with people like you

417
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:12,529
I'm not one of them improve it

418
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:16,369
how promise me salt

419
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:23,930
promise you what anything just make me a
promise and keep it

420
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,960
what's this

421
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:48,719
these are your discharge papers

422
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:01,618
you want to talk about it

423
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:18,060
but i can promise you Terrence is a
voice this is my voice

424
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:22,529
you went to them you told them what you
were going through

425
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,440
they wouldn't treat you you deserted to
find a hospital

426
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,840
once you've found one they called you
when arrested you and then you were

427
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,789
dishonorably discharged

428
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:39,029
you didn't leave the army

429
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:45,119
Terrence the army left you

430
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,400
they cut you off didn't they

431
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,880
yeah

432
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,880
yeah

433
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:20,829
yeah

434
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:34,278
a good war is won from the center it
carves you want to get inside

435
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:40,099
you got to get inside there's only so
much you can do on your own

436
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:10,079
yeah

437
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,620
no wars are won in a room

438
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:19,599
the one in the room behind the room

439
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,239
a few bricks here a few bricks there

440
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:35,989
one block at a time you carve out the
center to save the periphery

441
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:01,409
yeah

442
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:14,539
whole life I've been preparing for
something that never came

443
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,588
preparing

444
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:25,588
what for me

445
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:39,769
cleanliness I think

446
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:45,010
a lifetime of shit

447
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:53,829
just one clean moment

448
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:05,780

449
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,400
yeah

450
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:41,450
there's a reason it's always ex-military

451
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:45,919
this is what the military does best and
blow shit up

452
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:53,829
we need a person of interest

453
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:57,789

454
00:59:09,608 --> 00:59:16,538

that's good because you want to know why

473
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:39,960

proven because the feds have always

474
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,490
