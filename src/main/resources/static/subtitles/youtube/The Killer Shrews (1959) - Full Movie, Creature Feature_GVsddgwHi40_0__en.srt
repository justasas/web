00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,998
that gate

321
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:51,220

326
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,410

327
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,409
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are beginning to starve</font>

328
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,910

<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry I had to threaten you with a gun</font>

331
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,720
but I didn't know how else to stop you

332
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,720
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very effective but all you had to</font>

333
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,460
do was tell me about it well I hoped I

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,829
wouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but you changed</font>

335
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,850
everything when you started to lead and

336
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:37,379
I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop you some way you say</font>

337
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:40,909
there's two or three hundred out there

338
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,910
man

339
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,859
that's right captain<font color="#CCCCCC"> thorn and if you'd</font>

340
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,420
stuck with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your rowboat and played</font>

341
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,798
Captain instead of trying to play

342
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,330
detective you wouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font>

343
00:24:51,798 --> 00:25:01,579
about how many are out there would you

344
00:24:53,329 --> 00:25:04,879
that's enough Jerry<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's wrong in</font>

half of it

349
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:24,519
I guess you're a little jumpy captain

350
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:28,149
yeah I'm sorry six months ago be managed

351
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:30,579
to Ashley the factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> control insides to</font>

352
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,880
let us are born six individuals to get

353
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:37,210
the study they were about the size of

354
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:42,429
buckshot at birth but the rate of growth

355
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:47,410
was abnormal they continue to grow road

356
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:49,269
there were mutants<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they inherited</font>

357
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,910
all the negative characteristics<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

358
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:59,379
their breed somehow they managed to

359
00:25:51,910 --> 00:26:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">escape but a month later we saw one of</font>

360
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,620
the old speakers they will multiply we

361
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,860
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in the world to</font>

362
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:12,789
exterminate them but no apparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> luck</font>

363
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:14,740
then we haven't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> any since de la</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">vida blinds them in there they forage</font>

365
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,750
only at night or less starving

366
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:23,019
but the fact that two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them charged</font>

367
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:26,950
and and Jerry at the gate last evening

368
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:33,278
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're available food</font>

369
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:36,130
on the island is nearing depletion then

370
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:39,490
what dr. they will exterminate each

371
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:42,519
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> till take a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days what do we</font>

373
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:51,128
wait until it's over I guess some wires

been down on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transformer I'm sorry</font>

375

well Jerry I felt she was sincere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

385
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:40,609
made sense from her standpoint wanting

her<font color="#E5E5E5"> father to leave the island with her</font>

387

look with the livestock<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shoes got</font>

into the bomb

427
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:32,200
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said father there's a life stuck</font>

428
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:37,839
did Mario forget to borrow those doors

couldn't get through the wood doors that

431
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:45,399
dug through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dirt floor let me ask</font>

432
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,470
you something doctor how could you

433
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,750
expose all our lives yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> included</font>

434
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,039
with those things out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there all you had</font>

those things got loose any unusual

438
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:03,039
experiment can produce unusual results

439
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:08,320
that's why I chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> this island isolated</font>

440
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:12,069
miles of open water in any direction our

441
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,359
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> is practically financed it's not</font>

442
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or military</font>

443
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:22,869
and the world is no danger his species

444
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,470
does not swim and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the shoes</font>

445
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:31,719
are concerned this island is their world

446
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:33,819
very soon right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this island is</font>

447
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,910
going to be a miniature reproduction of

448

an overpopulated world and you'll see

449
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:41,470
the importance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're working to</font>

450
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,210
avoid I'm not concerned about all this

451
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,339
theory what I'm concerned about is our

452
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,840
lives there'll be ample time to panic

453
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they run out of food and go on a</font>

sathorn the autopsy has proved what we

574
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:24,400
suspected several weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I concocted</font>

575
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:27,639
the most virulent<font color="#E5E5E5"> poison I could with</font>

578
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:38,048
doctor I wonder if you thought the

579
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:41,079
system of the sorex enabled them to

580
00:44:38,048 --> 00:44:43,059
assimilate that poison it remained in

581
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:48,220
the salivary glands of their jaws isn't

582
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:50,619
that wonderful I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry of course I</font>

583
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,929

584
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:57,640
view well<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you have something to</font>

585
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:59,649
counteract that poison once Mary it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

586
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,940
bitten I'm afraid as nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

587
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:06,130
could have done this indicates that they

588
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,130
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to get even so much as a</font>

589
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:11,170
scratch from these animals down more

590
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:14,798
poisonous than snakes what do you think

591
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,809
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all affected best way to find</font>

592
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:19,329
out is let them all<font color="#E5E5E5"> bhaijan see which</font>

with this hall in this lab and cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

598
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:33,759
the chances of getting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> front of</font>

605
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:51,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">plasters off that Adobe's as soft as</font>
