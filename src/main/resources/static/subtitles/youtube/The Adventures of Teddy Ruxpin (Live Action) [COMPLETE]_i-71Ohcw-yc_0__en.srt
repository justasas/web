not sure I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never actually seen him</font>

106
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,849
there's long as he's shooting at my

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,589
house it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the safest place in</font>

108
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:57,830
the valley to be now why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we take a</font>

109
00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:00,439
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your treasure map this was with</font>

110
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:04,129
the map but no one has ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to</font>

111
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:07,610
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is well it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

112
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:11,269
part of a medallion it appears to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

113
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:14,270
made of very area gold and kind of

114
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:20,839
crystal yes and there's writing on it

115
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:24,829
spirit treasure ledge some spooky to me

116
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:28,279
and now let's see this is indeed an old

117
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:30,889
map it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that the treasure is in</font>

118
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,039
the ancient hard to find city which lies

119
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,080
high in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> treacherous mountains I've</font>

120
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,449
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are impossible to climb</font>

121
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,389
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings me to why you were</font>

122
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:46,070
fortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have met me come with me</font>

123
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:50,029
the fact is I'm something of an inventor

124
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:53,510
gentlemen this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my latest invention I</font>

125
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:57,529
call it an airship and I'm about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

126
00:08:53,509 --> 00:09:00,769
it out for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time you kind of</font>

127
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:02,990
looks like a boat well yeah yeah as a

128
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:06,949
matter of fact it did start out to be a

129
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:10,220
boat but then I realized I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

130
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,770
close to water you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

131
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,410
close to water yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be kind of</font>

132
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:19,069
good for a boat<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be close to water</font>

133
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:22,669
precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was my exact</font>

134
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:26,060
conclusion but then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea hit me in</font>

135
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:29,360
if a boat could float on water it could

136
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:33,319
also float on air if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> air is hot that</font>

137
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,320
is with this airship we can fly as high

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,210
and is free as a bird we can fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,990
over the treacherous mountains to the

140
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:43,519
hard defying city that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful you</font>

airship to move in any given direction

231
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:05,109
you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply a force in an opposite</font>

232
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,028
direction such as in this large manually

233

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about the effect of wind</font>

235
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:13,409
and various aspects of navigation it's

236
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,440
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simple</font>

263
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:14,220
determine which direction to head in uh

264
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:17,279
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find much wood</font>

that for a region is arid and

282
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:25,918
inhospitable as this desert to support

283
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,569
any form of life as we know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

284
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,570
virtually impossible

285
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:40,148
impossible

286
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:10,349
