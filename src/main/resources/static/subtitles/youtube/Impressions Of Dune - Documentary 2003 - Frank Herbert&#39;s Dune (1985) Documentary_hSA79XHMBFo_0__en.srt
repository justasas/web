1
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:28,679
a beginning is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> delicate time</font>

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:28,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">know then that it is the year 10,000 191</font>

3
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:49,570
something sleeps inside us and seldom

4
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,570
awakens

5
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:03,719
the sleeper must awaken my father had

6
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,478
acquired the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the book and the</font>

7
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,618
book was one of my favorite books of all

8
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:14,429
times I i had read at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

9
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:16,438
there were only three out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so I very</font>

10
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,868
much wanted to be involved I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it</font>

11
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,449
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but more important I</font>

12
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:25,200
thought David<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a good it was a good</font>

13
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,390
director and these two things said well

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,179
I love this something good was come or

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,390
when I read the book I didn't really see

16
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arthur we're going to make a movie out</font>

17
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:41,250
of it then I read the script and saw the

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,049
David done a pretty good job at sort of

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:48,090
narrowing it down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still keeping</font>

20
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it pretty complicated when David Lynch</font>

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,709
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> dune I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was generally</font>

22
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,599
perceived that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got it because he was</font>

23
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,509
he was coming off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> success of the</font>

24
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,700
Elephant Man which in turn was a was a

25
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,530
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise to to lynch fans because</font>

26
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,079
before that all he done was this very

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,318
strange cult underground movie

28
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">eraserhead so it was perceived as risky</font>

29
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,878
but exciting and people kind of their

30
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,400
hats were off to Dino De Laurentiis for

31
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,429
taking a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with this sort of</font>

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,379
almost avant-garde director but he had

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,590
proven himself as a commercial director

34
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:28,739
with the Elephant Man there was a lot of

35
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,628
excitement about this movie because well

36
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,390
for one thing from all the Frank Herbert

37
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:35,789
fans mean dune was a was an enormous

38
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,229
cult science fiction novel that people

39
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,179
have been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make into a movie</font>

40
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,969
for years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years and now</font>

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,000
they were finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it so the</font>

42
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:49,960
anticipation was very high I see the

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,280
truth of it could he be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one maybe</font>

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,409
it would he be ours to control there are

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,390
some books<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should never be made</font>

46
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,039
into movies Moby Dick is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its been</font>

47
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,139
made several<font color="#E5E5E5"> times now and it's never</font>

48
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,509
made well Moby Dick is one of those

49
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that is a book leave it as a book</font>

50
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we say in Yiddish wasn't gain let be</font>

51
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:12,039
don't mess with it there's some things

52
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,359
you just don't screw with well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

53
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,789
thought that about doing I thought dude

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,670
was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those books that read well</font>

55
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:22,959
and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater of your mind your</font>

56
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:26,019
imagination could make it far more<font color="#E5E5E5"> abune</font>

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,670
sexier more adventurous more dark and

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,800
many layered than you ever could in a

59
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,469
film you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I always felt that one of</font>

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems or one of the mistakes</font>

61
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe that we made was to try and be too</font>

62
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:41,169
faithful to the book you know it was

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,439
such an incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> undertaking to just</font>

64
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,509
try and be and tell that<font color="#CCCCCC"> story with all</font>

65
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,849
those characters all those planets all

66
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:55,139
those words in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worlds and you know</font>

67
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:55,139
but but we did it somehow

68
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,890
you have to go with Lynch's movies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

69
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest unconscious level they're really</font>

70
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:11,000
about imagery and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I remember the</font>

71
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,729
images of that movie twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> years later</font>

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,970
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more vividly than I remember say</font>

73
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:19,250
Superman which was a huge commercial hit

74
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,989
and was a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it doesn't</font>

75
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,910
stick with you the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the dune</font>

76
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,560
sticks with you and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

77
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,180
storytelling because the storytelling

78
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,500
isn't particularly great in the movie

79
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,459
and that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why it</font>

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,610
wasn't a commercial hit but but boy you

81
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,560
know as a visionary thing even for all

82
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,540
its flaws I think it's much more

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,579
interesting than<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the Hollywood</font>

84
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,200
science<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiction fair and one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

85
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:49,159
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things about it is how it</font>

86
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,800
the the iconography of it goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,680
past well it's actually wildly eclectic

88
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,240
because you've got some people dressed

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,579
as if they were in like a Shakespearean

90
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,980
play and you've got other people dressed

91
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:03,680
as sort of Nazi storm troopers and

92
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,169
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> Venetian architecture and</font>

93
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,470
you've got Victorian trappings you've

94
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:13,728
got 1930s telephones it's the most

95
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,660
eclectic from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> design point of view and</font>

96
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:18,050
that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that's</font>

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,340
fascinating about it is that it but

98
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,199
there's very little that's actually

99
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:23,029
futuristic about it and we generally

100
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">assume that science fiction is going to</font>

101
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:29,049
be futuristic and it is said in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

102
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">future but you wouldn't know it</font>

103
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:40,310
it was a difficult road to cast because

104
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:43,670
he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be young he had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be princely</font>

this is the Reverend Mother guys Helen

Kyle kind of you know worked after we

108

saw many many many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different people</font>

109
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:06,439
he he he he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> that charisma precise</font>

110
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,870
control june and i actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

111
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,569
history before the film<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was a big fan</font>

112
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,300
of the books by frank herbert when i was

113
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,579
i guess i discovered them around 15 when

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,810
i was 15 years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and took to them</font>

115
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,699
immediately i had never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

116
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,680
science-fiction fan really but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

117
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,629
something about it maybe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because</font>

118
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,259
the age of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the character in the book was</font>

119
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,709
similar to my age 15 or so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really</font>

120
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:34,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">really responded to it um I'll cut to</font>

121
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:35,899
about I guess eight years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later I was</font>

122
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,579
working in seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a plate just</font>

123
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:41,569
graduated<font color="#CCCCCC"> from school earlier that year</font>

00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">from my training and and i got a call i</font>

125
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:47,329
received a call on my message machine in

126
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,639
seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a casting agent who had</font>

127
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:53,449
come to Seattle and was looking for

128
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:56,509
unknown actors at that time to to

129
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,920
audition for the role of Paul and she

130
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,839
had called<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to various theaters</font>

131
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,470
and as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was performing there I was sort</font>

132
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,289
of known at that time in seattle<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be</font>

133
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,290
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very small capacity and so my name</font>

134
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:14,180
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as a potential you know audition</font>

135
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:15,890
eat and so there I was met with casting

136
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,600
Lady Elizabeth<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lustig is her name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

137
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">she recorded me and doing this very odd</font>

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,980
audition because of that to that point

139
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,269
I'd only been really stage trained and

140
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,150
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand this</font>

141
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:31,639
relationship to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera and but she</font>

142
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:33,919
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> encouraging and helpful and she</font>

143
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,719
took my tape down to David Lynch and

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,910
Rafaella De Laurentiis at universal

145
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,110

146

called and said we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen test</font>

147
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:46,139
you so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> found myself on a plane all</font>

expenses<font color="#CCCCCC"> paid it from Seattle to LA</font>

149

that's how it started<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop fear fear is</font>

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,249
a perfectly competent actor and in this

157
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:16,769
case he was young and I think a little

158
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:20,219
frightened and did a perfectly yeoman

159
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:23,098
job but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisca anise and Max von</font>

160
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:25,408
Sydow and and everybody else in the cast

161
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:30,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the characters are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so individual</font>

162
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:34,259
even sting sting really I will kill you

163
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:39,168
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them were just the most wonderful</font>

164
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,168
kind of repertory company

165
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,879
Frank Herbert was around a good deal I

166
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:52,289
remember and always just again boy you

167
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,480
know kind of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> adage of poison this</font>

168
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:56,579
great you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is so much</font>

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,730
fun to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a part of this and to see this</font>

170
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,528
happening and you know he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

171
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">with pronunciations you know from time</font>

172
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:09,750
to time and but he really as I recall

173
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,899
didn't impose or you know him cell phone

174
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,610
in any way he's like just very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font>

175
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,470
see his vision you don't come to life

176
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in whatever form I mean obviously</font>

177
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,080
this book had to be altered<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great deal</font>

178
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,839
and he just seemed to be quite fine with

179
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,020
you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> form it took he was</font>

180
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,600
always fascinated by the schedule well

181
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,490
you know I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> our scheduling with</font>

182
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,730
those little strips you know and he was

183
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,528
always he was fascinated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

184
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,930
that his book was turned into these

185
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:44,939
colorful strips Frank was a strange man

186
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:51,539
but he must have been he vote you didn't

187
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:54,420
he I said to him once or twice explain

188
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:57,059
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about her to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and he'd say</font>

189
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:00,539
oh look at the index you'll find it all

190
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:05,519
in there so I said no but tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what</font>

191
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:07,819
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

192
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,819
could

193
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:18,589
I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing 16 or 18 budgets for</font>

194
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:20,720
all over the world we were trying the

195
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,259
third that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we needed we're</font>

196
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,690
big stages because we had all these sets

197
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:30,769
that we needed to build and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

198
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,770
desert so I did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different we</font>

199
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:36,079
did it early in Morocco we did England

200
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:41,838
and I can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember how many</font>

201
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:44,750
versions of budgets we did and Mexico

202
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Churubusco had these huge stages often</font>

203
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:53,179
with dirt floors but you know big empty

204
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:55,909
rooms and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we went in and we</font>

205
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:57,799
just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets and every one of them I</font>

206
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:00,980
mean we just filled them completely once

207
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,809
and then basically knocked them all down

208
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,019
and filled them again we had so many

209
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:08,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">scents it had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything it really did</font>

210
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,389
have everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to make</font>

211
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:15,830
the film the fact that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> took so long</font>

212
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it was so complicated thee when you</font>

213
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,320
come to consider it the script was so

214
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:24,470
complicated you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing his uh he's a</font>

215
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,300
story that's created in someone's head

216
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,759
there's nothing real you know there's

217
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,719
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prop in the film that was a real</font>

218
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,600
thing you could buy in a store

219
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,570
everything had to be made so everything

220
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the smallest you know weapon to the</font>

221
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,500
you know the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> set had to be built</font>

222
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,500
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> scratch</font>

223
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:54,210
when we were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juarez in the desert in</font>

224
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:57,330
high summer and it was not so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

225
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:00,210
problem for us we we decided to work

226
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:03,900
very early in the morning from<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

227
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,970
five until<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hoppus one and that was what</font>

228
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,590
we called it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mainly</font>

229
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,360
because the actors were wearing rubber

230
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,620
suits and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> falling down like</font>

231
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,450
ninepins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the crowd and so it was</font>

232
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,370
were very unbearable for him for them

233
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,040
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that period of about two weeks in</font>

234
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,490
Juarez<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the high summer some images or</font>

soundstage churubusco<font color="#CCCCCC"> studios and he's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're all dressed in these rubber suits</font>

239
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:39,029
and which were very uncomfortable

240
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,920
designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Bob ringwood who is known</font>

241
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,589
for using a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> leather he did the</font>

242
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:48,509
Batman stuff and among many others but

this now got<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself a true</font>

261
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:18,399
is this what you seek<font color="#CCCCCC"> God the saw blade</font>

262
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:21,879
penetrates this year but look down we

263
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,649
have joined each other if then you can

264
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,649
see finally to get the moment

265
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:34,270
I worked for six months kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of parallel</font>

266
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,120
with the main unit but doing my own

267
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:39,519
thing sometimes you know very special

268
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,539
sometimes you know very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small</font>

269
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,279
occasionally very very big but a fair

270
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:49,329
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> special effects things that</font>

271
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,909
today would be done as a digital optical

272
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,460
we did them for real as mechanical

273
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:57,100
effects and took a little longer but but

274
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,200
you know we were pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at it one</font>

275
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,600
of the stages we turned into a desert

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,090
set but the sand was made with micro

277
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,190
balloons which is balloons made of glass

278
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,710
but there any microscopic to keep the

279
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:11,440
scale and then we had all these worms

280
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:15,220
that were model worms that you know and

281
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,620
we had to shoot very high speed you know

282
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,830
to make it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I me it was at the time</font>

283
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:25,539
groundbreaking I thought the worm was

284
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:28,090
horrible I did and we had all sorts of

285
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:31,659
sections of it of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course but they were</font>

286
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:36,060
also had the annoyed at it the full

287
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:39,449
thing I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hideous thing</font>

288
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:43,319
maybe it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> done as you know by Carlo</font>

289
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:47,910
Rambaldi who had done<font color="#CCCCCC"> et and that was a</font>

290
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:52,530
sweet little thing the little thing in

291
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:57,389
ET the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worm wasn't there was nothing</font>

292
00:15:52,529 --> 00:16:06,000
affectionate about it at all as far as I

293
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:08,129
could see nothing at all one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,700
was so hard was to make those eyes blue

295
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,710
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rotoscope each I of every of</font>

296
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,280
the friend today that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so simple</font>

297
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:19,920
I remember you're going to bar now

298
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:26,970
you'll remember mine I can kill with a

299
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:28,860
word we tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact lenses and they</font>

300
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,480
were horrible I mean it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard</font>

301
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,539
the actors because there was a complete

302
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">contact lens they look like one of those</font>

303
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:40,049
1940 pictures with the giant ants you

304
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,110
know it didn't look good the other

305
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:46,169
challenge that we had was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

306
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,409
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Frank Herbert says that</font>

307
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:53,009
Iraqis had no blue skies because there

308
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:54,899
was no water and that seems simple but

309
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:58,500
you know that meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even when we</font>

310
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,659
were outside we could never really shoot

311
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the sky we always had to</font>

312
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:06,089
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could take the sky out</font>

313
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:09,660
and change it I devised a thing called

314
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:11,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light flex which was a it's a very</font>

315
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,110
straight for peace is like a piece of

316
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,689
glass<font color="#CCCCCC"> in front of the camera which you</font>

317
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:18,299
illuminate you light up the glass so it

318
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:23,549
adds a spark of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

319
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:25,740
can control it and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> June I used in</font>

320
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:28,619
every movie but Bishop this was the

321
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,630
first picture I used it with and I think

322
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:33,599
it added a lot to the look of the proof

323
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,540
the picture my role<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really not so</font>

324
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the big shot with the real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

325
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:45,509
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the it was the the moments</font>

326
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,460
moments of a dream that were you know we

327
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:49,079
were interpreting differently and often

328
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,460
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very abstract the other thing</font>

329
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,829
that was that was really important in

330
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,350
the film was water I mean the images of

331
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:58,829
water were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important to Frank</font>

332
00:17:55,349 --> 00:18:03,149
Herbert and intense to David so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

333
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:05,819
try to find ways to capture water but in

334
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:09,180
a very abstract way so so all the the

335
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,919
water drops in the film you know the

336
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,470
rings of water and all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

337
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:22,860
images that we created it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our</font>

338
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:28,259
little little second unit I gotta say

339
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:30,899
David Lynch was was was brilliant he was

340
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,869
so composed during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the filming I mean I</font>

341
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,300
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've spoken since and I think at a</font>

342
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:40,889
certain point in time he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think he</font>

343
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:42,750
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt like um he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was you know there</font>

344
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,370
was the light that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> entered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tunnel</font>

345
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,630
and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was no light yet at</font>

346
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:47,159
the end that he could see so he was just

347
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a sort of a period of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

348
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">seemed to go on forever I mean you</font>

349
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember he was there are almost two</font>

350
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:55,559
years i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was there seven months</font>

351
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:57,329
but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of second</font>

352
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,769
unit and special effects shooting there

353
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:01,049
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so he was there for at least a</font>

354
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:02,910
year and a half perhaps longer we had

355
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,759
the advantage of having a lot of

356
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:09,180
pre-production time out there doing

357
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,970
tests and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see all the</font>

358
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,930
sets being built the development of each

359
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:19,170
set and stages of the movie so we were

360
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:21,090
we had a lot on board before we actually

361
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,029
started filming more so than any other

362
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:26,039
film normally we would get<font color="#CCCCCC"> Freddy would</font>

363
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:28,769
get four weeks preparation i would get

364
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,750
about a week testing so you're living

365
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the movie before you actually start and</font>

366
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,009
all the departments are coming together

367
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,990
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> building the sets and the</font>

368
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:42,240
special effects something like two years

369
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we started filming it was huge</font>

370
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:53,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">david is such an artist study where he</font>

371
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:55,649
lives in as little work that never

372
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:57,509
bothered him you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000</font>

373
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:01,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in the back he was worried about</font>

374
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">what was in front of his lens and then</font>

375
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,670
sometimes that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had problems</font>

376
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,730
with because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have two</font>

377
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:13,350
thousand extras instant suits in the

378
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:16,410
desert and he was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shoot the</font>

379
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:18,959
close-up of<font color="#CCCCCC"> kyle's I and I said David</font>

380
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,970
you can shoot that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you know in the</font>

381
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,190
studio anytime you want but we gotta

382
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,759
shoot that's what you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

383
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,160
we're here out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desert David never</font>

384
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,650
really worried himself about that David

385
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,450
had one of his black smoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the way</font>

386
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,190
to get the most the best look of this

387
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,170
smoke is to burn these tires which I

388
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,779
guess you can do in Mexico you can't do

389
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:42,120
in America but if you caught any of this

390
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:45,058
in your lungs as you were sort of round

391
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:47,339
you you it froze your vocal cords or

392
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:48,779
something or you couldn't your you

393
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,669
couldn't breathe I mean it wasn't the

394
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,970
strangest thing so I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

395
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:56,759
sequence with Patrick Stewart where you

396
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:00,210
know we come up and and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know give</font>

397
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,859
each other a big hug and on on one take

398
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remembered some of this the wind</font>

399
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,159
shifted in some of this black smoke came

400
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,849
right past us I remember i'm going to

401
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,220
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like nothing was</font>

402
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:15,449
coming I could not get it to work I said

403
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:19,679
oh she's Scott what am I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> done we</font>

404
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:23,370
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own ways of working and we</font>

405
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:27,750
continued to work the English Way<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

406
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:30,689
british way we wouldn't let we wouldn't

407
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:35,009
let the Americans take over I have a

408
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:40,920
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach where I stay very close</font>

409
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:43,470
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the director and expect my operator</font>

410
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,830
to be at my side and in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

411
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:49,679
time and this was the way I was I always

412
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:53,009
operated and it's the way Gordon goes

413
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,140
the better so we operate exactly the

414
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:55,750
same way I don't say put the camera here

415
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,150
Gordon

416
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,680
the camera there Gordon as a result of

417
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gordon listening to the director of</font>

418
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,810
myself he knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do so</font>

419
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,350
the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we finished discussing this</font>

420
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:11,169
shot with the director he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a</font>

421
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:14,379
camera mind up and everything connected

422
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,480
with that while I am getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

423
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,180
lighting sorted out pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francis the</font>

424
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,789
DP was a real character he was helpful

425
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,460
but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't really sort of the warm</font>

426
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:28,299
cuddly friendly type you know his first

427
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,470
was Roy Roy learner i think freddie took

428
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,839
perverse pleasure in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

429
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,339
shouting<font color="#CCCCCC"> out across the set to roid it</font>

00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,459
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix something you know and</font>

00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:38,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Roy was you know pipe up you know right</font>

432
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,590
away you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's like done you know</font>

433
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of like I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

434
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:45,579
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would imagine you know turn of</font>

435
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,769
the century or before you know they're

436
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:49,569
on a ship he's a captain his first mate

437
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,430
could be that scenario they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

438
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,809
been somewhere in India you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

439
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,539
relationship because it certainly was it

440
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:58,889
felt to me military in the best way in

441
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,889
that great English tradition

442
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:12,429
I went on from March through til

443
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:19,150
November of 84 so that seven or eight

444
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">months David wanted a three hour movie</font>

445
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:25,150
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dino wanted a two hour movie and</font>

446
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,880
indeed 01 it was fight to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

447
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,620
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and David was very reluctant to</font>

448
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,800
give stuff up and I could understand why

449
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:37,029
but I think we found a good way out of

450
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,129
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture stands up in</font>

451
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,680
the way it was finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked out but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

452
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:50,230
know it was a heartbreaking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> david</font>

453
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:52,450
for it to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name the</font>

454
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">failure is probably one of the very best</font>

455
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,059
two juicers I've ever known oh she was

456
00:23:55,299 --> 00:24:04,089
very she was a very knowledgeable and

457
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:06,909
very efficient you know she'd been

458
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:10,869
keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> build ball in a film studio</font>

459
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:13,210
almost and you know she just went along

460
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:18,819
with the run of things that she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

461
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:21,940
efficient and a great friend at her of

462
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:24,700
all the unit that was the thing about

463
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,549
any film on which you work that has

464
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,160
rafaela with you there was the greatest

465
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:36,460
camaraderie in the world they're really

466
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:40,240
and truly was she is an astonishing

467
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:43,329
person she really is and people will

468
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,329
work their guts off because she's doing

469
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:49,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same thing she never expects anyone</font>

470
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:54,399
to do anything that she won't do herself

471
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:58,059
I think when you're young ignorance of

472
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,300
sometimes make you achieve greatness

473
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:04,000
because you just don't know any better

474
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:06,940
and so you say okay well so sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

475
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,650
produce do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to produce dude then</font>

476
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,470
you know it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

477
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:15,550
I found out that no woman had ever had

478
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:17,710
ever produced before<font color="#E5E5E5"> dune I'm anything</font>

479
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:21,158
moving hood that the budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

480
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,110
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 million dollars i had no idea the</font>

481
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,929
first time I met Dino was at the Beverly

482
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:29,769
Hills Hotel and I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bungalow</font>

483
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:31,120
and Dino came to the door and he was

484
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,158
eating pasta or something was having a

485
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,639
late meal or an early dinner perhaps and

486
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,130
he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> low</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pasta there's an a stuck</font>

487
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,200
around I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad for disturbing him but</font>

488
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,870
and I could tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person I was with</font>

489
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,538
was a little nervous but he was very

490
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:48,729
generous I yeah he's a gummy gummy you

491
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:50,679
know in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great voice he's got d down</font>

492
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,390
you know so he I sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the couch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

493
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,919
he asked me like three questions you

494
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,520
know two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which i can remember which</font>

495
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:01,210
were how old you are I selves you know

496
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:04,119
at that time I was 22 he's a UH and he

497
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,038
said something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cut your hair</font>

498
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,329
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that I should put you</font>

499
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,460
know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whatever you need</font>

500
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:10,898
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and he sort of stared at me for</font>

501
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,100
a while it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was another question I can't</font>

502
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:14,678
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember because it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just real</font>

503
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:18,028
sore really very surreal and he's okay

504
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,028
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he got up and that was it</font>

505
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:27,239
I ended up hanging out<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much we</font>

506
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:31,200
were a little Musketeers<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Patrick</font>

507
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:32,608
Stewart myself and Everett McGill sort

508
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,350
of be you know we sort of hung out went

509
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:35,548
to dinners together and things I mean

510
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:36,839
David would join us<font color="#E5E5E5"> from time to time</font>

511
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:39,118
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would hang</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out with David a bit</font>

512
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,788
but he his obligations you know were

513
00:26:39,118 --> 00:26:44,548
quite varied there was always something

514
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:48,329
going on somewhere normally in the

515
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:52,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">fellows flat I must say in fact Richie</font>

516
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:55,138
Fleischer was doing Conan on the next

517
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,690
stage we were sort of back to back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

518
00:26:55,138 --> 00:27:02,098
he came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their parties of course and</font>

519
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:05,609
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the boys took some stills and</font>

520
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:08,848
Richard looked at the developed stills

521
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:11,519
god I didn't know I was such a porky I

522
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:12,960
bet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that the people who went to</font>

523
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,679
these parties had nothing to do with

524
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
shooting the film

525
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:27,558
I met David Lynch at at the American

526
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,079
Film Institute and we worked on a film

527
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:34,129
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eraserhead for many years so I</font>

528
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:37,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">had built this relationship with him you</font>

529
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">know he went on to do some more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work but</font>

530
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,829
then when it came to dune you know we

531
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,260
hired freddie francis it was a wonderful

532
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,028
wonderful cinematographer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> film</font>

533
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:50,329
but thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he could bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me on</font>

534
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:53,960
doing a second unit doing some extra

535
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:55,609
footage some special things that David

536
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,590
always had in mind for the movie I

537
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:59,359
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was mad and I still think</font>

538
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:03,349
he's mad but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's a wonderful guy to</font>

539
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:06,439
work with and makes up his mind what he

540
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:09,619
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought he was he was terrific I</font>

541
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:13,100
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this bizarre outlook on life</font>

542
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:16,908
and he was he's such an ordinary chap

543
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:19,129
yet he's got all these weird and

544
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:22,789
wonderful ideas I think perhaps there

545
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,470
was a sense that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were sort of joined</font>

546
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:28,638
at the hip kind of her tied together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

547
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:32,750
some way during this process you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

548
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:34,369
you know I guess I was you know the hero

549
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,759
of the film obviously and also sort of

550
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:40,939
the focus but I think I think there were

551
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:45,589
a number of the were there were a number

552
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,850
of battlefields I guess or not

553
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:49,099
battlefields let's call him and there

554
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:51,019
were a number of creative arenas there

555
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:53,209
were the Atreides the family<font color="#CCCCCC"> urug and</font>

556
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:56,089
myself Francesca Patrick all that you

557
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,429
know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the good to good warriors</font>

558
00:28:56,089 --> 00:29:01,099
and then there were the bad guys the

559
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">heart Conan's right and that was a world</font>

560
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:07,359
that David I think secretly really

561
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,359
preferred

562
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:46,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">david is absolutely brilliant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he really</font>

563
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">as he is a genius he's a crackpot petit</font>

564
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:55,049
jean a genius if the producer says no

565
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,940
that's not possible you'll find somehow

566
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:59,339
three days they each other not only is

567
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,309
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible it's already been done I'm</font>

568
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:13,259
terribly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fond of him I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am I love</font>

569
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:15,720
him dearly however the Duke will die

570
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:19,049
before these eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he'll know hello</font>

571
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:24,870
that is I then Vladimir Harkonnen

572
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:29,190
encompasses is doomed I think June was a

573
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:33,089
victim of the expectations people really

574
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:38,340
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I commercially they</font>

575
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:40,919
expected a big blockbuster it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

576
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,859
just too strange I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was too</font>

577
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,080
unconventional I mean there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

578
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:49,979
kinky stuff in it the great thing

579
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:54,059
against june was that there was no humor

580
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:57,990
in it I can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> even smiling once</font>

581
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:00,480
and it need it needed humor and there

582
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,250
wasn't Eddie at all there was a big

583
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,200
backlash against it you know there was a

584
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,089
lot of it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot of publicity</font>

585
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,769
about the movie before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> open how was</font>

586
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:10,379
going over budget have<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're having</font>

587
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:12,900
all sorts of problems in Mexico while

588
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,820
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> making as potential clashes</font>

589
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,130
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lynch and Dino De Laurentiis and</font>

590
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,720
the media kind of fed off that so I

591
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there was a certain amount of you</font>

592
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">know people smelled blood you know in</font>

593
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the air and there was a certain ganging</font>

594
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,329
up on the movie and went it open none of

595
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:30,089
the critics for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exception of David</font>

596
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:32,730
Ansen and myself of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course I was not a</font>

597
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:35,009
major critic but my stuff got around I

598
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,289
gave it a good review it was almost

599
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:40,440
universally panned I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the</font>

600
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:42,329
reviews of the movies because even the

601
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:47,039
good one makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you crazy you know it's</font>

602
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:47,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like you spent so much time on a</font>

603
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,829
movie and you're in

604
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,399
tensions are such that you know it's so

605
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:55,378
easy to sit down and tear at four years

606
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:57,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your life so I just don't read them</font>

607
00:31:55,378 --> 00:32:00,329
anymore critics think nothing will ever

608
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:05,548
make good film except a good film and

609
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:09,329
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terrible thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

610
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:11,519
but I ignore Christians completely my

611
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:14,878
review was one of the only positive

612
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:18,359
reviews that came out which I do not

613
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:21,028
apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I would write the same</font>

614
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,979
review today I think but I do feel that

615
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:27,929
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my colleagues kind of jumped on</font>

616
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bandwagon with undue viciousness you</font>

617
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:34,710
know i love the film I'm surprised

618
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,899
people didn't enjoy it more<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really was</font>

619
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,329
i I thought it would it would find a

620
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:42,329
bigger audience than it did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm afraid</font>

621
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:44,220
it wasn't perhaps promoted as well as it

622
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:48,869
could have been I don't know that the

623
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,429
studio really supported it it's that's

624
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:53,069
an unfortunate things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a</font>

625
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">very it's a very beautiful movie I'll</font>

626
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,939
miss the sea

627
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:04,538
but a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs new experiences they</font>

628
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:07,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">John something deep inside allowing him</font>

629
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:11,679
to grow most of what Universal did in my

630
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:14,048
view in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> view is indefensible they had</font>

631
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,048
<font color="#CCCCCC">no faith in the film they had no hutzpah</font>

632
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:20,379
they had no balls they had no no courage

633
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:22,599
you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people blame</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Universal</font>

634
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,278
the way they released it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the movie</font>

635
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,500
not being as successful as it should

636
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:30,069
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the movie was</font>

637
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:35,589
challenging you know it was maybe too

638
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:38,048
intellectual and too difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> it men</font>

639
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ESP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not your obvious popcorn movie</font>

640
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,609
but I think the book was that way and I

641
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,470
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know being faithful to</font>

642
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:48,219
the book which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we tried to do</font>

643
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:51,159
turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a movie that was difficult</font>

644
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,019
but the people that love it love it the

645
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:58,840
choice of director for a film is always

646
00:33:53,019 --> 00:34:03,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">a it's an unusual process I don't know</font>

647
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's any any Best Director for a</font>

648
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:07,389
film I mean I think David was a

649
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:10,628
wonderful choice for this one I think

650
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the studio is looking for</font>

651
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:14,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">the broadest possible audience they</font>

652
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:17,710
choose the safest possible director and

653
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:20,049
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their credit they supported David in</font>

654
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:23,199
going out on a limb and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and choosing</font>

655
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:26,619
someone who may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been the first</font>

656
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,969
choice for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of film but but the</font>

657
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:30,309
vision he brought to it is so

658
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:31,779
spectacular you think that the Lynch

659
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,759
would have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least gotten the benefit</font>

660
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doubt for trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something a</font>

661
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,060
little bit different and more original

662
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:44,859
and very personal not a total success

663
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:46,029
obviously but you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

664
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:48,190
same critics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're always complaining</font>

665
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,810
about how formulaic Hollywood movies are

666
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,349
and then when something not formulate

667
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:55,108
comes along they jump on the bandwagon

668
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:58,739
sort of kick it was down I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> dune</font>

669
00:34:55,108 --> 00:35:01,440
turned him off<font color="#E5E5E5"> making big budget movies</font>

670
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:05,369
because in a way you give up your

671
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,509
freedom you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for creative freedom</font>

672
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:12,539
when there's so much pressure on you

673
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:14,248
because of the budget the time and he

674
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:15,869
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hayden he said to me when he</font>

675
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:17,939
finished that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he never wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

676
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">another big movie again and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never has</font>

677
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,579
he's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> done smaller movie that he</font>

678
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:27,390
can control and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's been really</font>

679
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy doing that he's found you know his</font>

680
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:37,828
niche to think he loves<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this I</font>

681
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:42,028
think is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the is one of the</font>

00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:44,789
linchpins of dunes importance that it

683
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:46,768
ever actually got made it was a book

684
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:48,059
that shouldn't have been shot it was a

685
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:51,268
script that<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't have been written</font>

686
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:54,150
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a directorial job that was beyond</font>

687
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:56,219
anyone's doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a production that</font>

688
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">would beggar the imagination and</font>

689
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:00,868
bankrupt three studios it was a

690
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:03,179
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could not possibly be</font>

691
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,548
marketed in any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anyone could</font>

692
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,710
understand or that they would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

693
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:09,869
didn't hit its audience it looked like

694
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:12,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">it insulted its audience it looked like</font>

695
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:16,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">it defamed its its its originator and</font>

696
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:16,608
yet the film was made

697
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:29,050
and yet the film<font color="#CCCCCC"> remains after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

698
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,650
you know we're talking decades here this

699
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:34,990
film still holds up and when you go back

700
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,000
and you look at it you are drawn into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

701
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:40,179
as far as I'm aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> dune has never</font>

702
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">really come in for a major reassessment</font>

703
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:45,519
it always had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fans strong</font>

704
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:46,840
fans along the way and Harlan Ellison

705
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,679
and the science<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiction world I know</font>

706
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,320
defended it at the time but it's kind of

707
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:57,789
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think overdue for for a rediscovery</font>

708
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:00,070
and maybe maybe some years down on the

709
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:02,349
way they'll realize that it's a much

710
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,010
stranger and more interesting movie than

711
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,009
I thought at the time

712
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:15,798
follow the sleeper has awakened
