1
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,659
Separate the officers for interrogation.

2
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,701
l'll be damned.

3
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,221
General Spaatz, we meet at last.

4
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:54,222
Reichsmarschall Goring.

5
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,262
My wife. My daughter.

6
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:00,942
Your Eighth Air Force has destroyed
my beautiful Luftwaffe and...

7
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,861
...leveled our beautiful cities.

8
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,782
Even so, l prefer to surrender
to a fellow airman.

9
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,502
Gentlemen.

10
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:15,861
May l?

11
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,661
''The stars at night are big and bright

12
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:29,222
''Deep in the heart of Texas

13
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:33,622
''The prairie sky is wide and high

14
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:37,103
''Deep in the heart of Texas

15
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,463
''The sage in bloom is like perfume

16
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,822
''Deep in the heart of Texas''

17
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:57,822
Unbelievable.

18
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:00,942
Unbelievable.

19
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:04,462
Those pictures were on every wire service.

20
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:08,542
American officers throwing a party
for Hitler's Number Two man.

21
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,703
What was the commander thinking?

22
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,423
l'm told that it's a code of honor
among airmen that transcends politics.

23
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:18,182
- And brains, apparently.
- The commander was reprimanded.

24
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:22,263
lke has ordered that Goring be treated
no differently than any other prisoner.

25
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:24,304
Excuse me.

26
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:28,704
l finagled some real coffee
from the Chief Justice's office.

27
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:34,703
Elsie's the best scavenger
in the entire building.

28
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,983
You shouldn't have gone to such trouble.

29
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:41,504
Coffee's no trouble.
Now a set of tires, that's another story.

30
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,584
l still can't believe he's gone.

31
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,743
For me, it was like losing a father. Truly.

32
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:56,623
Whatever l have, whatever l am...

33
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,704
...it's because of Roosevelt.

34
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:02,824
l was in London, seeing Churchill,
when the news came.

35
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,784
With the end of the war in sight,
the President sent me as his confidant...

36
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:10,545
...to discuss a rather tricky subject.

37
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:14,145
What to do with captured Nazi leaders?

38
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,625
What was Churchill's opinion?

39
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,704
He said:

40
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:22,424
''They should be summarily shot
for crimes against humanity.''

41
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,305
What's your opinion?

42
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:30,145
lf it's a crime for the Nazis
to shoot people without a trial...

43
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,025
...how could it be less so for us
to do the same thing?

44
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:35,025
That's Truman's feeling, exactly.

45
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,465
And Churchill now shares that view.

46
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,704
Surprisingly enough, so does Stalin.

47
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,985
You're talking about a war crimes trial...

48
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:45,504
...which they attempted after the last war,
and it completely unraveled.

49
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,264
Because it had no weight.

50
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:51,105
This will be an international tribunal,
comprised of the four powers:

51
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:53,504
America, England, France and Russia.

52
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:57,425
President Truman wants
the best prosecutor in the country.

53
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,505
One with a reputation for being tough,
but impartial.

54
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,826
He wants you, Bob.

55
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:10,345
l haven't prosecuted a case in years.

56
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:15,466
Roosevelt chose you for the Supreme Court
because of your integrity as a prosecutor.

57
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:19,786
That's why Truman picked you for this.
Because he wants a fair trial.

58
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,425
Not a legal lynching.

59
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:23,425
l like it right here, Sam.

60
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,625
This would mean
l would have to step down.

61
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,986
A temporary leave of absence.
You'd be back in six months, maybe seven.

62
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,825
ls the President aware of the fact that
l'm opposed to the death penalty?

63
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:38,826
Yes. But he's not concerned, because
he knows you'll do whatever is right.

64
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,185
As you know,
a fair trial means an uncertain outcome.

65
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,467
lf we don't prove the defendants' guilt...

66
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,667
...they'd walk, even if we could smell
the blood on their hands.

67
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:50,706
- Do the Allied powers understand that?
- Truman does.

68
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,706
You'll have a chance
to make it clear to them.

69
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,306
The trial is yours to create, Bob.

70
00:07:57,387 --> 00:08:01,346
You get to set the rules,
hire the staff, find the setting.

71
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:04,226
You even get to pick the defendants.

72
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:10,266
This trial could unravel, too...

73
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:14,586
...like the last attempt,
if it is poorly planned...

74
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:18,067
...if it is unsound, legally or morally.

75
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:25,226
Or it could establish a basis for conduct
among nations...

76
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:29,226
...that would alter history
for generations to come.

77
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:38,868
The trial will be held in Germany.

78
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:42,708
That's where the defendants are,
the evidence, witnesses.

79
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,387
Are there any decent hotels still standing?

80
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:49,187
l don't relish the idea of spending months
in some dreary army base.

81
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,788
You won't have to worry about that.

82
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,307
No wives allowed at Army's request.
Bad for morale.

83
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,868
All those men over there
for years without their--

84
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,707
You don't want me there, fine.

85
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,228
l'll be downstairs, whenever you're ready.

86
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:13,548
Eighteen minus three.

87
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,107
Fifteen.

88
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:21,269
Fifteen plus seven.

89
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:23,948
Twenty-two.

90
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,068
Nine minus nine...

91
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:37,068
Good morning, General Spaatz.

92
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,948
l'm afraid l have to ask you
to get dressed and pack for travel.

93
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,709
Where are you moving us?

94
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,188
Only the Reichsmarschall.

95
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,269
You're being transferred to Bad Mondorf.

96
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:54,108
Well, you know, it's a very pleasant spa,
but why must l go alone?

97
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,828
Because that's where they're rounding up
German war criminals.

98
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:01,869
No!

99
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,389
No.

100
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,629
l'm sorry about that.

101
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,430
Get dressed, please.

102
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,389
You must be brave.

103
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,149
Very, very brave.

104
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,269
Edda, you will?

105
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,870
We know who you are,
Mr. ''Jew Butcher of Krakow.''

106
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,950
And we've seen the camps, too!
Nazi bastard!

107
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,549
l must say that l was lucky
when the Arms Ministry...

108
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,789
...was destroyed in an air raid in 1943.

109
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,350
lt rid me of useless paperwork
and pencil pushers.

110
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,029
Sir!

111
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,191
What do you think was the single most
effective thing you did during the war?

112
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,031
When Hitler appointed me
his Minister of Armaments...

113
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,471
...l threw out the military chiefs
and turned to the professionals.

114
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:06,391
lndustrialists and engineers.

115
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,390
Then l borrowed the ideas
of Walter Rathenau...

116
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,791
...the great Jewish chief of
the German economy during the last war.

117
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,670
Standardization of parts...

118
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,390
...the division of labor,
and the maximum use of the assembly line.

119
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,551
Thank you, Dr. Speer.

120
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,550
Gentlemen, we'll now break for lunch.

121
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:28,911
Dr. Albert Speer.

122
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,191
Obviously.

123
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:34,191
You're under arrest for major war crimes.

124
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,670
Move aside. Pay attention.
The orders are in.

125
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,432
Listen up! You'll all be taken
to different places of detention.

126
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,911
The following prisoners will go
to Bad Mondorf...

127
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:54,831
...as defendants in future war crimes trials.
Step forward.

128
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:57,272
Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel.

129
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:59,471
Grand Admiral Karl Donitz.

130
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,591
Colonel General Alfred Jodl.

131
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,192
Follow me.

132
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:11,072
l haven't left Washington since the war.
l couldn't even remember how to pack.

133
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:14,151
l was so worried about bringing
the things for the office.

134
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,231
l forgot half the things that l need.

135
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:20,152
l've one set of nylons for the entire time
and they already have a run.

136
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,631
l even traded ration coupons
with my friend so l could buy nylons.

137
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,951
You are as jittery as a hen.
What is the matter with you?

138
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,511
l've never been up in an airplane before.

139
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,753
- Good morning, Robert.
- John.

140
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:45,913
- Bob.
- Tom.

141
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,273
Robert, good morning.

142
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,632
This is my chief secretary, Elsie Douglas.

143
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:53,592
Elsie, this is Tom Dodd,
who'll be Deputy Prosecutor.

144
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,952
- lt's nice to finally meet you, Miss Douglas.
- Pleasure.

145
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,473
Colonel John Harlan Amen,
Head of lnterrogations.

146
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:00,513
Miss Douglas.

147
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:04,033
Colonel Telford Taylor, our liaison
with the other prosecuting teams.

148
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,593
- Pleasure.
- All mine.

149
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:08,832
And Colonel Robert Storey,
Head of Documents Division.

150
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,393
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

151
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:12,273
Now that we're all here, let's go.

152
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,553
So who are we really after?
Military leaders?

153
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:45,754
Political leaders?

154
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,873
What about the bankers and industrialists
who funded the Nazis?

155
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,274
What about the soldiers and civilians
who carried out the atrocities?

156
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:54,314
We can't put the whole country on trial.

157
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:56,554
We need to suggest
the scope of the crimes.

158
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,793
l want this trial to be the first of many.

159
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,754
How about choosing a symbolic figurehead
from each category?

160
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,513
We cover the whole spectrum.

161
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:06,394
- That way no one group gets off scot-free.
- Makes sense.

162
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:10,833
lf we win, we can keep prosecuting Nazis
till the cows come home.

163
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:13,315
Remember, we may also fail
to win convictions...

164
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,715
...in which case, some or all
of the defendants could go free.

165
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:19,714
l'm still wrestling
with the validity of this trial.

166
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,634
Crimes committed during war
have never been called crimes.

167
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:27,635
Let's focus on existing law.
What existing laws did the Nazis break?

168
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:32,595
Well, they broke peace and border treaties,
certainly Geneva and Hague Convention.

169
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:33,434
Right.

170
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:36,074
Every time they invaded a country,
they broke a law.

171
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:39,595
My fear is that at the end of the day,
when all is said and done...

172
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:44,435
...this trial will be perceived as nothing
more than triumph of superior might.

173
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:47,394
The winners exacting punishment
on the losers.

174
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:52,274
Our task is to make sure that
this is not the triumph of superior might...

175
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:56,755
...but the triumph of superior morality.
We're in a very interesting position here.

176
00:14:57,075 --> 00:15:00,275
We are in a position to fashion a future
in which aggressive war...

177
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,716
...will be dealt with as a crime.

178
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:04,836
Here, here.

179
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:35,675
Move it! Let's go!

180
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:38,675
Over there! Line them over there!
Come on, let's go!

181
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,916
Corporal.

182
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,157
New arrivals, identify yourselves.

183
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:56,036
- Fritz Sauckel, sir.
- Head of Labor Conscription.

184
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:57,317
Former head.

185
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,117
- Julius Streicher.
- Publisher of...

186
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:02,237
- l can't pronounce it.
- Der Strumer.

187
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:03,276
lt's filth.

188
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:06,317
You bankers are all Jews,
you think l don't know that?

189
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,996
- Shut up.
- Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht...

190
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:12,397
...formerly President of the Reichsbank
and Minister of the Economy.

191
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,076
l do not understand
why l have been accused here.

192
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:18,197
l'm your jailer, not your lawyer.
You'll get your day in court.

193
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,437
Hans Fritzsche.

194
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:22,797
Chief of Radio Operations
in the Nazi Propaganda Ministry.

195
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,156
Rudolf Hess, former Deputy Fuhrer.

196
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,317
Hess.

197
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:31,196
- You.
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.

198
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,677
Nazi Foreign Minister.

199
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:36,636
You.

200
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:39,837
Colonel, this is Dr. Robert Ley,
head of the German Labor Front.

201
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:41,677
- You're Albert Speer.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:44,597
- What's wrong with him?
- His mind's not what it used to be.

203
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:48,398
- He's a drunk, it finally caught up with him.
- l said, ''Shut up! ''

204
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,077
Colonel.

205
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:55,237
This man, Streicher, is a disgusting person.
A pornographer and a Jew-baiter.

206
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:58,717
- l do not wish to be housed with him.
- We make no distinctions.

207
00:16:58,798 --> 00:16:59,798
Colonel.

208
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,918
We respectfully protest our arrest.

209
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:05,597
We were only following orders,
nothing more.

210
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:08,798
As a fellow soldier,
surely you must understand.

211
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,718
Now you're no longer a soldier.

212
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,158
You are all war criminals.

213
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:27,398
All of you! Lock them up.

214
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:30,598
Nazi bastards!

215
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,598
Where's the guard?

216
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:49,439
Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring
at your service, sir.

217
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,158
You are in the United States
Army Stockade at Bad Mondorf.

218
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,398
Did they tell you why you're here?

219
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,558
Because we lost the war.
l assume, to be shot or hanged.

220
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:02,838
lt's up to the Court.

221
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,719
l've heard of this Court.
lts opinion doesn't concern me.

222
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,719
The opinion of the German people
is what really matters.

223
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:10,158
- ls that so?
- lt is so.

224
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:14,118
History will show that everything l did
was for the greater German Reich.

225
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:18,000
There will be statues of Hermann Goring
all over Germany in 50 years.

226
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,439
Little statues, perhaps,
but one in every home.

227
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,560
You're fat as a house.

228
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,440
Starting right now,
l'm putting you on a diet.

229
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,160
You will be mentally and physically fit
to stand trial.

230
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Captain.

231
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Colonel.

232
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,359
- Who is it?
- Hans Frank, sir.

233
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,399
Tried to cut his wrists and throat.

234
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,839
They stopped him
before he could do any damage.

235
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,680
''The Jew Butcher of Krakow.''

236
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
Take him to the infirmary,
have him checked out.

237
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,161
l want a four-man watch on him
around the clock.

238
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,961
- On the double.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:08,361
- Good work, Captain. What's your name?
- Gilbert, sir.

240
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,640
- You and your men want to chow with us?
- Thank you, sir.

241
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,561
- You a surgeon?
- Psychologist.

242
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,681
What we are faced with, or so it appears...

243
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,401
...is the secular equivalent of drafting
the Ten Commandments.

244
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:38,641
Each nation has its criminal statutes,
but for the world at large, none exist.

245
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,201
None are necessary.

246
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:44,561
We're trying war criminals whose guilt
is unquestioned by our governments.

247
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,841
lf we're going to have a trial,
it must be based on law. lt must be a fair--

248
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,082
lt must only determine degree of guilt
and appropriate punishment.

249
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:55,082
A completely fair trial
with opposing counsel...

250
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:57,402
...direct examination
and cross-examination.

251
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,362
Precisely.

252
00:19:58,402 --> 00:20:01,362
- Before judges that act as referees.
- As in a sporting match?

253
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:02,481
Pain in the butt.

254
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:05,402
- That's not how it's done in my country.
- Nor in France.

255
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,041
Lawyers merely help the accused
prepare a defense.

256
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:10,682
They have little role in the court itself.

257
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:15,121
ln the U.S., a defendant is entitled to his
lawyer's most aggressive representation.

258
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:16,402
Yes. As in Britain.

259
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:20,442
You would allow a man
such as Ernst Kaltenbrunner...

260
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,402
...responsible for the Gestapo,
concentration camps...

261
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,081
...for killing millions of innocent people...

262
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:29,241
...to stand before a court of law
and declare himself not guilty?

263
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:32,041
That is precisely what we would allow.

264
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:37,282
Twenty million of my people were killed
by these fascist criminals!

265
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:41,323
Half of them civilians,
killed without mercy!

266
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,602
How many died in Washington this way,
Mr. Justice Jackson?

267
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,442
lt occurs to me that perhaps
separate trials...

268
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:04,962
...might be the most satisfactory way
to reconcile our differences.

269
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:08,722
The U.S. and the British
along with the French, if they choose...

270
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:12,443
...will conduct a trial with the Nazis
that we currently have in captivity.

271
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,842
Kaltenbrunner, Frank, Speer, Goring...

272
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:21,403
The Russians, of course, would be free
to hold their own trial with the ones that...

273
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:22,682
...you have on hand.

274
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,244
There is no need to be so impulsive.

275
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:38,763
We are, after all, allies.

276
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:41,443
We must try to bridge our differences.

277
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:44,003
At least the prosecution is
a unified group now...

278
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:47,724
...even if we did compromise with
the French and let the judges be the jury.

279
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:51,804
l must say, your neat little trump card
turned Comrade General into a pussycat.

280
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,004
l didn't enjoy playing it.
l didn't want to sandbag the poor guy.

281
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:57,044
l would've preferred to convince him.

282
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:59,923
The old boy was quite convinced
by your subtle reminder...

283
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:04,443
...that we've got most of the big Nazi fish,
while they only have a couple of minnows.

284
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:12,563
Nonetheless,
l couldn't argue with his point.

285
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:16,043
My country was spared the worst of it.
No bombed-out cities.

286
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:19,724
No slaughtered children.
l couldn't begin to know.

287
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,564
How can you look at all this...

288
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:26,884
...and still want to guarantee
these men a vigorous defense?

289
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:29,164
l want to put National Socialism on trial.

290
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,684
So they'll incriminate themselves.

291
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,765
Besides, l don't want this to happen again.

292
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,405
There's no question,
you're the undisputed leader in this.

293
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:43,924
Today proved that.

294
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:48,485
When we finish our work here,
go to Germany, find a place for the trial.

295
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,404
lf anything still exists, that is.

296
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:34,926
Robert, l can't believe this.

297
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:40,006
My brother came here as a college student.
l still have the picture book he brought me.

298
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,966
lt was nothing like this.
This isn't even the same city.

299
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,086
There were medieval bridges
and gingerbread houses.

300
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:49,726
This was also the site
of some of Hitler's biggest rallies.

301
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:52,846
Nuremberg was the spiritual center
of the Third Reich.

302
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:58,007
What are the odds of finding the housing
we'll need for the thousands of people...

303
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,487
...who'll attend the trial?

304
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:00,967
Army guarantees it.

305
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:04,207
Parts of this city were untouched
by the bombings.

306
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,487
There's hundreds of fine houses.
Some vacant.

307
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,926
Others whose owners are desperate
for money.

308
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,366
What's that smell?

309
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:13,447
There's still around 30,000 bodies
trapped under the rubble.

310
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,126
- Ready?
- Yeah.

311
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,287
Follow me.

312
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,126
The grand old Palace of Justice.

313
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,326
A landmark in more ways than one.

314
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:32,246
lt took five bomb hits,
but just shrugged them off.

315
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,606
Attention!

316
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:41,646
The courtroom's upstairs.
Offices, that whole wing there.

317
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,048
And behind that wall,
all the jail cells you'll need.

318
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,288
Right this way.

319
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,367
Justice Jackson, the courtroom.

320
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,527
This is a mess.

321
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,887
lt'll take a lot of work.

322
00:25:06,928 --> 00:25:08,968
- A lot of work.
- But it's doable.

323
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:10,807
Bob?

324
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,208
The Ten Commandments.

325
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,687
The Ten Commandments, in the place
where the Nuremberg Laws were decreed...

326
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:26,567
...that deprived all German Jews
of their rights.

327
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:30,969
This is it.

328
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:33,409
This is the place to hold the trial.

329
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,249
Give me the word. l'll have General Patton
move in 15,000 German POWs...

330
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,448
...and start cleaning up the whole city.

331
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,368
l'm giving you that word right now.

332
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:44,168
Captain Kiley, what do you think?

333
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:48,969
l'll need to double the size
of the courtroom.

334
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:53,048
l'll have to take out that rear wall
and cut into the attic for a visitor's gallery.

335
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:56,128
- l saw some terrific seats in an old theater.
- Great.

336
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:59,288
The chandelier has got to go.
Fluorescent's more practical...

337
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:02,808
The Palace of Justice is going
to see justice once again.

338
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:05,929
Sir, this was just forwarded from the base.

339
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:10,449
- Thank you very much, Sergeant...
- Fuchs. Morris Fuchs, Brooklyn, New York.

340
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:14,408
Well, l knew it wasn't Wisconsin
with that accent, Fuchs. Thank you.

341
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,890
President Truman wants
to appoint Francis Biddle...

342
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,809
...as the U.S. judge for the trial.

343
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,090
Are you serious?

344
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,170
He fired Biddle as Attorney General.
Why would he do that?

345
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,009
Guilt, maybe. Probably.

346
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,089
- l guess, it's this instead of a gold watch.
- How do you feel about that?

347
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,289
Read Truman's wording:
''Unless you have a problem with this.''

348
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,809
- Which means--
- ''Don't have a problem with this.''

349
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,689
l've got to go back to Washington
and brief Truman anyway.

350
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,450
l can stop in Philadelphia
along the way and...

351
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:48,049
...try to cajole Biddle
to become a team player.

352
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,490
When do we leave?

353
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:57,250
l need you to stay here, set up our office,
and find us a place to stay.

354
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:02,809
- Make those decisions without you?
- That'll be fine. l trust you.

355
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,290
Bob?

356
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:21,931
When your name is called,
get your ass on the truck.

357
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,530
When you board the plane,
get a seat by the window, dear boy.

358
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:33,691
lt maybe the last view
we have of the fatherland.

359
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,530
l couldn't face going back
into private practice.

360
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,330
Not after all those years in Washington
at the nerve center of the country, the war.

361
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,892
What is the current status in Nuremberg?

362
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:01,372
We're gathering evidence,
choosing defendants.

363
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:03,451
We've settled on 22 men.

364
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,572
We've narrowed our targets to those
who ran the concentration camps.

365
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,132
Good thinking, splendid.

366
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:12,571
The ones who gathered the slave labor,
as well as those that used it.

367
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,092
Absolutely right!

368
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:18,571
The judges have a great deal of work ahead
of them with the pretrial discoveries.

369
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:23,171
Well, of course,
you'll be there to guide me through it.

370
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,731
l'm thrilled, Bob. lt's an honor.

371
00:28:26,531 --> 00:28:29,211
This means a great deal to me.

372
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:36,532
Am l safe in calling the President
and telling him you've signed off on me?

373
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:39,531
That l'm approved
as Chief American Judge?

374
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,172
l'll arrange your flight this week.

375
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,893
We need you there as quickly as possible.
We need to gear up fast.

376
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:49,413
The trial's in one month.

377
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:52,492
We'll have dessert in Nuremberg.

378
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:01,773
All right, all right, okay. Slow down.
Take it easy.

379
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,612
l've got to say...

380
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:24,893
...l find it a little unnerving walking past
300 German POWs carrying pickaxes.

381
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:28,252
You've got a bodyguard.
Just let one of them try to mess with you.

382
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,813
You want the desk sideways?

383
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,173
No, light from the side
gives him a headache.

384
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:34,293
You really take good care of this guy.

385
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:35,614
That's my job.

386
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:36,653
That's fine?

387
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,213
Perfect. Could you please find
Captain Kiley?

388
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:42,334
- l wonder if the filing cabinets are ready.
- Sure thing.

389
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:02,734
The first thing you must understand about
these men is that they are war criminals.

390
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:04,534
Their rank means nothing.

391
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:08,614
There is to be no exchanging of salutes
or any other military courtesies.

392
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,374
Now, l know most of you men saw combat.

393
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:15,214
You lost friends, companions.

394
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:18,533
We've all seen the bodies
at the side of the road.

395
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:21,413
Men who gave their lives
in the service of their country...

396
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:26,254
...so that we might have the opportunity
to bring these criminals to justice.

397
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:30,454
Our job is to make sure that
these criminals survive long enough...

398
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:32,615
...to have that justice served.

399
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:36,535
To make sure that our friends,
our companions, did not die in vain.

400
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,014
That'll be all.

401
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:40,254
Attention!

402
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:10,215
On your feet.

403
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:15,135
Swab your cell.

404
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:16,615
l beg your pardon?

405
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:20,375
Der bucket.

406
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,136
And der mop.

407
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:23,615
Use them!

408
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:26,735
Pick it up!

409
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,096
Pick them up! Now!

410
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:33,335
Pick them up!

411
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,375
Lieutenant!

412
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:42,655
Back off!

413
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:47,695
Easy. Okay.

414
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:50,135
Put him down.

415
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,616
Colonel!

416
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:05,537
Doctor?

417
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:08,616
He'll rest now.

418
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:12,777
His heart rate was up
to almost three hundred beats per minute.

419
00:32:13,336 --> 00:32:15,096
lt could've led to heart failure.

420
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,616
That's just great. That's just what l need.

421
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:21,336
To lose the biggest bull in the roundup.

422
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,896
- Lieutenant?
- Wheelis, sir.

423
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:27,177
l'm making this man your personal
responsibility. He is not to exert himself.

424
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:32,257
As God is my witness, he'll be in the best
of health when they hang him.

425
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:33,616
Yes, sir.

426
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:38,336
Lieutenant.

427
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:40,096
Lieutenant Wheelis.

428
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,936
With your permission, l shall call you:

429
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:45,896
Leutnant.

430
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:49,298
- That's fine, sir.
- Good.

431
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,857
- Thanks for the ride, Fuchs.
- No problem.

432
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:11,097
Robert!

433
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,018
- Welcome back.
- lt's nice to be back.

434
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:17,017
lt's really good to have you back.

435
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:19,738
So...

436
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:24,617
- Quite a job you've done here.
- You should see the inside. Come on.

437
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,219
Excellent. Excellent work, Captain...

438
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:40,298
Kiley.

439
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,699
Kiley. What's your background, Kiley?

440
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:45,459
A couple of architecture classes.
Never got a degree.

441
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:46,818
Neither did l.

442
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:48,819
Are you serious?

443
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,538
You're a justice of the Supreme Court.

444
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:55,699
l practiced law for 20 years with only
a single year of law school under my belt.

445
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:57,338
Things were easier back then.

446
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:00,899
- You shouldn't give away your secrets.
- l won't tell if you won't tell.

447
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:04,338
How are we doing with the gizmos
for the simultaneous translation?

448
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,539
lBM's inventing the process as we go, sir.
But we'll be ready for you, l promise.

449
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:10,178
l don't doubt that.

450
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,378
Excuse me.

451
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:14,458
Question is, ''Will we be ready?''

452
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:18,179
The whole team's waiting in our office.
They'll fill you in.

453
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,018
l missed you.

454
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,460
l missed you, too.

455
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,139
When l was home,
l couldn't find a phone number.

456
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,779
l couldn't find a document.

457
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,420
Now you won't have to worry about that.

458
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,380
l'll take Goring.

459
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,059
Should be fun.

460
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,700
Tom, l'd like you to do Speer.

461
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,940
My pleasure.

462
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,500
l'd also like you to take
von Schirach and Funk.

463
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:46,420
Good.

464
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:51,460
- Are the indictments ready to be served?
- l say we hold off till the last moment.

465
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:55,460
As it is, we get to treat them like POWs.
We can interrogate them all day long.

466
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Once indicted, they're entitled
to have their lawyers present.

467
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,660
This is going to be a fair trial.

468
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:04,699
Let's serve them as soon as possible.
Let the British deliver the indictments.

469
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,140
lt's not right for us to hog the whole show.

470
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:10,019
- What if they want Nazi lawyers?
- Hell, no!

471
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,141
- What crazy example would that set?
- Free speech.

472
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,300
For crying out loud, boys!

473
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:18,461
Nazis defending Nazis.
They ought to be on trial themselves.

474
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,621
We have to pay them?

475
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,981
l wonder what these fellows would do
if the situation was reversed.

476
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,661
We don't have to answer
that question in this room.

477
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,820
The judges will be here in one week.
We'll let them decide. Will you excuse me?

478
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,701
This just arrived from Biddle.

479
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,860
He's decided not to fly.

480
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,780
He's coming over on the Queen Elizabeth.
He'll be here in three weeks.

481
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,941
l'm a bit surprised at Biddle.

482
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:52,820
l'd never seen a man
so hungry for approval.

483
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:56,021
Well, yeah, but then you approved him.

484
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,260
l did learn a lesson there, didn't l?

485
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,342
And how l hate learning lessons.

486
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,701
Don't you think this is a bit excessive?

487
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,862
l got it for a really good price.

488
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,101
Thank you.

489
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:23,461
Justice Jackson,
meet Frau Hassel and Herr Hassel.

490
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:24,742
Willkommen.

491
00:36:26,862 --> 00:36:29,702
How do you do?
l have lived five years in America.

492
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:33,302
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,
Frau Hassel.

493
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:35,061
Please, come in.

494
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,422
Follow me, bitte.

495
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:44,581
l will prepare dinner.
Something light, perhaps, at this hour.

496
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,741
Thank you.

497
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:50,903
''Light'' means five pounds of lard
in the dumplings instead of six.

498
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:53,623
Who owns this place?

499
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:58,623
Some banker who no longer owns a bank.
l think we're his only source of income.

500
00:36:58,702 --> 00:36:59,702
Come on.

501
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,863
Thank you, Herr Hassel. l'll do that.

502
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,342
Danke schon.

503
00:37:16,463 --> 00:37:18,063
So where is your room?

504
00:37:18,382 --> 00:37:19,542
Upstairs.

505
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:22,663
lt's a cute little attic-apartment type thing.

506
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:24,143
ls it all right?

507
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:27,143
Well, it's nicer than what l have
in Washington, Bob.

508
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:30,103
l haven't seen what you have
in Washington.

509
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:33,902
Oh God, l am so bushed.

510
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:36,783
Just hold on till dinner.
Would you like a drink?

511
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:38,504
No, maybe later on.

512
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:41,503
Don't do that.

513
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:46,023
l've arranged a breakfast meeting
with the team tomorrow morning.

514
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:47,183
Good.

515
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,384
Just to go over some finer points.

516
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:53,944
You sure pack well, Bob.

517
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:05,423
Bob.

518
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:23,623
Thanks.

519
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:33,544
Start with this one.

520
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:38,064
- l hope l shan't make a balls of it.
- You'll be just fine, old chap. Open up.

521
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:46,865
Good morning.

522
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,065
l am Major Neave.

523
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,304
l am the officer appointed
by the lnternational Military Tribunal to--

524
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:54,505
Wait.

525
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:57,184
- You're British?
- l am.

526
00:38:57,784 --> 00:38:59,784
Finally, a civilized man.

527
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:02,545
Neave.

528
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:06,544
What is your given name?

529
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:07,985
Airey.

530
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:11,105
Major Airey Neave.

531
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:13,585
l have heard this name before.

532
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:15,826
Airey, like the wind.

533
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:19,346
Why would l have heard this name?

534
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:24,465
l was captured, tortured by the Gestapo,
and escaped twice.

535
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:27,385
l see.
Then you've earned your given name.

536
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:31,666
l am the officer appointed
by the lnternational Military Tribunal...

537
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:34,106
...to serve upon you
a copy of the indictment...

538
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,786
...in which you are named as defendant.

539
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:39,826
l'm also here to advise you
as to your rights to counsel.

540
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:42,226
l care nothing for lawyers.

541
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:46,306
You can find one for me,
Major Airey of the wind.

542
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:48,705
We're men of culture.

543
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:50,585
We both know the truth.

544
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,146
The victors will always be the judges.

545
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:55,785
The vanquished, always the accused.

546
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:56,905
Yes?

547
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:21,266
Open it up.

548
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:29,346
Until l've studied this, l cannot speak
to the accuracy of the charges against me.

549
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:33,547
But l acknowledge the necessity
of this trial and accept...

550
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:35,747
...my inclusion in it.

551
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:38,187
How can you say that
before reading the charges?

552
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:41,186
There's a common responsibility
for the crimes committed...

553
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:44,386
...in the name of the Third Reich.
No one is blameless.

554
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,507
Apart from the victims.

555
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:48,427
But we were just following orders!

556
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:50,827
l know nothing
about crimes against humanity.

557
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,748
- Here's a list of lawyers.
- Jews!

558
00:40:53,188 --> 00:40:54,588
They're all Jew names!

559
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:57,068
l want to be defended
by a German naval officer.

560
00:40:57,148 --> 00:41:00,148
l was a lawyer myself, full of ideals.

561
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,987
Why don't you just shoot us now?

562
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:07,427
Why don't you shoot us now?

563
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:54,909
l want a guard posted
at the porthole of every cell.

564
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:58,268
They are to be watched around the clock!

565
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:04,668
l will not have them taking
the easy way out!

566
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:18,269
- l need to pick up a document.
- l'll meet you in the office.

567
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:27,228
- Find any directives on Polish slave labor?
- Take your pick.

568
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:30,389
There's something peculiar
about the German character.

569
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:33,469
Makes them keep detailed records
of everything they do.

570
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,990
lt's downright perverse.

571
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:39,830
The Nazis put into writing
every criminal thought they ever had...

572
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:42,230
...and every criminal act they ever did.

573
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,070
ln this room is enough evidence
to hang half the country.

574
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,230
l'll settle for 21 clean convictions.

575
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,990
- Get what you need?
- More than.

576
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,829
l've arranged all your random notes
for the opening statement...

577
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:07,710
...into something less random.

578
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,190
Legal, Thematic, Anecdotal,
Precedent, Theory.

579
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:15,309
You're really something.

580
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,550
When you decide what, let me know.

581
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,390
Oh, my God!

582
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,431
l don't believe this.

583
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,070
l've noticed that this case
has inspired the orator in you.

584
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,270
l tried to capture a tone, a mood,
for the entire case.

585
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,871
A melancholy grandeur, if you will.

586
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:08,031
Well, it's all here.

587
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:15,071
You have a...

588
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,432
...something right here.

589
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:29,351
We only have two days
to finish the speech.

590
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:32,512
Maybe you should start dictating.

591
00:44:35,032 --> 00:44:35,751
Right.

592
00:44:55,992 --> 00:45:00,393
This simultaneous translation business
is like taking a room in the Tower of Babel.

593
00:45:01,353 --> 00:45:04,793
l can assure you, whoever designed
those electronic earmuffs--

594
00:45:04,873 --> 00:45:06,313
Earphones, Sir Geoffrey.

595
00:45:06,632 --> 00:45:11,592
Earphones. Whoever designed them
did not try them over a barrister's wig!

596
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,153
Not to worry.
On you, they'll be most becoming.

597
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:16,592
That'll change my style...

598
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:18,313
Who's that over there?

599
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:22,913
He's a psychologist. The army
transferred him here to consult...

600
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:25,313
...on the suicide risks among the prisoners.

601
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:38,312
l had arranged for a flight to pick you up.

602
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:40,432
You were meant to be here two weeks ago.

603
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:43,353
What happened?
You developed a craving for shuffleboard?

604
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:46,793
l just l needed time to get up to speed.

605
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:48,793
l worked the whole way over.

606
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:50,394
l'm fully prepared.

607
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:54,034
Any of my colleagues here?
l'd like to meet them.

608
00:45:54,153 --> 00:45:57,074
Perhaps later on.
l need to talk to you about something.

609
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:00,834
- You must take some vodka.
- No, thank you.

610
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:03,954
- Try it. lt makes it strong.
- l am content with the cognac.

611
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:07,634
- We do it all the time in Russia.
- You can't mix it.

612
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:10,193
- We do it in Russia all the time.
- Not in France.

613
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:11,834
Thank you. Thank you.

614
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:15,954
Look at this, Bob.

615
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:19,514
lt was a gift from my family.

616
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:24,034
After the trial l will donate this,
along with my papers, to my alma mater.

617
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:26,354
- l think future generations--
- Francis...

618
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:31,235
On the subject of who will serve
as President of the Court...

619
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:34,914
...the British are prepared
to support you, but...

620
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:37,275
Yes?

621
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,715
lt's not in the best interests of the trial.

622
00:46:40,394 --> 00:46:43,514
The Americans are far too dominant
in this thing already.

623
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,875
The trial must be viewed as a joint effort.

624
00:46:46,195 --> 00:46:48,914
- l really do have the qualifications.
- l know you do.

625
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:53,274
lf not me, then who?

626
00:46:53,514 --> 00:46:54,954
Sir Geoffrey Lawrence.

627
00:46:55,635 --> 00:46:58,075
The British share our sensibilities.

628
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:01,795
That's a lot better than having
de Vabres or, God knows, Nikitchenko.

629
00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:04,715
l think l can sell the French
on this idea too.

630
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:10,034
Everyone back home assumes
that l will be head of the Court.

631
00:47:10,114 --> 00:47:13,834
Francis, your role here will be
of incredible importance.

632
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:19,596
This is probably the last appointment
of my career, Bob.

633
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:21,476
This is how l'm going out.

634
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:25,836
With great honor.
Francis, you'll be capping your career...

635
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:27,635
...with great honor.

636
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:43,396
Now that Ley's done himself in...

637
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:46,276
...who should we get
to replace him in the dock?

638
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,916
lt's not a Broadway show.
We don't just bring out an understudy.

639
00:47:49,956 --> 00:47:52,596
We've still got 21 left. lt's a good number.

640
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:54,315
Boys, they are coming back.

641
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,955
- Biddle doesn't look too happy.
- Can you blame him?

642
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:03,076
Gentlemen, l'd like to introduce
Judge Francis Biddle.

643
00:48:03,195 --> 00:48:05,036
Hello, sir. Pleased to see you.

644
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:18,277
Ladies and gentlemen.

645
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:20,117
Please.

646
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:23,836
A salute to my colleagues in the law.

647
00:48:24,757 --> 00:48:28,836
How fortunate we are to be in a profession
where we may speak our minds.

648
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:32,797
Not like diplomats who must behave
like dogs on a leash.

649
00:48:37,677 --> 00:48:39,757
To the law!

650
00:48:44,317 --> 00:48:46,797
l was wondering
if you'd care to dance with me?

651
00:48:48,077 --> 00:48:49,797
l'm not much of a dancer.

652
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:52,956
Well, let's go embarrass ourselves.

653
00:49:27,157 --> 00:49:30,197
lt's my opinion head-shrinking
has no place in this man's army.

654
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:34,237
But you've been assigned to me, Captain,
and l plan to make full use of you.

655
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,998
You'll help me stop losing
any more of my prisoners.

656
00:49:37,237 --> 00:49:39,397
From what l know of your set-up here...

657
00:49:39,478 --> 00:49:42,358
...l can say that you've created
the perfect suicide ward.

658
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,998
What are you talking about?

659
00:49:44,077 --> 00:49:47,278
These men have nothing to do all day
but think about their faith.

660
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:48,598
They should.

661
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:50,358
To keep them alive and sane...

662
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:53,118
...they need to be occupied,
mentally and physically.

663
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,358
- A small library, for instance.
- Library?

664
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:57,598
Would make all the difference in the world.

665
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:59,159
So would an exercise yard.

666
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:01,358
l had something quite different in mind.

667
00:50:01,518 --> 00:50:03,158
Put you in their lives.

668
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,519
Give them somebody to talk to,
open up with.

669
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:07,559
They'll surely jump at the chance...

670
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,119
...to jibber-jabber with somebody as bright
and enthusiastic as yourself.

671
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:13,878
They'll tell you what they're thinking
and planning.

672
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:16,798
You'll report everything you hear to me.

673
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:18,239
Colonel--

674
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:20,759
l will not hear anything
about morals and ethics.

675
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,838
These men are prisoners. Criminals.

676
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,278
Not patients.

677
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,519
That's the deal, Captain.
Take it or leave it.

678
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:34,000
The library and the exercise yard, sir?

679
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:36,199
You got it.

680
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,320
This place is worse than l expected.
What a nightmare.

681
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,440
- Where do we pick up our press passes?
- The Palace of Justice.

682
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,960
What's the metal bar
on the front of the jeep do?

683
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,279
lt cuts the wires that Germans string
across the road at night.

684
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,559
Several Gl's have already been decapitated.

685
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,599
Lovely.

686
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,400
Here we are, gentlemen.
l'll take your bags to the hotel.

687
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:04,000
All right. Thanks a lot, buddy.
See you around.

688
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,719
Have press credentials ready to show.
You will be given press passes...

689
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:13,079
...and transferred to assigned lodging.
Get in line, gentlemen!

690
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,880
Check this out.

691
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,081
Nice and tight, please.

692
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:48,721
We better go sign in.

693
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:05,801
- Rudolf, you put it on the wrong foot.
- What?

694
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,040
The shoe.

695
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:08,881
Na ja.

696
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,161
Hess seems completely mad.

697
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,481
lt is an act. He is being clever.

698
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:19,802
lf he was so clever, he wouldn't have spent
the last four years in an English prison.

699
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:31,561
l turned my diaries over
to the Americans, voluntarily.

700
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:37,082
That proves that l tried to resign
as Governor-General of Poland.

701
00:52:38,762 --> 00:52:41,802
l did not approve
of the persecution of the Jews.

702
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:47,121
Anyone reading my diaries,
they will know what was in my heart.

703
00:52:48,242 --> 00:52:52,042
They will understand that
those things l wrote about the Jews...

704
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:54,402
...the orders l signed...

705
00:52:55,762 --> 00:52:57,402
...they were not sincere.

706
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,402
l believe you, Herr Frank.

707
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:08,563
And yet, you did do those things.

708
00:53:10,202 --> 00:53:11,643
How do you explain it?

709
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:15,402
l don't mean legally.
l'm not a lawyer or a judge.

710
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,803
l mean, how do you explain it to yourself?

711
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:25,202
l don't know.

712
00:53:31,123 --> 00:53:33,003
lt's as though l am two people.

713
00:53:35,322 --> 00:53:39,242
The Hans Frank you see here,
and Hans Frank, the Nazi leader.

714
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:44,282
l wonder how that other Frank
could do those things.

715
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:49,443
This Frank looks at that Frank and says:

716
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:54,324
''You are a terrible man.''

717
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:57,164
And what does that Frank say back?

718
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:58,164
He says:

719
00:53:59,244 --> 00:54:01,284
''l just wanted to keep my job.''

720
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:07,003
Friends.

721
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:11,004
When we begin this grotesque farce
tomorrow, my friends...

722
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:14,483
...never forget that we're here
for one reason.

723
00:54:14,844 --> 00:54:16,684
And one reason only.

724
00:54:17,643 --> 00:54:19,923
We lost the war.

725
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:25,403
But someday, a grateful German nation...

726
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:28,244
...will honor our legacy.

727
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:33,003
Doctor!

728
00:54:34,364 --> 00:54:36,485
What do you have if you have one German?

729
00:54:37,885 --> 00:54:39,405
You have a fine man.

730
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:41,925
Two Germans, a Bund.

731
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:45,844
Three Germans? A war!

732
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,405
Are you really in such a good mood,
Herr Goring?

733
00:54:52,085 --> 00:54:54,045
Or is this your way of handling fear?

734
00:54:58,844 --> 00:54:59,684
Fear?

735
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,605
What do l have to be afraid of?

736
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:06,804
l've ordered thousands of men
into battle knowing full well...

737
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:08,525
...that not many would return.

738
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:13,565
Why should l, their leader, tremble
when called upon to face the enemy?

739
00:55:15,005 --> 00:55:19,365
l know that l'm a condemned man.
That is of no consequence.

740
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:24,686
There is still work to be done.
And, mark my words, it will be done.

741
00:55:28,606 --> 00:55:31,086
One Englishman? An idiot.

742
00:55:31,885 --> 00:55:33,846
Two Englishmen? A club.

743
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:37,085
Three Englishmen, an empire!

744
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:49,045
l spoke with the translators today...

745
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:51,646
...to get a sense of the pace
you need to maintain.

746
00:55:51,726 --> 00:55:53,885
lt's tricky. lt's not just about pace.

747
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,006
lt's about rhythm,
pausing at the end of phrases.

748
00:55:57,085 --> 00:55:58,965
We should rehearse a little tonight.

749
00:55:59,045 --> 00:56:01,485
Not the whole speech.
You need to save your voice.

750
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:08,806
This is unbelievable.

751
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,487
Open them up.

752
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:58,126
- Good morning, Leutnant Wheelis.
- Good morning, sir.

753
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:00,366
lt's time to go, Reichsmarschall.

754
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:03,648
How do l look?

755
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,728
You look fine, sir. How do you feel?

756
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:13,007
Excited. l have waited many months.
Many months of silence.

757
00:57:13,648 --> 00:57:15,448
Now at last l'm being heard.

758
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:21,528
- Shall we?
- l'm not allowed to do that, sir.

759
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:23,288
Yes, of course.

760
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,087
Bring them out!

761
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:33,167
Hitch them up!

762
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:42,087
Pull them out!

763
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:51,768
All right, Sergeant, search the cells.

764
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,370
Sir Geoffrey.

765
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,371
With my respects.

766
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:58,451
Bless you, Biddle.

767
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,170
After you.

768
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,490
All rise!

769
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:54,692
This trial, which is now to begin...

770
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:58,452
...is unique in the annals of jurisprudence.

771
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:04,813
The defendants, all having been served
with copies of the indictments...

772
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:07,093
...are now to enter their pleas.

773
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:10,572
Hermann Goring.

774
01:01:11,132 --> 01:01:14,413
l have a statement
which l will now read to the court.

775
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:17,413
The defendants are not to make a speech.

776
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:19,292
They are only to enter a plea.

777
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:25,572
l declare myself, in the sense of
the indictment, nicht schuldig. Not guilty.

778
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,172
Rudolf Hess.

779
01:01:27,773 --> 01:01:29,213
Nein, nein.

780
01:01:29,893 --> 01:01:31,773
Record that as ''not guilty.''

781
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:36,773

782
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:39,932

01:01:57,893 --> 01:02:00,853
- Walther Funk.

01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:03,973
- Hjalmar Schacht.
- Nicht schuldig.

790
01:02:04,293 --> 01:02:06,933
- Karl Donitz.
- Nicht schuldig.

791
01:02:07,134 --> 01:02:09,773
- Erich Raeder.
- Nicht schuldig.

792
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:12,173

01:02:12,373 --> 01:02:14,613
- Fritz Sauckel.
- Nicht schuldig.

794
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,653
- Alfred Jodl.

01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:19,293

01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:22,134

01:02:28,534 --> 01:02:30,974
- And Hans Fritzsche.
- Nicht schuldig.

800
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,334
All the pleas have now been entered.

801
01:02:36,454 --> 01:02:37,534
Justice Jackson.

802
01:02:38,094 --> 01:02:40,094
Your opening address, please.

803
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,054
May it please your honors.

804
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:55,015
The privilege of opening
the first trial in history...

805
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:57,894
...for crimes against
the peace of the world...

806
01:02:58,534 --> 01:03:00,454
...imposes a grave responsibility.

807
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:06,735
The wrongs which we seek to condemn
and punish have been so calculated...

808
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:09,215
...so malignant, and so devastating...

809
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:12,735
...that civilization cannot tolerate
their being ignored...

810
01:03:12,815 --> 01:03:15,695
...because it cannot survive
their being repeated.

811
01:03:18,175 --> 01:03:22,455
That four great nations, flushed
with victory and stung with injury...

812
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:26,695
...stay the hand of vengeance and
voluntarily submit their captive enemies...

813
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:28,535
...to the judgment of the law...

814
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:33,215
...is one of the most significant tributes
that Power has ever paid to Reason.

815
01:03:34,615 --> 01:03:40,096
lf these men are the first war leaders
of a defeated nation to be prosecuted...

816
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:42,655
...in the name of the law...

817
01:03:43,295 --> 01:03:47,215
...we agree that here they must be given
a presumption of innocence.

818
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:50,056
We accept the burden...

819
01:03:50,976 --> 01:03:53,215
...of proving criminal acts...

820
01:03:53,615 --> 01:03:55,536
...and the responsibility...

821
01:03:55,936 --> 01:03:59,776
...of these defendants for their commission.

822
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:03,896
We have no purpose here...

823
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,776
...to incriminate the whole German people.

824
01:04:08,655 --> 01:04:12,175
Hitler did not achieve power
by majority vote, but seized it...

825
01:04:12,775 --> 01:04:15,855
...by an evil alliance of revolutionists...

826
01:04:16,695 --> 01:04:18,177
...reactionaries...

827
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:20,257
...and militarists.

828
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:25,817
You will hear today and in the days ahead
of the enormity and the horror...

829
01:04:26,177 --> 01:04:27,617
...of their acts.

830
01:04:28,336 --> 01:04:31,056
The prosecution will give you
undeniable proofs...

831
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:33,577
...of these incredible events.

832
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:39,656
l count myself as one who received, during
this war, atrocity tales with suspicion...

833
01:04:40,817 --> 01:04:43,657
...or skepticism. No more.

834
01:04:45,817 --> 01:04:49,617
The catalogue of crimes will omit nothing
that could be conceived...

835
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:53,896
...by their pathological pride, cruelty,
and lust for power.

836
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:58,616
You will hear of the repression
of organized labor.

837
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:02,457
The harassment of the Church,
the persecution of the Jews.

838
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:06,217
The conversion of mere anti-Semitism
into the deliberate...

839
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:09,457
...extermination of the Jews of Europe.

840
01:05:10,938 --> 01:05:13,657
You'll hear of the long series
of German aggressions...

841
01:05:13,697 --> 01:05:16,377
...and conquests and broken treaties.

842
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:19,138
The terror that settled over Germany.

843
01:05:19,338 --> 01:05:22,298
The havoc wrought
on the occupied territories.

844
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:29,298
And you'll know that the real complaining
party at your bar is Civilization.

845
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:35,577
Civilization asks whether law is so laggard
as to be utterly helpless...

846
01:05:35,858 --> 01:05:38,618
...to deal with crimes of this magnitude...

847
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,858
...by criminals of this order of importance.

848
01:05:45,137 --> 01:05:49,978
lt does not expect
that you can make war impossible.

849
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:56,458
lt does expect that your juridical action
will put the forces of international law...

850
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:05,019
...its precepts, its prohibitions
and, above all, its sanctions...

851
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,739
...on the side of peace.

852
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:14,579
So that men and women
of good will in all countries...

853
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:23,058
...may have leave to live
by no man's leave, underneath the law.

854
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:34,739
The court is now adjourned.

855
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:54,300
Jackson's speech? Pedantic. Tiresome
lot of nothing. l nodded off twice.

856
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,219
The food is better today. Do you think
they'll feed us like this every day?

857
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,740
They always feed you well
before they hang you.

858
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,820
That's so true.

859
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,260
They can't hang us. We're soldiers.
They have to shoot us.

860
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:11,579
Stop this talk.
We must concentrate on our defense.

861
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:20,139
lf you are not going to eat, Frank,
give it to me.

862
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:23,099
lt's a crime to waste such good food.

863
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,619
Look what they have done
to your beautiful city.

864
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:31,019
- Nuremberg is not mine.
- But it was.

865
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,701
Was anything ever more extraordinary than
the Parteitagen you staged in September?

866
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:40,780
The night skies lit up like a bonfire as we
carried our torches through the streets.

867
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,980
A quarter million of us
on our way to the Zeppelin Fields.

868
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,860
l remember standing there for hours,
basking in the radiance of the Fuhrer.

869
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,820
Then l would take a group
of my Hitlerjugend to the river...

870
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,740
...where we'd would bathe together.

871
01:07:57,501 --> 01:08:00,821
We'd cool off from the fires
that were burning within us.

872
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:05,820
But now that just seems like a dream.

873
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:10,501
A strange, wonderful, frightening dream.

874
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,181
lt was not a dream, it was a nightmare...

875
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:16,661
...of our own making.
And it's time to wake up from it.

876
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,741
The look in Hitler's eyes was not radiance,
it was madness.

877
01:08:28,181 --> 01:08:30,301
ls the British prosecution ready?

878
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:32,421
Yes. lndeed we are.

879
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:36,902
Your Honors, with permission
l wish to read from a sworn affidavit...

880
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:39,542
...by one Hermann Friedrich Graebe.

881
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:43,622
A German construction manager who,
in a civilian capacity...

882
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:48,862
...was employed by the German Army
in occupied Ukraine from 1941 to 1944.

883
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:54,301
On several occasions he observed...

884
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:59,661
...the mass murders of local Jews
committed by the SS...

885
01:08:59,981 --> 01:09:06,502
...or Schutzstaffel, the Nazi party's police
and security organization.

886
01:09:06,782 --> 01:09:08,061
One such occasion...

887
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:13,023
...he writes,
took place on October 5, 1942...

888
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,302
...near the city of Dobno.

889
01:09:16,382 --> 01:09:19,302
That morning, Herr Graebe was informed...

890
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:24,743
...that all 5,000 Jews from that city...

891
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:31,342
...were to be taken by SS trucks
to a place near his building site...

892
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:33,863
...where they were to be shot...

893
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,383
...and buried in large pits.

894
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:41,542
He continues.

895
01:09:41,823 --> 01:09:47,262
''Thereupon l drove to the site
and saw near it great mounds of earth.

896
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:51,063
''Several SS trucks stood in front of them.

897
01:09:51,703 --> 01:09:54,143
''l heard rifle shots, in quick succession...

898
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:57,264
''...coming from behind
one of the earth mounds.

899
01:09:57,863 --> 01:10:03,423
''Those who had just got off the trucks,
men, women and children of all ages...

900
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:09,423
''...had to undress upon the order
of an SS man, who carried a whip.

901
01:10:10,104 --> 01:10:13,503
''All these people had the regulation
yellow patch on their clothes...

902
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,623
''...and thus could be recognized as Jews.

903
01:10:17,623 --> 01:10:20,103
''And without screaming or weeping...

904
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:25,344
''...these people undressed,
stood around in family groups...

905
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:30,584
''...kissed each other, said their farewells.

906
01:10:31,823 --> 01:10:34,903
''l watched a family of about eight,
a man and a woman...

907
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:37,503
''...with their children
and two grown-up daughters.

908
01:10:37,663 --> 01:10:43,384
''An old woman with snow-white hair was
holding the youngest, perhaps a year old...

909
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:50,425
''...in her arms and singing to it, tickling it,
and the child was cooing with delight.

910
01:10:51,704 --> 01:10:56,184
''All the people around
were looking on with tears in their eyes.

911
01:10:57,225 --> 01:11:00,385
''The father was holding the hand
of a boy about 10 years old...

912
01:11:00,664 --> 01:11:05,784
''...and speaking to him softly.
The boy was fighting his tears.

913
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:11,144
''The father pointed to the sky,
stroked the boy's head...

914
01:11:12,864 --> 01:11:15,304
''...seemed to explain something to him.

915
01:11:18,505 --> 01:11:21,625
''At that moment, the SS man at the pit
shouted to his comrades.

916
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:26,465
''The latter counted off about 30 persons
and instructed them...

917
01:11:26,545 --> 01:11:28,505
''...to go behind the earth mound.

918
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:31,265
''Among them was the family
that l have mentioned.

919
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:35,345
''l well remember a girl,
slim and with black hair, who...

920
01:11:35,426 --> 01:11:39,826
''...as she passed close to me,
pointed to herself and said:

921
01:11:40,985 --> 01:11:42,586
'''Twenty-three.'

922
01:11:43,105 --> 01:11:48,746
''l then walked around the mound,
and was confronted by an enormous grave.

923
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:53,905
''People were closely wedged together
and lying on top of each other so that...

924
01:11:54,386 --> 01:11:56,226
''...only their heads were visible.

925
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:59,466
''Nearly all had blood running
over their shoulders.

926
01:12:00,185 --> 01:12:04,185
''Some of the people shot
were still moving.

927
01:12:04,865 --> 01:12:08,105
''Some were lifting their arms
and turning their heads...

928
01:12:08,185 --> 01:12:10,225
''...to show that they were still alive.

929
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:13,905
''The pit was at least two-thirds full.

930
01:12:14,586 --> 01:12:19,386
''l estimated that it already contained
about one thousand humans.

931
01:12:19,826 --> 01:12:22,386
''The victims, completely naked...

932
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:26,707
''...went down some steps which were
cut out of the clay wall of the pit and...

933
01:12:27,067 --> 01:12:30,067
''...clambered over the heads
of the people lying there...

934
01:12:30,867 --> 01:12:34,907
''...to the place where the SS man
had directed them.

935
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:39,907
''They lay down in front
of the dead or injured.

936
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:44,027
''Some caressed those
who were still alive...

937
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:46,867
''...and spoke to them in low voices.

938
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:50,106
''Then l heard a series of shots.

939
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:54,547
''l looked back into the pit
and saw that the bodies were twitching.

940
01:12:55,987 --> 01:13:00,947
''The heads lying already motionless
were on top of the bodies that lay...

941
01:13:02,947 --> 01:13:04,306
''...beneath them.

942
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:09,987
''When l walked back, around the mound,
l noticed another truckload had arrived.

943
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:13,427
''This time it included the sick
and the infirm.

944
01:13:14,427 --> 01:13:18,108
''An old, very thin, very frail woman...

945
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:23,707
''...with terribly thin legs, was undressed
by the others who were already naked...

946
01:13:23,828 --> 01:13:25,548
''...while two people held her up.

947
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,628
''The woman was obviously paralyzed.

948
01:13:29,228 --> 01:13:30,868
''The naked people...

949
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,467
''...carried the old woman...

950
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:37,307
''...around the mound...

951
01:13:41,148 --> 01:13:45,028
''...and the shooting continued.''

952
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:54,307
Signed, Friedrich Graebe.

953
01:14:02,029 --> 01:14:05,029
Did any of you ever hear of this Graebe?

954
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:41,789
Rough day, Reichsmarschall?

955
01:14:41,988 --> 01:14:43,068
On the contrary.

956
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:46,109
We had an excellent lunch,
a nice view of the city.

957
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:49,750
And in the courtroom,
we had the best seats in the house.

958
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:51,269
Cuffs off!

959
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:55,909
They go on about this Graebe person.
lt doesn't concern us.

960
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,510
We were not even mentioned.

961
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,590
They must have
very little evidence against us.

962
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:04,829
l always suspected the British prosecutor
was a Jew. Now l am sure of it!

963
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:07,630
- Shut up, Streicher.
- Please, don't be so na.ive!

964
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:09,350
We are on trial!

965
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,829
Of course they'll say
terrible things about us.

966
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:15,510
- They have not even begun.
- Lock them up.

967
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:19,870
Happy dreams, Leutnant.

968
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,429
Good night, Reichsmarschall.

969
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:31,590
Your Honors, l would like to read
into the record Document 294-PS...

970
01:15:31,829 --> 01:15:35,949
...which describes manpower initiatives
and how they were directed.

971
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:41,911
You have already read into record eight
nearly identical documents on this subject.

972
01:15:42,591 --> 01:15:45,711
Do you really feel it's necessary
to introduce a ninth?

973
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,791
Yes, your honor, l do.

974
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:50,671
Very well. Please continue.

975
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:54,951
Document 294-PS begins as follows...

976
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:03,510
l have come to the conclusion the
sentences are already being carried out.

977
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:08,951
Justice Jackson means to bore us to death
and is succeeding beyond his hopes.

978
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:15,230
Now the Fuhrer, what a speaker!
At a rally, here in Nuremberg...

979
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:19,470
...he held an audience of 250,000 people
in the palm of his hand...

980
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:21,631
...for an entire afternoon.

981
01:16:22,551 --> 01:16:23,990
As legal strategy...

982
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,271
...your documentary approach
has been unassailable.

983
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:31,631
But as drama, it is,
l regret to say, absolutely stultifying.

984
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:36,351
As you know, it's not meant to be
entertainment. lt's meant to be a trial.

985
01:16:36,431 --> 01:16:40,431
- And it's ours to lose.
- A trial is a show, Robert.

986
01:16:41,032 --> 01:16:42,912
Like it or not, it's a show.

987
01:16:43,952 --> 01:16:46,752
And those four learned men
sitting on the bench...

988
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:49,311
...are as impressionable as any audience.

989
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:53,912
You're pushing for witnesses?

990
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:57,391
Witnesses will give this trial a human face.

991
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:01,592
One compelling witness can outweigh
a ton of documentary evidence.

992
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:12,711
Mr. Pachelogg,
while you were imprisoned in Dachau...

993
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:16,472
...were you at one time asked
to participate in a medical experiment?

994
01:17:16,912 --> 01:17:17,592
Yes.

995
01:17:17,672 --> 01:17:20,792
And the Nazi doctor who supervised
that experiment, Dr. Rascher...

996
01:17:20,872 --> 01:17:23,832
...did he ever explain to you its purpose?

997
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,592
He said the Luftwaffe had a problem.

998
01:17:26,672 --> 01:17:30,512
That its pilots shot down
over the North Sea...

999
01:17:30,632 --> 01:17:36,992
...often survived a crash in freezing waters
only to die later, after being rescued.

1000
01:17:38,273 --> 01:17:43,393
The purpose of the experiment
was to prevent these deaths.

1001
01:17:44,472 --> 01:17:46,952
And what experiment did he devise?

1002
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:55,233
First, l helped to strip
other male inmates naked...

1003
01:17:55,353 --> 01:17:57,113
...and put them into water tanks.

1004
01:17:57,193 --> 01:18:00,193
You were forced
to do this to fellow inmates?

1005
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:01,634
Yes.

1006
01:18:02,793 --> 01:18:03,833
And then?

1007
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:09,034
Then we added large pieces of ice.

1008
01:18:14,033 --> 01:18:19,594
We put thermometers into their rectums
to make sure the men were freezing.

1009
01:18:22,154 --> 01:18:24,634
Then, some of them we plunged
into hot water...

1010
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:30,153
...others in warm water, others we put
next to naked female inmates...

1011
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:35,434
...so the doctor could learn
which method would best revive them.

1012
01:18:38,913 --> 01:18:41,634
Mr. Pachelogg, would you be so kind...

1013
01:18:42,394 --> 01:18:45,954
...as to read this conclusion...

1014
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,713
...from Dr. Rascher's meticulous records.

1015
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:01,475
''Rapid rewarming was, in all cases,
preferable to slow rewarming...

1016
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:04,475
''...because after removal
from the cold water...

1017
01:19:04,715 --> 01:19:08,034
''...the body temperature
continued to drop rapidly.

1018
01:19:08,435 --> 01:19:11,995
''Rewarming by animal warmth
was too slow.''

1019
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:16,315
Thank you.

1020
01:19:17,835 --> 01:19:22,034
Mr. Pachelogg, do you recall
whatever became of the subjects of...

1021
01:19:22,274 --> 01:19:25,034
...Dr. Rascher's experiments on behalf of...

1022
01:19:26,154 --> 01:19:27,474
...the Luftwaffe?

1023
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:36,235
Most of them went into convulsions
and died.

1024
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:42,515
Thank you.

1025
01:19:45,996 --> 01:19:52,195
ln 1942, l was arrested, interrogated
and ordered to sign a false confession.

1026
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,315
l refused.

1027
01:19:54,996 --> 01:19:56,876
The German officer threatened me.

1028
01:19:57,315 --> 01:20:00,795
l told him, ''l am not afraid of being shot.''

1029
01:20:02,315 --> 01:20:07,235
He said, ''We have means at our disposal
which are far worse than being shot.''

1030
01:20:10,716 --> 01:20:12,316
Please continue, Madame.

1031
01:20:14,275 --> 01:20:19,235
Soon afterwards, l found myself packed
with 230 other French women...

1032
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:22,115
...in a sealed train
on our way to Auschwitz.

1033
01:20:22,195 --> 01:20:23,235
A sealed train?

1034
01:20:23,595 --> 01:20:26,035
No food, no water. Nothing.

1035
01:20:27,796 --> 01:20:31,836
At Auschwitz, the trains ran almost
all the way to the gas chamber.

1036
01:20:33,636 --> 01:20:35,277
They unsealed the cars...

1037
01:20:35,756 --> 01:20:37,916
...and the soldiers let everyone out.

1038
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:45,757
l saw men, women, children, old couples...

1039
01:20:46,476 --> 01:20:48,317
...forced to part from each other.

1040
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:52,076
Mothers made to abandon their children.

1041
01:20:55,077 --> 01:20:57,476
None were aware of the fate
that awaited them.

1042
01:20:58,636 --> 01:21:00,796
Those selected for the gas chamber...

1043
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:03,677
...were immediately driven
to a red brick building.

1044
01:21:04,837 --> 01:21:08,437
l saw my friend, Annette, on that truck.

1045
01:21:09,436 --> 01:21:10,916
She called to me.

1046
01:21:12,237 --> 01:21:15,957
''Think of my little boy
if you ever get back to France.''

1047
01:21:18,518 --> 01:21:21,597
Then she put her arms
around another French woman...

1048
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:24,718
...and they began singing La Marseillaise.

1049
01:21:26,518 --> 01:21:30,238
One night, we were awakened
by horrible cries.

1050
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:35,398
The next day we learned
that the Nazis had run out of gas...

1051
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,797
...and the children had been
thrown into the furnaces alive.

1052
01:21:42,198 --> 01:21:45,597
Of the 230 women on that train...

1053
01:21:46,637 --> 01:21:49,318
...how many returned from Auschwitz?

1054
01:21:49,877 --> 01:21:51,197
Forty-nine.

1055
01:21:52,997 --> 01:21:54,357
Thank you, Madame.

1056
01:21:54,797 --> 01:21:56,037
You're excused.

1057
01:22:33,038 --> 01:22:34,238
There you are.

1058
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:38,958
The film came in late last night,
and l was up until dawn watching it.

1059
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:41,559
Very few people have seen this film.

1060
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:44,599
You have got to enter this
into evidence this morning.

1061
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,238
What's the film?

1062
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:50,079
You're not going to believe this.

1063
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,560
May it please the tribunal.

1064
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,400
The United States now offers
a film into evidence.

1065
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:03,560
lt was compiled from motion pictures
taken by Allied military photographers...

1066
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:08,039
...as their armies liberated areas in which
concentration camps were located.

1067
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,480
Go.

1068
01:28:21,868 --> 01:28:26,205
lt was such a nice day, laughing, joking...

1069
01:28:28,332 --> 01:28:30,960
...and then they showed that horrid film.

1070
01:28:32,543 --> 01:28:35,546
Propaganda. Anyone can do it.

1071
01:28:35,713 --> 01:28:39,634
A little of this, a little of that,
and before you know it...

1072
01:28:42,805 --> 01:28:44,056
Still...

1073
01:28:46,515 --> 01:28:48,018
Those films...

1074
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,772
l've read any number of affidavits,
reports, statistics.

1075
01:28:54,106 --> 01:28:57,109
But l didn't really understand
until l saw those films.

1076
01:29:00,945 --> 01:29:02,363
l still don't understand.

1077
01:29:03,448 --> 01:29:05,116
l don't think l ever will.

1078
01:29:07,202 --> 01:29:11,623
How could civilized human beings
do that to other civilized human beings?

1079
01:29:16,252 --> 01:29:18,255
Maybe civilization's overrated.

1080
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:26,011
Good night, Leutnant.

1081
01:29:26,095 --> 01:29:27,722
Goodnight, Reichsmarschall.

1082
01:31:08,899 --> 01:31:12,569
Dr. Speer, help me understand
what l witnessed today in the dining room.

1083
01:31:13,613 --> 01:31:17,240
Goring's ability to dominate
and intimidate without possessing...

1084
01:31:17,323 --> 01:31:18,826
...a real shred of power.

1085
01:31:18,826 --> 01:31:19,409
 

1086
01:31:19,409 --> 01:31:20,786
How do you explain that?

1087
01:31:22,537 --> 01:31:24,747
Habit. lnstinct.

1088
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:29,168
Something in the German character
that responds to authority...

1089
01:31:29,711 --> 01:31:31,212
...real or imagined.

1090
01:31:31,295 --> 01:31:32,712
- That's all it is?
- Yeah.

1091
01:31:32,963 --> 01:31:36,591
What about the ideas he expressed?
The words, thoughts, they had no impact?

1092
01:31:37,176 --> 01:31:39,304
What ideas? What thoughts?

1093
01:31:40,012 --> 01:31:41,680
There were only platitudes.

1094
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:44,432
Nazi Germany was built
on empty platitudes.

1095
01:31:46,435 --> 01:31:50,397
A man like you,
you were seduced by empty platitudes?

1096
01:31:52,524 --> 01:31:53,608
Of course.

1097
01:31:53,734 --> 01:31:56,528
Because you can hear in them
any meaning you want.

1098
01:31:59,905 --> 01:32:02,324
You said earlier
you wanted to tell me something.

1099
01:32:06,703 --> 01:32:10,164
l've been trying to encourage
some of the other defendants...

1100
01:32:11,332 --> 01:32:14,627
...to join with me in accepting guilt
and expressing remorse.

1101
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:18,048
l made progress with Frank,
and l have had high hopes...

1102
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:19,590
...for young von Schirach.

1103
01:32:19,716 --> 01:32:22,594
But Goring means to bully them
into joining him.

1104
01:32:22,677 --> 01:32:24,930
And l fear now, he will succeed.

1105
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,140
Unless someone stops him.

1106
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,184
l understand.

1107
01:32:35,855 --> 01:32:37,023
All rise.

1108
01:32:59,087 --> 01:33:03,257
Herr Goring, do you believe that
the Nazi party came into power legally?

1109
01:33:03,841 --> 01:33:08,470
l do. And l am happy to explain in detail
the history of those first elections.

1110
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,848
But l will add that once we came to power,
we were determined to hold onto it...

1111
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:14,600
...under all circumstances.

1112
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:17,436
We did not want to leave this
any longer to chance...

1113
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,814
...to elections
and parliamentary majorities.

1114
01:33:20,064 --> 01:33:22,608
lt had always been our plan
once we came to power...

1115
01:33:22,733 --> 01:33:24,860
...that we would eliminate the Reichstag...

1116
01:33:24,984 --> 01:33:28,072
...dissolve the regional parliaments,
end individual rights.

1117
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:32,242
Where did the idea come from
to combine the ceremonial head of state...

1118
01:33:36,704 --> 01:33:40,833
That's quite simple. We took our example
from the similar dual roles...

1119
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:43,043
...of the President of the United States.

1120
01:33:46,547 --> 01:33:48,465
And the idea for concentration camps?

1121
01:33:48,591 --> 01:33:49,884
The idea was mine.

1122
01:33:53,845 --> 01:33:55,805
lt was a question of removing danger.

1123
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,766
Only one course was available.

1124
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:00,268
Protective custody.

1125
01:34:00,685 --> 01:34:03,563
How could the party rule
until it had established order?

1126
01:34:03,898 --> 01:34:06,900
And how could it maintain order
with its deadly enemies...

1127
01:34:06,984 --> 01:34:09,486
...particularly the Communists,
running free?

1128
01:34:14,658 --> 01:34:15,909
No further questions.

1129
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,884
l don't get it. He's tightening the noose
around his own neck.

1130
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:37,177
He doesn't care. He has bigger fish to fry.

1131
01:34:37,261 --> 01:34:40,766
He's talking over the heads of the tribunal
directly to the German people.

1132
01:34:40,849 --> 01:34:44,936
l suggest you isolate him from the others
when they're not in the courtroom.

1133
01:34:53,444 --> 01:34:55,696
l don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

1134
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:56,947
lnside.

1135
01:35:03,662 --> 01:35:05,747
Me? l'm just following orders.

1136
01:35:23,389 --> 01:35:24,431
During cross...

1137
01:35:24,515 --> 01:35:27,810
...hit Goring quick and hard.
Put him on the defensive right away.

1138
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,353
Never let him breathe.

1139
01:35:29,853 --> 01:35:33,148
l see no point in that at all.
He's blatantly incriminating himself.

1140
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:36,817
All l need to do is ask direct questions
and let him answer them.

1141
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:39,862
Be prepared with a tough line
of questioning.

1142
01:35:40,195 --> 01:35:41,404
ln case it's needed.

1143
01:35:43,364 --> 01:35:44,824
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1144
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:50,997
Why am l being punished like a schoolboy?

1145
01:35:51,957 --> 01:35:52,750
Speer?

1146
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:54,542
Speer's behind this.

1147
01:35:54,752 --> 01:35:58,505
He must have talked to Colonel Andrus,
persuaded him into this line of action.

1148
01:35:58,546 --> 01:36:00,339
How do you know it wasn't me?

1149
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:04,676
Why Dr. Speer? ls there rivalry
between the two of you?

1150
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:07,430
He is ashamed of being a Nazi. l'm not.

1151
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:09,974
He wishes to infect the others
with his shame.

1152
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,434
You have no shame?

1153
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:15,813
The world has now seen proof of
the horrors committed by Nazi Germany.

1154
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,855
You are comfortable defending every bit of it?

1155
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:21,025
l've seen so many horrors already.
The carnage of the First War...

1156
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:24,404
...thousands of my countrymen maimed,
degraded, starved.

1157
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,324
No, my dear doctor.

1158
01:36:27,783 --> 01:36:31,036
l am not an inhuman monster
who has no regard for human life.

1159
01:36:31,328 --> 01:36:34,080
These atrocities are not indifferent to me.

1160
01:36:35,914 --> 01:36:39,252
You know, we are accused
of so many appalling acts...

1161
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,961
...it is hard to keep track.

1162
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:43,756
- Did you try?
- My concern was war.

1163
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:46,884
And in war, each nation has
its own selfish interest.

1164
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:49,051
You have to be practical.

1165
01:36:49,552 --> 01:36:52,846
l am a practical man. And l'm a soldier.

1166
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:55,600
And a soldier's code is obedience.

1167
01:36:57,268 --> 01:36:58,269
Obedience.

1168
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:59,853
This amuses you?

1169
01:37:00,311 --> 01:37:02,564
Blind obedience without responsibility.

1170
01:37:02,649 --> 01:37:04,442
ls there nobody in this country...

1171
01:37:04,567 --> 01:37:08,488
...that will take responsibility for anything?
Nobody who can say no?

1172
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:11,782
Take a look at every cell in this block.
What do you see?

1173
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,074
Yes men.

1174
01:37:13,783 --> 01:37:15,868
All the no men are six feet underground.

1175
01:37:19,413 --> 01:37:20,581
What is this?

1176
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:24,918
You're not Jewish, are you?

1177
01:37:29,881 --> 01:37:31,716
Yes. l am.

1178
01:37:37,805 --> 01:37:39,057
l see.

1179
01:37:42,478 --> 01:37:44,771
This is a very interesting situation.

1180
01:37:45,689 --> 01:37:46,981
For both of us.

1181
01:38:02,037 --> 01:38:03,454
Good luck, old boy.

1182
01:38:06,832 --> 01:38:08,250
So, what's his plan?

1183
01:38:08,918 --> 01:38:10,336
l haven't a clue.

1184
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,800
Will the witness repeat this oath after me?

1185
01:38:20,779 --> 01:38:23,239
''l swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient...''

1186
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,434
l swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient...

1187
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,937
''...that l will speak the pure truth...

1188
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:31,067
''...and will withhold and add nothing.''

1189
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:34,992
That l will speak the pure truth
and will withhold and add nothing.

1190
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:38,735
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?

1191
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:57,167
You are perhaps aware
that you are the only living man...

1192
01:38:57,779 --> 01:38:59,364
...who can expound to us...

1193
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,731
...the true purposes of the Nazi Party
and the inner workings of its leadership.

1194
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:05,724
l am perfectly aware of that.

1195
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,426
You, from the very beginning...

1196
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:10,732
...together with those
who you were associated with...

1197
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,810
...intended to overthrow,
and later on did overthrow...

1198
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:17,210
...Germany's previous government,
the Weimar Republic?

1199
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:19,047
That was my firm intention.

1200
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:23,372
And upon coming to power
you immediately abolished parliamentary...

1201
01:39:24,405 --> 01:39:26,283
...democratic government in Germany.

1202
01:39:26,908 --> 01:39:28,868
We found it no longer to be necessary.

1203
01:39:29,244 --> 01:39:32,038
ls it not true that people
were subsequently thrown...

1204
01:39:32,081 --> 01:39:35,292
...into concentration camps
without recourse from the courts?

1205
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:37,918
You must distinguish
between two categories.

1206
01:39:38,502 --> 01:39:41,463
Those who had committed a treason
against the new state...

1207
01:39:41,672 --> 01:39:43,298
...were naturally turned over to the courts.

1208
01:39:43,382 --> 01:39:45,592
Others, of whom one might expect
such acts...

1209
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:47,428
...but who had not yet committed them...

1210
01:39:47,511 --> 01:39:49,972
...such as functionaries
of the Communist Party...

1211
01:39:50,055 --> 01:39:51,432
...who were attacking us--

1212
01:39:51,515 --> 01:39:52,932
You answered the question.

1213
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,601
l need to explain further.

1214
01:39:54,643 --> 01:39:56,770
You'll have the opportunity to explain...

1215
01:39:56,853 --> 01:39:59,105
...under re-examination
from your own counsel.

1216
01:40:00,606 --> 01:40:04,735
Did you prohibit all court review
of the cause for taking people...

1217
01:40:04,819 --> 01:40:07,404
...into what you were calling
''protective custody''?

1218
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:10,741
That l answered very clearly,
but l'd like to make an explanation...

1219
01:40:10,783 --> 01:40:12,034
...about my answer.

1220
01:40:12,118 --> 01:40:14,579
Your counsel will see to that.
About the camps--

1221
01:40:14,662 --> 01:40:16,163
Mr. Justice Jackson.

1222
01:40:16,247 --> 01:40:19,083
The Tribunal thinks
the witness must be allowed to make...

1223
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:22,211
...what explanation he thinks right
in answer to this question.

1224
01:40:28,966 --> 01:40:31,469
The Tribunal thinks
that you should be permitted...

1225
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:33,386
...to explain your answer now...

1226
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:36,014
...and it will listen to that explanation.

1227
01:40:39,685 --> 01:40:41,728
l want to say that l issued a decree...

1228
01:40:41,813 --> 01:40:44,856
...that those who were turned over
to the concentration camps...

1229
01:40:45,149 --> 01:40:48,819
...should be informed
after 24 hours of the reason...

1230
01:40:49,485 --> 01:40:51,654
...and allowed an attorney after 48 hours.

1231
01:40:51,738 --> 01:40:55,200
This by no means rescinded my order
that a court review...

1232
01:40:55,283 --> 01:40:57,327
...of these measures was not permitted.

1233
01:40:57,409 --> 01:40:59,244
By ''protective custody'' you mean...

1234
01:40:59,328 --> 01:41:02,414
...taking people in custody
who had not yet committed a crime...

1235
01:41:02,497 --> 01:41:04,958
...but you believed might commit
a crime in the future?

1236
01:41:05,042 --> 01:41:08,796
Yes, just as extensive protective measures
are being taken in Germany today--

1237
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:11,298
l didn't ask you about Germany today.

1238
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:12,673
Mr. Justice Jackson.

1239
01:41:12,882 --> 01:41:14,510
This is poor preparation.

1240
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:19,806
The witness may finish his explanation.

1241
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:37,530
You say that you were against
the attack on Soviet Russia.

1242
01:41:37,864 --> 01:41:40,742
Yet you gave no warning
to the German people.

1243
01:41:41,284 --> 01:41:43,537
You brought no pressure to bear
to prevent it.

1244
01:41:43,828 --> 01:41:46,456
You did not even resign
to protect your place in history.

1245
01:41:46,538 --> 01:41:50,001
We were at war, and such differences
of opinion could not be brought...

1246
01:41:50,085 --> 01:41:52,128
...before the public during war.

1247
01:41:52,212 --> 01:41:54,006
This was the case in your own country.

1248
01:41:54,088 --> 01:41:55,841
- Your second question--
- That'll suffice.

1249
01:41:55,923 --> 01:41:57,591
l'm not finished. Secondly...

1250
01:41:57,676 --> 01:41:58,551
Your Honor, please.

1251
01:41:58,635 --> 01:42:01,137
The witness must be allowed
to have his say.

1252
01:42:02,345 --> 01:42:04,306
As far as my resignation...

1253
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:06,684
...l do not wish even to discuss that...

1254
01:42:06,975 --> 01:42:09,268
...for l was an officer, a soldier.

1255
01:42:09,685 --> 01:42:11,103
l served my country.

1256
01:42:11,188 --> 01:42:12,189
- l ask you--
- Thirdly--

1257
01:42:12,271 --> 01:42:13,273
Your Honor, please!

1258
01:42:13,355 --> 01:42:14,190
Thirdly...

1259
01:42:14,231 --> 01:42:16,775
...l was not the man to forsake someone...

1260
01:42:16,859 --> 01:42:19,069
...to whom l had given my oath of loyalty...

1261
01:42:19,153 --> 01:42:21,405
...every time he was not
to my way of thinking.

1262
01:42:21,488 --> 01:42:22,197
Your Honor--

1263
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:25,493
lt never, ever occurred to me
to leave the Fuhrer.

1264
01:42:27,703 --> 01:42:30,163
The witness is adopting
a contemptuous attitude...

1265
01:42:30,247 --> 01:42:31,289
...toward this Tribunal...

1266
01:42:31,373 --> 01:42:34,626
...which is giving him trial
that he never gave a living soul...

1267
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:36,086
...nor dead ones either!

1268
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:37,880
Objection, Your Honor.

1269
01:42:43,844 --> 01:42:45,595
l'm ready for the next question.

1270
01:42:56,771 --> 01:42:59,858
l think this is probably a good point
to adjourn for the day.

1271
01:43:25,506 --> 01:43:27,091
Tough calls from the bench.

1272
01:43:27,717 --> 01:43:29,344
Well, it's only Round One.

1273
01:43:30,386 --> 01:43:33,139
lf you think you need anything,
don't forget, l'm here.

1274
01:43:58,913 --> 01:44:02,041
As the week ends, there's a consensus
among all present...

1275
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:05,627
...that Hermann Goring now appears to be
in control of the court.

1276
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:09,923
Will Jackson? Will anyone
be able to stop him?

1277
01:44:14,011 --> 01:44:15,012
Yes, Bob?

1278
01:44:18,265 --> 01:44:21,643
You know, Judge, l didn't leave
the Supreme Court to come here...

1279
01:44:21,726 --> 01:44:23,979
...and be thwarted by a fellow countrymen.

1280
01:44:24,604 --> 01:44:27,398
That sounds like sour grapes.
Very unbecoming.

1281
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:31,735
To an outsider, it might appear like
you were trying to sabotage me.

1282
01:44:32,612 --> 01:44:36,532
You gave Goring an open forum
during direct examination.

1283
01:44:36,615 --> 01:44:38,826
l must be able to control him during cross.

1284
01:44:40,368 --> 01:44:43,581
Just accept the fact that you weren't
at the top of your game today.

1285
01:44:44,414 --> 01:44:46,875
You have the weekend
to prepare for the next round.

1286
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:48,836
Make good use of it.

1287
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:23,617
- Not hungry, sir?
- l'm too excited to eat.

1288
01:45:26,121 --> 01:45:27,663
Did you hear what l said?

1289
01:45:27,914 --> 01:45:30,500
My reply when he asked me
why l did not resign?

1290
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:32,668
l lectured him about loyalty!

1291
01:45:32,752 --> 01:45:34,879
You should have seen Jackson's face.

1292
01:45:35,587 --> 01:45:38,090
lt was a completely foreign concept to him.

1293
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:41,051
lf l didn't know better,
l would say Jackson was a Jew.

1294
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:43,511
No. Keep it.

1295
01:45:45,221 --> 01:45:47,390
My initials, see? Engraved.

1296
01:45:48,516 --> 01:45:49,768
lt's real nice.

1297
01:45:51,394 --> 01:45:52,436
l'll never forget this.

1298
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,147
l know, Leutnant. l know.

1299
01:45:55,023 --> 01:45:56,231
Sit down.

1300
01:45:57,524 --> 01:46:00,862
You know, my friends call me Tex.

1301
01:46:02,113 --> 01:46:03,740
All right, Tex.

1302
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:06,701
Let me tell you something, Tex.

1303
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:10,078
America will soon learn that
they are backing the wrong philosophy.

1304
01:46:10,162 --> 01:46:13,039
We should both be together
fighting the forces of Communism.

1305
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:15,042
- You think?
- Yeah.

1306
01:46:15,876 --> 01:46:16,960
You think?

1307
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:18,337
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1308
01:46:19,003 --> 01:46:21,046
- l think we both agree, no?
- Yeah.

1309
01:46:26,844 --> 01:46:28,721
l'd like to dictate a telegram.

1310
01:46:38,648 --> 01:46:40,524
President Truman, the White House.

1311
01:46:40,608 --> 01:46:44,570
''Please accept my resignation as
Chief Prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials...

1312
01:46:44,987 --> 01:46:47,864
''...and appoint a replacement
at the earliest possible-- ''

1313
01:46:48,407 --> 01:46:50,951
l'm not writing this. l won't.

1314
01:46:54,287 --> 01:46:57,289
You saw today that l'm not up to this task.

1315
01:46:57,622 --> 01:47:01,793
l could stay, out of pride,
and unravel everything...

1316
01:47:01,877 --> 01:47:05,088
...we've all worked so hard for.
Or l can step aside--

1317
01:47:05,171 --> 01:47:06,797
Bob, you are this trial.

1318
01:47:07,131 --> 01:47:10,551
Everything it is, everything it represents,
is from inside you.

1319
01:47:10,635 --> 01:47:12,471
Your thoughts, your values.

1320
01:47:12,555 --> 01:47:14,431
l tasted failure today...

1321
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:17,975
...and realized what it would mean.
Not only to myself...

1322
01:47:18,018 --> 01:47:20,060
...but to everyone connected with this.

1323
01:47:20,145 --> 01:47:22,522
The only way they can triumph over you...

1324
01:47:22,604 --> 01:47:24,898
...is if their values are stronger than yours.

1325
01:47:25,065 --> 01:47:28,360
lf they believe in their ideals
more than you believe in yours.

1326
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:31,238
ls that true, Bob?

1327
01:47:33,032 --> 01:47:35,576
Does Hermann Goring
actually believe in his ideals...

1328
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:37,743
...more than you believe in yours?

1329
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:12,359
You're right.

1330
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:15,655
And thank you.

1331
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,708
You're welcome.

1332
01:48:59,112 --> 01:49:02,658
Now, look here. What happened
wasn't entirely your fault.

1333
01:49:03,826 --> 01:49:06,828
God knows, l'd be hard-pressed
to defeat a clever defendant...

1334
01:49:06,912 --> 01:49:10,373
...who's allowed to say whatever he wants
for as long as he wants.

1335
01:49:10,998 --> 01:49:14,251
Now that you've finished
with the niceties, let's have the truth.

1336
01:49:15,252 --> 01:49:18,255
Well, it was very damaging, Robert.

1337
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,967
You've introduced this trial
from a position of moral superiority.

1338
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:25,846
And as a result,
you've become its chief symbol.

1339
01:49:26,637 --> 01:49:28,180
lf you can't maintain that...

1340
01:49:28,264 --> 01:49:31,476
...or if the balance shifts ever so slightly
it could be a disaster.

1341
01:49:32,393 --> 01:49:34,478
Hermann Goring is using this trial...

1342
01:49:34,686 --> 01:49:38,315
...to present himself as a
philosopher-statesman on Hitler's level.

1343
01:49:39,024 --> 01:49:40,818
Do you see Goring as a statesman?

1344
01:49:41,152 --> 01:49:44,697
No, l do not. l see him as reprehensible.

1345
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:46,698
As inhuman.

1346
01:49:46,782 --> 01:49:48,117
Then treat him as such.

1347
01:49:48,367 --> 01:49:50,452
Treat him as the vile, conniving...

1348
01:49:50,536 --> 01:49:52,871
...bloody fascist bastard that he is.

1349
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:06,300
Where the hell is he?

1350
01:50:06,384 --> 01:50:07,592
He'll be here.

1351
01:50:34,034 --> 01:50:36,662
Mr. Chief Prosecutor, if you are ready.

1352
01:50:37,579 --> 01:50:40,873
From the very beginning,
you regarded the elimination of the Jews...

1353
01:50:40,957 --> 01:50:44,877
...from the economic life of Germany
as under your jurisdiction, did you not?

1354
01:50:45,212 --> 01:50:48,924
Yeah. The elimination from economic life,
that is partly correct.

1355
01:50:49,632 --> 01:50:53,636
Large industries, also armament industries
under Jewish directors.

1356
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:56,847
Was that the first of your legal measures
against the Jews?

1357
01:50:56,931 --> 01:50:59,475
l believe removal from office was first,
in 1933.

1358
01:50:59,725 --> 01:51:03,563
Then, in 1936,
you personally drafted an act...

1359
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:07,483
...making it punishable by death
to transfer property abroad?

1360
01:51:07,608 --> 01:51:08,692
That is correct.

1361
01:51:08,775 --> 01:51:12,487
And another that all damage caused
to Jewish property...

1362
01:51:13,029 --> 01:51:15,489
...by the anti-Jewish riots of 1938...

1363
01:51:15,614 --> 01:51:18,117
...must be repaired by Jews
at their own expense...

1364
01:51:18,701 --> 01:51:21,746
...with their insurance claims
forfeited to the Reich.

1365
01:51:22,246 --> 01:51:25,375
l did sign a similar law.
Whether it was exactly the same, l...

1366
01:51:25,917 --> 01:51:28,378
And did you not say about those riots...

1367
01:51:29,587 --> 01:51:31,381
l show you this transcript.

1368
01:51:32,965 --> 01:51:36,510
Did you not say,
''l wish you had killed 200 Jews...

1369
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,887
''...instead of destroying such valuables''?

1370
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:42,391
That was said in a moment of bad temper
and extreme excitement.

1371
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:45,059
Spontaneous sincerity, in other words.

1372
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:49,646
Did you not also personally sign a decree
in September, 1940...

1373
01:51:49,814 --> 01:51:52,400
...ordering seizure
of all Jewish property in Poland?

1374
01:51:52,608 --> 01:51:54,402
l assume so, if the decree is there.

1375
01:51:54,443 --> 01:51:57,613
And another, which provided
that Jews receive no compensation...

1376
01:51:57,695 --> 01:52:01,783
...for damages caused by enemy attacks
or by German forces?

1377
01:52:01,868 --> 01:52:04,078
lf the law bears my name,
then it must be so.

1378
01:52:07,288 --> 01:52:08,623
ls this your signature?

1379
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:11,501
lt appears to be.

1380
01:52:11,585 --> 01:52:14,378
ls it, or is it not, your signature?

1381
01:52:21,844 --> 01:52:22,595
lt is.

1382
01:52:24,137 --> 01:52:25,764
Your signature...

1383
01:52:26,306 --> 01:52:30,519
...on a decree dated July, 1941
asking Himmler...

1384
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:33,771
...and Heydrich and the SS to make plans...

1385
01:52:34,021 --> 01:52:36,484
...for the ''final solution''
of the Jewish question.

1386
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,682
That is not a proper translation.

1387
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:41,720
l said ''total'' solution, not ''final'' solution.

1388
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,045
These are your words to Himmler:

1389
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:47,595
''l charge you to send me before long
an overall plan concerning...

1390
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,212
''...the organizational, factual
and material measures necessary...

1391
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:53,967
''...for the desired solution
of the Jewish question.''

1392
01:52:54,359 --> 01:52:58,197
ls that an accurate translation on what is written in this order
from you to Heydrich and Himmler?

1393
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:02,222
That had to do with emigration
and evacuation of the Jews.

1394
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:05,530
And you ordered all other government agencies
to cooperate with the SS...

1395
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,172
...in the final solution
of the Jewish question. Did you not?

1396
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:10,096
There's nothing in there about the SS.

1397
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:13,904
This document states you personally
ordered all government agencies...

1398
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:15,725
...to cooperate with the SS.

1399
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,502
You sent this letter
to SS Gruppenfuhrer Heydrich.

1400
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:21,815
That doesn't mean that the SS
had anything to do with the solution...

1401
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:23,707
...to the Jewish question.

1402
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,979
l must say this clearly.

1403
01:53:38,739 --> 01:53:41,034
l did not know anything that took place...

1404
01:53:41,659 --> 01:53:45,329
...or the methods that were used
in the concentration camps later.

1405
01:53:45,939 --> 01:53:48,192
These things were kept secret from me.

1406
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,716
And l might add...

1407
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,510
...that in my opinion...

1408
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:57,148
...even the Fuhrer did not know
the extent of what was happening.

1409
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:06,838
Witness, there is evidence
before this court...

1410
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,793
...that nearly 10 million people
have been exterminated.

1411
01:54:10,439 --> 01:54:11,939
Murdered in cold blood.

1412
01:54:12,199 --> 01:54:15,539
You mean to say that you did not,
and in your opinion, Hitler did not...

1413
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:18,222
...know what took place
in the concentration camps?

1414
01:54:20,439 --> 01:54:21,189
Ja

1415
01:54:31,966 --> 01:54:34,344
Do you know that Hitler said in 1943...

1416
01:54:35,011 --> 01:54:38,056
...in a recorded meeting,
l read you his words now.

1417
01:54:38,139 --> 01:54:41,182
Quote: ''The Reich's Minister
of Foreign Affairs...

1418
01:54:41,266 --> 01:54:44,060
''...declared that the Jews
should be exterminated...

1419
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:47,231
''...or taken to concentration camps.

1420
01:54:49,231 --> 01:54:51,109
''There is no other possibility.''

1421
01:54:52,152 --> 01:54:55,113
The Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Ribbentrop...

1422
01:54:55,779 --> 01:54:57,948
...talked with Hitler about extermination.

1423
01:54:58,032 --> 01:55:00,619
And you were above Ribbentrop.

1424
01:55:00,786 --> 01:55:02,746
You were Hitler's second-in-command.

1425
01:55:02,953 --> 01:55:05,622
You were in charge
of the economic Four Year Plan...

1426
01:55:05,707 --> 01:55:08,167
...so you knew all about
the gold wedding rings...

1427
01:55:08,251 --> 01:55:12,088
...the gold teeth and the gold eyeglasses
that the victims left behind.

1428
01:55:12,421 --> 01:55:15,466
And you have heard
that it took five extra minutes...

1429
01:55:15,591 --> 01:55:18,635
...to kill the women
because they had to cut their hair off...

1430
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,096
...to be used in making mattresses.

1431
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:24,598
And nothing was told to you...

1432
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:28,268
...about this material that came from
these people that had been murdered?

1433
01:55:28,519 --> 01:55:29,520
No!

1434
01:55:31,855 --> 01:55:32,523
No!

1435
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,485
How can you imagine such a thing?

1436
01:55:39,529 --> 01:55:43,283
l was laying down the broad outlines
of the German economy.

1437
01:55:46,787 --> 01:55:48,954
- The witness is excused.
- l'm not finished!

1438
01:55:48,997 --> 01:55:51,249
- The witness is excused.
- l am not finished!

1439
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,917
The witness is excused.

1440
01:56:31,537 --> 01:56:33,414
You know what would've been
a great touch?

1441
01:56:33,497 --> 01:56:35,916
Hermann Goring showing up
in a Santa outfit.

1442
01:56:36,957 --> 01:56:38,417
He'd probably do it.

1443
01:56:38,502 --> 01:56:41,337
After all, he was the Third Reich's
chief bon vivant.

1444
01:56:41,421 --> 01:56:44,507
Did you ever see pictures of him
at Hitler's mountain retreat...

1445
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:48,177
...dressed like a Tyrollean chorus boy
out of some grotesque operetta?

1446
01:57:00,523 --> 01:57:01,398
Excuse me.

1447
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:07,445
Leaving so soon?

1448
01:57:07,904 --> 01:57:10,407
Some of the defendants asked me
to come by tonight.

1449
01:57:10,489 --> 01:57:12,824
A little Christmas Eve chat with their rabbi.

1450
01:57:15,912 --> 01:57:19,498
You know the trial is about to enter
a new phase, a very important one.

1451
01:57:19,582 --> 01:57:23,878
The defendants will have to choose
between stonewalling and evading...

1452
01:57:23,962 --> 01:57:26,297
...or taking responsibility for their actions.

1453
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:31,844
Now, you are the best chance we have
to influence that choice.

1454
01:57:50,944 --> 01:57:51,903
Frau Hassel?

1455
01:57:52,904 --> 01:57:54,113
ls something wrong?

1456
01:57:54,448 --> 01:57:56,867
Do not ask me to serve the Russians.
Please.

1457
01:57:57,283 --> 01:57:58,451
They're our guests.

1458
01:57:59,537 --> 01:58:01,664
My son was killed on the Russian front.

1459
01:58:03,623 --> 01:58:06,083
Okay. l'll take care of this.
Go to the kitchen.

1460
01:58:11,296 --> 01:58:13,548
Try these little sausage things, General.

1461
01:58:13,632 --> 01:58:17,010
l forget what Frau Hassel calls them,
but l hear they're mighty tasty.

1462
01:58:18,261 --> 01:58:19,220
Madame.

1463
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:23,016
20 million of my people
were killed by the Germans.

1464
01:58:24,475 --> 01:58:27,311
Do you think l could be offended
by the snub of a Hausfrau?

1465
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:30,105
l don't know what to think, General.

1466
01:58:30,189 --> 01:58:33,150
Frankly, l can't keep track
of all the politics in this room.

1467
01:58:47,081 --> 01:58:49,708
The Russians sure don't disappear
in a crowd, do they?

1468
01:58:49,832 --> 01:58:51,999
Politics.

1469
01:58:51,835 --> 01:58:55,087
They've suffered more in this war
than any other country.

1470
01:58:55,713 --> 01:58:59,050
Must be doubly painful
to attract such little sympathy for them.

1471
01:59:07,015 --> 01:59:10,144
And Jackson decreed no wives
could come along.

1472
01:59:13,773 --> 01:59:16,234
Worked out quite nicely for him,
wouldn't you say?

1473
02:00:02,902 --> 02:00:04,194
Merry Christmas.

1474
02:01:08,505 --> 02:01:10,382
This was a very nice gesture.

1475
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:16,471
l figured it's probably their last Christmas.

1476
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,063
Merry Christmas, Colonel.

1477
02:01:39,368 --> 02:01:41,245
- Field Marshal.
- Doctor.

1478
02:01:41,494 --> 02:01:42,537
How are you?

1479
02:01:42,996 --> 02:01:44,748
l'm so glad that you are here.

1480
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:49,252
Please, sit. You are the only one
l can really talk to.

1481
02:01:50,168 --> 02:01:53,713
But you don't talk to me, Field Marshal.
Not really.

1482
02:01:54,631 --> 02:01:57,134
- l tell you everything about my family.
- Yes.

1483
02:01:57,426 --> 02:01:58,844
But not about you.

1484
02:02:00,511 --> 02:02:03,139
l would like to understand
how a man like you...

1485
02:02:03,222 --> 02:02:04,849
...a man of your background...

1486
02:02:04,932 --> 02:02:08,310
...could have drafted an instrument
like the Commando Order.

1487
02:02:08,895 --> 02:02:11,939
Allied soldiers found
behind enemy lines were shot...

1488
02:02:12,274 --> 02:02:13,650
...rather than captured?

1489
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:16,736
Or the Night and Fog Decree:
suspected Resistance members...

1490
02:02:16,819 --> 02:02:20,072
...were arrested in the middle of the night
and secretly murdered.

1491
02:02:22,658 --> 02:02:23,951
Because of you.

1492
02:02:27,662 --> 02:02:30,581
l know. l am dying of shame.

1493
02:02:34,127 --> 02:02:37,463
Don't you think it's time you admitted that
to the rest of the world?

1494
02:03:05,698 --> 02:03:08,368
l'm not in the mood, all right.

1495
02:03:09,077 --> 02:03:10,161
Get off of me.

1496
02:03:10,243 --> 02:03:11,202
Get off!

1497
02:03:29,179 --> 02:03:32,390
You were signing orders
that broke international laws and treaties.

1498
02:03:32,431 --> 02:03:34,559
How could you not question
what you were doing?

1499
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:38,563
Does a lieutenant say to his captain,
''Just a minute, sir, l have to consult...

1500
02:03:38,604 --> 02:03:42,483
''...the Hague Convention to see
if l am allowed to carry out your orders?''

1501
02:03:43,149 --> 02:03:45,610
lf we had disobeyed,
we would have been arrested.

1502
02:03:45,694 --> 02:03:46,612
Rightly so.

1503
02:03:46,694 --> 02:03:49,697
You realize without the support
of his generals, Herr Jodl...

1504
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:51,658
...Hitler could not have waged war.

1505
02:03:51,949 --> 02:03:55,537
lt is a soldier's duty is to obey orders.

1506
02:03:56,371 --> 02:03:58,873
That is a code l have lived by all my life.

1507
02:03:58,957 --> 02:04:01,835
And that code extends to the people
who ran the death camps?

1508
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,242
l'm sorry, sir.

1509
02:04:37,076 --> 02:04:40,246
Tex, my friend. Come in.

1510
02:04:41,538 --> 02:04:43,248
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1511
02:04:43,332 --> 02:04:44,625
lt's good to see you.

1512
02:04:46,335 --> 02:04:50,255
l know that Christmastime can be
a lonely thing away from home.

1513
02:04:51,797 --> 02:04:53,550
Merry Christmas, Reichsmarschall.

1514
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:56,635
My dear Tex, what luxury.

1515
02:05:00,597 --> 02:05:01,347
Prost.

1516
02:05:05,018 --> 02:05:06,353
- Cognac.
- Yeah.

1517
02:05:08,523 --> 02:05:11,817
So what would you be doing now
back in Texas?

1518
02:05:13,194 --> 02:05:16,613
On Christmas morning, we'd open
our presents and then go to church.

1519
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,658
Then, we'd head over
to Grandma and Grandpa's...

1520
02:05:19,698 --> 02:05:21,617
...for a big roast turkey dinner.

1521
02:05:22,077 --> 02:05:24,244
After that, Dad, Grandpa and me...

1522
02:05:24,912 --> 02:05:27,330
...we'd go out back
hunting for pheasant, quail.

1523
02:05:28,207 --> 02:05:30,334
Hunting! Hunting was my passion!

1524
02:05:31,167 --> 02:05:33,170
l was Germany's chief gamekeeper.

1525
02:05:33,252 --> 02:05:34,295
No kidding.

1526
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,298
The shooting around my estates
at Carinhall was wonderful.

1527
02:05:38,884 --> 02:05:40,719
Did Hitler ever go hunting with you?

1528
02:05:43,555 --> 02:05:47,476
l shouldn't tell you this,
but Hitler did not approve of hunting.

1529
02:05:48,143 --> 02:05:50,645
He felt that killing animals was immoral.

1530
02:05:51,729 --> 02:05:53,480
- He was a vegetarian.
- Yeah?

1531
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:55,399
Yes. He was a vegetarian.

1532
02:05:57,902 --> 02:06:01,947
Yeah, but that did not stop him from
being the most gracious host in Europe.

1533
02:06:03,614 --> 02:06:07,411
His dinner parties were legend.
Always the finest caviar and champagne.

1534
02:06:07,868 --> 02:06:10,788
Thought he did not partake,
he was not intolerant.

1535
02:06:11,247 --> 02:06:16,418
He would dazzle his guests
with every view under the sun until dawn.

1536
02:06:18,087 --> 02:06:22,384
l remember once we were celebrating
the triumph of Compiegne...

1537
02:06:23,051 --> 02:06:25,094
...where we savored the sweet revenge...

1538
02:06:25,177 --> 02:06:28,847
...of the French having surrendered
in the very same railway car...

1539
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:31,724
...that the Germans had capitulated in,
in 1918.

1540
02:06:31,766 --> 02:06:33,351
That must've been something.

1541
02:06:33,601 --> 02:06:36,145
lt was, believe me.

1542
02:06:37,564 --> 02:06:38,690
lt was.

1543
02:06:41,443 --> 02:06:45,905
You know...

1544
02:06:45,988 --> 02:06:48,740
...l have made my career
as a military man...

1545
02:06:50,283 --> 02:06:53,369
...and l have to say you remind me...

1546
02:06:54,412 --> 02:06:57,875
...of some of the finest young German
soldiers who served under me.

1547
02:07:01,795 --> 02:07:02,796
Thank you.

1548
02:07:04,465 --> 02:07:05,548
Merry Christmas.

1549
02:07:21,396 --> 02:07:22,648
Hello, America.

1550
02:07:23,398 --> 02:07:26,525
As Christmas descends
upon this sad and broken city...

1551
02:07:27,402 --> 02:07:30,238
...l'm here,
inside her great Palace of Justice.

1552
02:07:31,655 --> 02:07:35,911
And on this Christmas Eve, as we're filled
with thoughts of peace on Earth...

1553
02:07:36,828 --> 02:07:39,456
...it is here that the future of peace...

1554
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:41,791
...may well be determined.

1555
02:07:50,506 --> 02:07:53,594
Herr von Ribbentrop,
would you agree that as Foreign Minister...

1556
02:07:53,676 --> 02:07:56,470
...you forced Czechoslovakia
to surrender its territory...

1557
02:07:56,555 --> 02:07:58,847
...by the most intolerable threats
of aggression?

1558
02:07:58,931 --> 02:08:00,432
l do not agree.

1559
02:08:00,682 --> 02:08:02,644
You threatened to send your army in.

1560
02:08:03,019 --> 02:08:04,436
ln overwhelming strength.

1561
02:08:04,686 --> 02:08:06,479
And also bomb Prague.

1562
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:10,026
What further pressure could you
possibly have put upon them?

1563
02:08:10,609 --> 02:08:11,985
War, for instance.

1564
02:08:12,444 --> 02:08:13,237
War?

1565
02:08:15,864 --> 02:08:17,407
What is that but war?

1566
02:08:20,786 --> 02:08:23,913
Ribbentrop should be hanged
for his stupidity.

1567
02:08:24,747 --> 02:08:27,000
That is the greatest crime of all.

1568
02:08:33,005 --> 02:08:34,882
ln your newspaper, Herr Streicher...

1569
02:08:35,257 --> 02:08:39,219
...you wrote that the Jews are ''a nation
of bloodsuckers and extortionists.''

1570
02:08:40,011 --> 02:08:42,180
Do you think that's preaching race hatred?

1571
02:08:42,221 --> 02:08:45,016
No. l do not think it's preaching
race hatred.

1572
02:08:45,225 --> 02:08:47,603
lt is simply a statement of fact!

1573
02:08:51,731 --> 02:08:52,608
Dr. Funk...

1574
02:08:53,065 --> 02:08:56,068
...you were President of the Reichsbank
during the war?

1575
02:08:56,153 --> 02:08:57,153
l was, yes.

1576
02:08:57,362 --> 02:09:00,448
And you accepted unusual deposits
into your bank, didn't you?

1577
02:09:00,989 --> 02:09:02,824
l do not know what you refer to.

1578
02:09:02,908 --> 02:09:07,328
l am referring to deposits sent to you
by the SS from concentration camps.

1579
02:09:07,496 --> 02:09:09,414
l have no knowledge of...

1580
02:09:09,497 --> 02:09:13,210
lnside the Reichsbank vaults,
there were literally piles of jewelry.

1581
02:09:13,668 --> 02:09:17,588
Gold watches, gold earrings,
gold eyeglass frames.

1582
02:09:18,297 --> 02:09:19,675
And gold teeth!

1583
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:23,177
Many people deposit valuables in a bank...

1584
02:09:23,427 --> 02:09:25,889
...and the bank is not required
to look into them.

1585
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:29,851
Prior to 1939, exactly how many
of your customers...

1586
02:09:30,018 --> 02:09:32,395
...deposited their teeth into your bank?

1587
02:09:43,322 --> 02:09:46,408
You've heard a guard at Mauthausen
concentration camp testify...

1588
02:09:46,490 --> 02:09:50,869
...that you watched while the gas chamber
was demonstrated on inmates.

1589
02:09:51,412 --> 02:09:54,081
l never set foot in Mauthausen!

1590
02:09:54,289 --> 02:09:57,752
And we have heard eyewitness testimony
from three people...

1591
02:09:57,793 --> 02:09:59,962
...that you were at Mauthausen
three times.

1592
02:10:00,046 --> 02:10:00,755
They are lying!

1593
02:10:00,837 --> 02:10:02,090
And before he died...

1594
02:10:02,131 --> 02:10:04,884
...the commandant at Mauthausen
signed this statement...

1595
02:10:04,966 --> 02:10:09,179
...that you ordered him to put
65,000 Jews in a tunnel and seal it off...

1596
02:10:09,262 --> 02:10:11,974
...rather than allow them
to be liberated by the Allies.

1597
02:10:12,056 --> 02:10:12,932
He is lying!

1598
02:10:13,015 --> 02:10:16,226
ls it not a fact that you are lying
to the Tribunal about this...

1599
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:19,021
...as you lied about everything else
in your testimony?

1600
02:10:19,104 --> 02:10:20,272
That is also a lie!

1601
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:31,783
Kaltenbrunner has asked the commandant
of Auschwitz testify in his defense.

1602
02:10:32,952 --> 02:10:36,539
- lf that's a joke, l don't get it.
- l don't get it either, but it's no joke.

1603
02:10:36,622 --> 02:10:40,584
The British have him in custody
and agree to transfer him here to testify.

1604
02:10:40,792 --> 02:10:43,711
Maybe he just figures
he'll look better by comparison.

1605
02:10:44,337 --> 02:10:46,298
We're not going to allow this, are we?

1606
02:10:46,381 --> 02:10:50,343
Let the guy walk in, say God knows what
on the stand, give Kaltenbrunner an alibi?

1607
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:55,555
Might be a cheap price to pay
for the opportunity to cross-examine him.

1608
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:01,853
During the entire time you were
commandant of Auschwitz...

1609
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:06,106
...did Ernst Kaltenbrunner
ever visit the camp?

1610
02:11:07,025 --> 02:11:07,693
No.

1611
02:11:08,027 --> 02:11:08,860
Not once?

1612
02:11:13,739 --> 02:11:14,532
Never.

1613
02:11:16,743 --> 02:11:17,660
Thank you.

1614
02:11:19,494 --> 02:11:20,997
One minute, please.

1615
02:11:30,963 --> 02:11:32,006
Mr. Hoess.

1616
02:11:32,466 --> 02:11:35,760
How long were you commandant
of Auschwitz concentration camp?

1617
02:11:36,552 --> 02:11:37,720
From the beginning.

1618
02:11:37,804 --> 02:11:39,221
And what was its purpose?

1619
02:11:39,430 --> 02:11:40,722
At that time...

1620
02:11:40,805 --> 02:11:44,059
...to house prisoners who were being held
in protective custody.

1621
02:11:44,935 --> 02:11:45,978
And after that?

1622
02:11:46,479 --> 02:11:49,190
l was called to Berlin by my boss...

1623
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:52,025
...Reichsfuhrer Himmler, in 1941.

1624
02:11:52,818 --> 02:11:56,697
And he informed me
that the Fuhrer had ordered...

1625
02:11:56,779 --> 02:11:59,407
...the final solution of the Jewish question.

1626
02:12:00,033 --> 02:12:02,786
l was not sure what l was supposed to do.

1627
02:12:03,619 --> 02:12:08,373
So Adolf Eichmann advised me
to visit a camp at Treblinka...

1628
02:12:08,666 --> 02:12:10,333
...to learn from its operation.

1629
02:12:10,417 --> 02:12:12,043
And what did you learn there?

1630
02:12:12,545 --> 02:12:14,630
Actually, l was not impressed.

1631
02:12:15,088 --> 02:12:18,132
lt was taking the commandant there
six months...

1632
02:12:18,466 --> 02:12:22,262
...to eliminate 80,000 Jews
using monoxide gas.

1633
02:12:23,221 --> 02:12:24,722
l had a better idea.

1634
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,016
One of my Auschwitz guards...

1635
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:31,729
...had accidentally sniffed
a chemical disinfectant called Zyklon B...

1636
02:12:32,730 --> 02:12:34,565
...and had passed out immediately.

1637
02:12:34,983 --> 02:12:39,070
lt occurred to me,
if a little of this chemical killed lice...

1638
02:12:39,612 --> 02:12:42,448
...enough, perhaps, would kill a human.

1639
02:12:44,115 --> 02:12:48,412
l tested it on Soviet prisoners of war
locked in a room, and it worked.

1640
02:12:48,953 --> 02:12:52,122
Within 3 to 15 minutes, they were dead.

1641
02:12:54,208 --> 02:12:54,960
And then?

1642
02:12:55,127 --> 02:12:58,672
l built gas chambers to accommodate
2,000 inmates at a time...

1643
02:12:59,046 --> 02:13:01,173
...compared to Treblinka's 200.

1644
02:13:01,591 --> 02:13:04,803
And l built four large ovens
to cremate the remains.

1645
02:13:05,261 --> 02:13:09,348
lt became possible to eliminate
10,000 people in 24 hours.

1646
02:13:10,015 --> 02:13:13,726
But that was at peak operation,
which was exhausting for my staff.

1647
02:13:14,435 --> 02:13:16,979
On the average, we would dispatch...

1648
02:13:17,064 --> 02:13:18,523
...2,000 people a day.

1649
02:13:20,233 --> 02:13:24,195
How many men did it take
to dispatch 2,000 people a day?

1650
02:13:24,487 --> 02:13:27,573
l had a staff of approximately 3,000 men.

1651
02:13:28,783 --> 02:13:31,203
And during your tenure at Auschwitz...

1652
02:13:31,368 --> 02:13:33,996
...how many people did you dispose of
in this fashion?

1653
02:13:34,288 --> 02:13:36,373
Approximately two and a half million.

1654
02:13:44,965 --> 02:13:46,175
No further questions.

1655
02:13:46,257 --> 02:13:47,759
l wish to make this clear.

1656
02:13:49,176 --> 02:13:51,720
l did not tolerate gratuitous cruelty.

1657
02:13:53,222 --> 02:13:56,225
My men were there to exterminate people,
not torment them.

1658
02:13:56,975 --> 02:13:59,311
Any misconduct by the guards
was punished.

1659
02:13:59,979 --> 02:14:01,021
l can assure you.

1660
02:14:05,984 --> 02:14:07,654
The witness is excused.

1661
02:14:09,613 --> 02:14:12,490
Court is adjourned
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

1662
02:14:32,551 --> 02:14:34,636
My life was entirely normal.

1663
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,722
Even while doing this extermination work...

1664
02:14:39,349 --> 02:14:42,811
...l would say l led
a perfectly normal family life.

1665
02:14:43,561 --> 02:14:45,855
How would you describe that life?

1666
02:14:46,523 --> 02:14:48,442
l've always been happiest alone.

1667
02:14:49,234 --> 02:14:52,654
l never had any real intimacy
with my parents, my sisters--

1668
02:14:55,073 --> 02:14:56,282
Do you feel...

1669
02:14:57,492 --> 02:15:00,536
...that the Jews you murdered
deserved their fate?

1670
02:15:01,619 --> 02:15:05,373
l have always been taught
that the Jew was an enemy of Germany.

1671
02:15:05,998 --> 02:15:09,418
So when you were ordered to turn
your prison camp into a death camp...

1672
02:15:11,128 --> 02:15:15,507
...you never once thought
what you were doing was wrong?

1673
02:15:17,009 --> 02:15:18,302
l was an SS man.

1674
02:15:19,095 --> 02:15:21,555
We were trained to obey orders
without thinking.

1675
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:25,893
Does a rat-catcher think it is wrong
to kill rats?

1676
02:15:46,787 --> 02:15:48,873
A rat catcher catching rats.

1677
02:15:49,957 --> 02:15:53,752
ls that the kind of thinking it takes to
carry out state-sanctioned mass murder?

1678
02:15:53,836 --> 02:15:58,048
Not just blind obedience, but also a belief
that your victims are not human?

1679
02:15:59,841 --> 02:16:02,885
Let me ask you this. What was Hiroshima?

1680
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:05,846
Was it not your medical experiment?

1681
02:16:06,097 --> 02:16:08,809
Would America have dropped bombs
as easily on Germany...

1682
02:16:08,891 --> 02:16:12,519
...as it did upon Japan,
killing as many civilians as possible?

1683
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:16,148
l think not. To an American's sensibility...

1684
02:16:17,108 --> 02:16:20,653
...a Caucasian child is considerably
more human than a Japanese child.

1685
02:16:20,735 --> 02:16:22,653
America was at war with Japan.

1686
02:16:22,738 --> 02:16:25,574
A country that had attacked it
without provocation.

1687
02:16:25,614 --> 02:16:28,534
You murdered millions
of your own citizens.

1688
02:16:28,618 --> 02:16:31,330
What about the American citizens
of the Japanese race...

1689
02:16:31,412 --> 02:16:34,540
...put into ''protective custody''
in your own concentration camps?

1690
02:16:34,625 --> 02:16:35,541
That was wrong.

1691
02:16:35,626 --> 02:16:39,004
Why was this not done to Americans
of ltalian and German descent?

1692
02:16:39,086 --> 02:16:40,546
l said it was wrong.

1693
02:16:41,088 --> 02:16:43,591
What about the Negro officers
in your own army?

1694
02:16:44,007 --> 02:16:46,260
Are they allowed
to command troops in combat?

1695
02:16:46,343 --> 02:16:48,553
Can they sit on the same buses
as the whites?

1696
02:16:48,929 --> 02:16:51,932
Segregation laws in your country
and anti-Semitic laws in mine:

1697
02:16:52,015 --> 02:16:54,141
Are they not just a difference of degree?

1698
02:16:54,226 --> 02:16:56,728
Let me tell you,
from the beginning of the century...

1699
02:16:56,811 --> 02:16:59,314
...through the First War
until the rise of Hitler...

1700
02:16:59,397 --> 02:17:01,649
...the freemasonry
of the Jewish merchants...

1701
02:17:01,691 --> 02:17:04,193
...consistently undermined
the German economy...

1702
02:17:04,277 --> 02:17:08,031
...and the nationhood of the fatherland.
That is why we made anti-Semitic laws.

1703
02:17:08,114 --> 02:17:11,743
And why you, my friend,
can never understand anti-Semitism. Why?

1704
02:17:11,909 --> 02:17:14,870
Because you are a Jew.

1705
02:17:39,309 --> 02:17:41,603
ls defense counsel ready to proceed?

1706
02:17:41,896 --> 02:17:43,523
Ready, Your Honor.

1707
02:17:44,065 --> 02:17:48,986
Herr Sauckel, from March, 1942,
you were in charge of procuring labor...

1708
02:17:49,111 --> 02:17:51,195
...for the war effort. ls that right?

1709
02:17:51,738 --> 02:17:52,530
Ja.

1710
02:17:52,906 --> 02:17:56,118
You are aware that it was a crime
under the Hague Convention...

1711
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:00,829
...to forcibly deport citizens
of other countries to Germany as workers?

1712
02:18:00,871 --> 02:18:01,706
Ja.

1713
02:18:01,789 --> 02:18:04,792
How many foreign workers
came into Germany during your tenure?

1714
02:18:05,251 --> 02:18:07,460
Approximately five million.

1715
02:18:07,628 --> 02:18:09,922
And how many of them came voluntarily?

1716
02:18:10,254 --> 02:18:12,548
Perhaps 200,000.

1717
02:18:13,549 --> 02:18:17,219
Did you issue these directives
calling for their decent treatment?

1718
02:18:17,888 --> 02:18:19,265
l did.

1719
02:18:19,932 --> 02:18:23,644
l ask that these be marked as exhibits
and accepted into evidence.

1720
02:18:23,727 --> 02:18:25,103
So ordered.

1721
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:30,191
Herr Sauckel, who ordered you
to procure these workers?

1722
02:18:33,361 --> 02:18:34,362
Speer.

1723
02:18:35,111 --> 02:18:39,198
Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments.
He gave orders to you?

1724
02:18:39,282 --> 02:18:40,074
Ja.

1725
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:42,119
- And you had to obey them?
- Ja.

1726
02:18:42,201 --> 02:18:45,871
Every worker you brought in,
it was under Speer's orders?

1727
02:18:45,914 --> 02:18:47,123
lt was.

1728
02:18:47,915 --> 02:18:49,750
No further questions.

1729
02:19:03,472 --> 02:19:07,393
l know this is unorthodox, Mr. Dodd,
to request an audience with you...

1730
02:19:07,476 --> 02:19:09,603
...the man assigned to cross-examine me.

1731
02:19:09,727 --> 02:19:13,481
There's nothing very orthodox
about this whole trial, Dr. Speer.

1732
02:19:13,565 --> 02:19:16,693
My lawyer's trying to talk me out
of confessing to war crimes...

1733
02:19:16,775 --> 02:19:19,028
...that might incur the death penalty.

1734
02:19:19,154 --> 02:19:21,823
l do not wish to hide the truth
just to save my life...

1735
02:19:21,906 --> 02:19:24,325
...only to hate myself
for the rest of that life.

1736
02:19:24,407 --> 02:19:27,786
- l wish other defendants shared that view.
- Some of them do.

1737
02:19:27,911 --> 02:19:30,039
Many are still under Goring's influence.

1738
02:19:30,122 --> 02:19:32,791
He's your chief rival for the souls
of other defendants...

1739
02:19:32,875 --> 02:19:34,709
...if l may put it so dramatically.

1740
02:19:34,793 --> 02:19:38,297
Goring was cross-examined
by the chief prosecutor, Justice Jackson...

1741
02:19:38,379 --> 02:19:40,923
...while l am to be questioned by you,
a subordinate.

1742
02:19:41,967 --> 02:19:44,469
This difference was noticed
by the other defendants.

1743
02:19:44,552 --> 02:19:47,388
ln their eyes, it puts me
in an inferior status to Goring.

1744
02:19:48,597 --> 02:19:51,768
That's a peculiar measure of status,
Dr. Speer.

1745
02:19:52,643 --> 02:19:54,561
Not to a German war criminal.

1746
02:19:56,438 --> 02:19:58,481
l hope you don't have a problem with it.

1747
02:19:59,023 --> 02:20:01,609
No. l've got no ego riding on this.

1748
02:20:02,027 --> 02:20:04,654
l'll present your request
to my superior, Mr. Jackson.

1749
02:20:07,199 --> 02:20:10,786
Dr. Speer, did you disapprove
of Sauckel's recruitment of labor?

1750
02:20:11,077 --> 02:20:12,620
On the contrary.

1751
02:20:12,703 --> 02:20:15,789
l was grateful to Sauckel
for every worker he provided.

1752
02:20:16,207 --> 02:20:18,251
When we failed to meet
armament quotas...

1753
02:20:18,376 --> 02:20:21,379
...because of shortage of workers,
l would blame Sauckel.

1754
02:20:23,673 --> 02:20:27,968
Do you wish to limit your responsibility
to your own particular sphere of work?

1755
02:20:28,051 --> 02:20:32,847
No. This war has brought
an inconceivable catastrophe.

1756
02:20:33,181 --> 02:20:35,975
As an important member
of the leadership of the Reich...

1757
02:20:36,016 --> 02:20:40,688
...l share in the total responsibility
for the disaster of the German people.

1758
02:20:40,771 --> 02:20:44,192
Dr. Speer, near the end of the war,
did you not refuse to carry out...

1759
02:20:44,316 --> 02:20:46,860
...Hitler's order to raze Germany
to the ground?

1760
02:20:46,944 --> 02:20:50,364
l've no intention of using my actions
during that phase of the war...

1761
02:20:50,448 --> 02:20:52,742
...to help me in my personal defense.

1762
02:20:53,408 --> 02:20:56,119
But l would like those
who sit in judgment of me...

1763
02:20:56,202 --> 02:20:57,829
...to understand that period.

1764
02:20:58,664 --> 02:21:01,625
ln March of 1945,
Hitler intended, deliberately...

1765
02:21:01,708 --> 02:21:06,087
...to destroy the means of life
for his own people if the war were lost.

1766
02:21:07,629 --> 02:21:10,674
He said, ''Let the Allies conquer
nothing but ashes.''

1767
02:21:11,132 --> 02:21:16,305
But you resisted his wishes,
sending him instead this memorandum.

1768
02:21:16,889 --> 02:21:19,558
Would you read it to the court, please?

1769
02:21:21,269 --> 02:21:24,897
''Nobody has the right to destroy
industrial plants...

1770
02:21:25,105 --> 02:21:29,400
''...coal mines, electrical plants,
and other facilities.

1771
02:21:29,985 --> 02:21:34,656
''We have no right to carry out destruction
which might affect the life of the people.

1772
02:21:35,406 --> 02:21:37,074
''Signed, Speer.''

1773
02:21:38,784 --> 02:21:43,329
We have heard here that people were shot
for disagreeing with Hitler.

1774
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:45,791
ls this true?

1775
02:21:46,959 --> 02:21:48,085
That did happen.

1776
02:21:48,167 --> 02:21:51,046
And yet, not only did you disagree
with him...

1777
02:21:51,087 --> 02:21:54,967
...but early in 1945 you actually made
a plan to assassinate Hitler.

1778
02:21:55,217 --> 02:21:56,426
He what?

1779
02:22:01,889 --> 02:22:03,390
ls that not so?

1780
02:22:07,145 --> 02:22:08,229
Yes, it is so.

1781
02:22:08,313 --> 02:22:09,147
Traitor!

1782
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:12,692
lt is so...

1783
02:22:13,274 --> 02:22:16,736
...because of what l viewed
as his insane destructiveness.

1784
02:22:17,779 --> 02:22:18,863
What did you do?

1785
02:22:18,947 --> 02:22:20,114
What was your plan?

1786
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:32,460
l knew of an air-intake shaft...

1787
02:22:33,378 --> 02:22:38,341
...in the Reich Chancellery garden
that ventilated the Fuhrerbunker below.

1788
02:22:39,132 --> 02:22:42,552
l went to the head
of my munitions department and said:

1789
02:22:43,845 --> 02:22:46,681
''There's only one way to end this war.''...

1790
02:22:47,558 --> 02:22:49,601
...and asked him to get me...

1791
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:54,229
...a poison gas to drop
into the ventilating system.

1792
02:22:55,272 --> 02:22:58,567
But the next time l went there,
they had built a 12-foot chimney...

1793
02:22:58,650 --> 02:23:02,404
...protecting the ventilator,
and SS guards were patrolling there.

1794
02:23:02,530 --> 02:23:05,909
So it came to nothing.

1795
02:23:13,207 --> 02:23:14,500
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?

1796
02:23:17,628 --> 02:23:21,590
You acknowledge responsibility
for Germany's large policies...

1797
02:23:21,673 --> 02:23:24,342
...but not for the details occurred
in their execution.

1798
02:23:24,384 --> 02:23:27,844
- ls that a fair statement of your position?
- Yes, sir. Very fair.

1799
02:23:28,345 --> 02:23:31,974
May l ask the witness a question
in order to clarify this answer, please?

1800
02:23:32,349 --> 02:23:33,100
You may.

1801
02:23:34,893 --> 02:23:38,021
Do you want to acknowledge guilt
under criminal law...

1802
02:23:38,271 --> 02:23:41,900
...or do you wish to record
a historical responsibility...

1803
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:45,069
...before your own people
and before history?

1804
02:23:57,122 --> 02:23:59,500
The question is a very difficult one
to answer.

1805
02:24:01,252 --> 02:24:05,255
lt is actually one which the Tribunal...

1806
02:24:06,465 --> 02:24:09,759
...will decide in its verdict.

1807
02:24:32,948 --> 02:24:34,282
Cuffs off!

1808
02:24:35,075 --> 02:24:37,244
You would assassinate the Fuhrer?

1809
02:24:37,576 --> 02:24:39,036
l tell you this, coward.

1810
02:24:39,078 --> 02:24:42,082
lf you get out alive,
we'll put together our own court...

1811
02:24:42,122 --> 02:24:43,790
...and execute you for treason!

1812
02:24:43,875 --> 02:24:44,916
Lock them up!

1813
02:24:53,134 --> 02:24:58,096
As a German officer, l consider it my duty
to answer for all l have done.

1814
02:24:59,724 --> 02:25:04,019
lt will not always be possible to separate
guilt from the threads of destiny.

1815
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:08,522
But the men in the front lines
cannot be charged with guilt...

1816
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:11,860
...while the highest leaders
reject responsibility.

1817
02:25:12,610 --> 02:25:13,694
That is wrong.

1818
02:25:13,778 --> 02:25:15,570
lt was my guilt...

1819
02:25:16,531 --> 02:25:19,909
...which l carry before God
and the entire German nation...

1820
02:25:21,409 --> 02:25:24,996
...that l educated the youth of Germany
for a man who l considered to be...

1821
02:25:25,079 --> 02:25:28,291
...an impeccable leader and head of state.

1822
02:25:29,084 --> 02:25:31,503
But l educated the youth of Germany...

1823
02:25:32,837 --> 02:25:36,674
...for a man who committed murder
a millionfold.

1824
02:25:36,757 --> 02:25:40,469
And this guilt of Germany
will not yet be erased.

1825
02:25:51,729 --> 02:25:53,397
Good afternoon, Captain.

1826
02:25:55,900 --> 02:25:57,860
The prisoners aren't allowed visitors.

1827
02:25:58,236 --> 02:26:00,655
l am the wife of Reichsmarschall Goring.

1828
02:26:00,822 --> 02:26:02,281
This is his daughter.

1829
02:26:03,281 --> 02:26:05,076
No exceptions, ma'am.

1830
02:26:06,577 --> 02:26:08,037
Frau Goring.

1831
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,459
- My name is Captain Gilbert.
- Hello.

1832
02:26:14,502 --> 02:26:18,172
Nice to meet you. Would you have
a moment to spend with me, to talk?

1833
02:26:18,213 --> 02:26:19,255
Yes.

1834
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:21,174
- Very good.
- This is Edda.

1835
02:26:21,257 --> 02:26:24,719
Hello, Edda. l'm Captain Gilbert.
Do you like chocolate?

1836
02:26:30,308 --> 02:26:33,436
lt must have been very difficult for you
these last few months.

1837
02:26:33,519 --> 02:26:35,604
Especially with your little girl.

1838
02:26:35,688 --> 02:26:40,067
lt could have been worse, l suppose.
Hitler could have survived.

1839
02:26:41,693 --> 02:26:44,112
You've obviously come to terms
with the truth.

1840
02:26:44,738 --> 02:26:46,781
l wish your husband could do the same.

1841
02:26:46,865 --> 02:26:50,201
But he persists in remaining loyal
to Hitler's memory.

1842
02:26:50,244 --> 02:26:53,122
Yes, l cannot understand it, either.

1843
02:26:53,704 --> 02:26:57,334
Such loyalty to a man
who wanted us dead.

1844
02:26:59,209 --> 02:27:02,004
- l'm sorry?
- Hitler ordered all of us to be shot.

1845
02:27:03,172 --> 02:27:04,674
Hermann, myself...

1846
02:27:04,881 --> 02:27:06,424
...our precious child.

1847
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:10,304
That is why we surrendered
to the Americans.

1848
02:27:10,387 --> 02:27:12,471
Why else would we have done
such a thing?

1849
02:27:21,065 --> 02:27:23,274
l went through my notes last night.

1850
02:27:23,649 --> 02:27:27,404
l've spent all these months trying
to find a way inside their minds.

1851
02:27:27,486 --> 02:27:31,406
Hoping to understand how those people
could commit such atrocities...

1852
02:27:31,490 --> 02:27:33,575
...against my people.

1853
02:27:35,286 --> 02:27:38,872
l believe there are a couple of factors
that explain a lot of it.

1854
02:27:39,247 --> 02:27:43,084
First, Germany is a country
where people do what they're told.

1855
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:48,213
You obey your parents, teachers,
clergymen, superior officers.

1856
02:27:48,255 --> 02:27:51,885
You're raised from childhood
not to question authority.

1857
02:27:52,427 --> 02:27:55,763
When Hitler comes to power,
he has an entire nation that believes...

1858
02:27:55,888 --> 02:27:58,682
...it's perfectly natural
to do whatever he says.

1859
02:27:59,641 --> 02:28:01,935
Second, propaganda.

1860
02:28:02,770 --> 02:28:06,231
For years, Germans have been bombarded
with ideas like:

1861
02:28:06,731 --> 02:28:11,694
''Jews are not real human beings,''
or ''They're a corruption of the race.''

1862
02:28:13,988 --> 02:28:18,575
When the government says it's permissible
to deny Jews their rights...

1863
02:28:18,826 --> 02:28:24,748
...and then says it's imperative to kill
these inferior people...

1864
02:28:26,666 --> 02:28:28,420
...they comply.

1865
02:28:30,087 --> 02:28:33,256
Even if they've been
your friends or neighbors.

1866
02:28:40,471 --> 02:28:41,681
Anything else?

1867
02:28:41,764 --> 02:28:44,850
l told you once that l was searching
for the nature of evil.

1868
02:28:45,852 --> 02:28:48,313
l think l've come close to defining it.

1869
02:28:49,855 --> 02:28:51,315
A lack of empathy.

1870
02:28:51,691 --> 02:28:55,444
lt's the one characteristic
that connects all the defendants.

1871
02:28:55,486 --> 02:28:59,448
A genuine incapacity
to feel with their fellow man.

1872
02:29:02,075 --> 02:29:07,331
Evil, l think, is the absence of empathy.

1873
02:29:19,509 --> 02:29:23,012
l call on the chief prosecutor
for his closing argument.

1874
02:29:32,688 --> 02:29:35,522
Mr. President and members of the tribunal.

1875
02:29:37,358 --> 02:29:42,363
lt is impossible in summation to do more
than outline with bold strokes...

1876
02:29:42,948 --> 02:29:47,202
...the vitals of this trial's mad
and melancholy record.

1877
02:29:47,243 --> 02:29:51,414
For no time has ever witnessed
slaughter on such a grand scale.

1878
02:29:52,665 --> 02:29:57,253
Such cruelties and inhumanities,
such wholesale deportations...

1879
02:29:58,170 --> 02:30:02,424
...of peoples into slavery,
such annihilations of minorities.

1880
02:30:04,718 --> 02:30:09,180
Events which will live
as the historical text...

1881
02:30:09,221 --> 02:30:14,977
...of the 20th century's
shame and depravity.

1882
02:30:15,853 --> 02:30:17,688
Terror was the order of the day.

1883
02:30:17,772 --> 02:30:21,234
Civilians were arrested without charges,
committed without counsel...

1884
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:24,236
...executed without hearing.

1885
02:30:26,237 --> 02:30:29,615
Villages were destroyed,
the male inhabitants shot...

1886
02:30:31,033 --> 02:30:32,743
...or sent to forced labor...

1887
02:30:32,911 --> 02:30:35,496
...and the children scattered abroad.

1888
02:30:36,747 --> 02:30:41,710
The Nazi movement will be of evil memory
because of its persecution of the Jews...

1889
02:30:42,585 --> 02:30:46,172
...the most far-flung
and terrible racial persecution of all time.

1890
02:30:47,924 --> 02:30:51,887
So thorough and uncompromising was
this program that the Jews of Europe...

1891
02:30:52,013 --> 02:30:54,097
...as a race, no longer exist.

1892
02:30:55,433 --> 02:30:59,603
Thus fulfilling the diabolic ''prophesy''
of Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the war.

1893
02:30:59,685 --> 02:31:02,689
Generations to come
will remember this decade.

1894
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:06,400
lf we cannot eliminate the cause...

1895
02:31:07,025 --> 02:31:09,820
...and prevent the repetition
of these barbaric events...

1896
02:31:09,904 --> 02:31:12,073
...this century may yet succeed...

1897
02:31:13,156 --> 02:31:15,575
...in bringing the doom of civilization.

1898
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:21,998
The time has come for final judgment
and if the case l present seems hard...

1899
02:31:22,122 --> 02:31:24,458
...and uncompromising...

1900
02:31:25,084 --> 02:31:28,296
...then it is only because
the evidence makes it so.

1901
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:33,510
A glance at the dock will show
that despite quarrels among themselves...

1902
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:37,263
...each defendant played a part
that fitted in with every other...

1903
02:31:37,305 --> 02:31:39,849
...and all advanced a common plan.

1904
02:31:41,683 --> 02:31:45,103
lt was these men among millions of others,
and it was these men...

1905
02:31:45,228 --> 02:31:48,231
...leading millions of others,
who built up Adolf Hitler.

1906
02:31:48,315 --> 02:31:49,649
They intoxicated him.

1907
02:31:49,691 --> 02:31:52,944
He, of the psychopathic personality...

1908
02:31:53,028 --> 02:31:56,155
...with power and adulation.

1909
02:31:57,656 --> 02:32:00,158
They fed his hates, aroused his fears.

1910
02:32:01,159 --> 02:32:05,164
They put a loaded gun in his eager hands.
lt was left to Hitler to pull the trigger.

1911
02:32:05,247 --> 02:32:07,165
When he did, they all...

1912
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:10,043
...at that time, applauded.

1913
02:32:11,170 --> 02:32:13,129
Hitler's guilt stands admitted...

1914
02:32:13,172 --> 02:32:15,506
...by some defendants reluctantly...

1915
02:32:15,591 --> 02:32:17,468
...by some, vindictively.

1916
02:32:18,010 --> 02:32:21,846
But Hitler's guilt is the guilt
of the whole dock...

1917
02:32:24,390 --> 02:32:26,433
...and of every man in it.

1918
02:32:32,981 --> 02:32:36,902
These defendants now ask this tribunal
to say they are not guilty...

1919
02:32:37,443 --> 02:32:40,864
...of planning, executing,
or conspiring to commit...

1920
02:32:41,031 --> 02:32:45,536
...this long list of crimes and wrongs.

1921
02:32:48,496 --> 02:32:52,250
They stand before the record of
this Tribunal as bloodstained Gloucester...

1922
02:32:52,334 --> 02:32:54,836
...stood by the body of his slain king.

1923
02:32:57,087 --> 02:33:00,632
He begged the widow, as they beg of you:

1924
02:33:02,134 --> 02:33:04,011
''Say l slew them not.''

1925
02:33:05,219 --> 02:33:08,556
And the Queen replied,
''Then say they are not slain.

1926
02:33:11,226 --> 02:33:12,727
''But dead they are.''

1927
02:33:14,438 --> 02:33:19,192
lf you were to say of these men
that they are not guilty...

1928
02:33:20,818 --> 02:33:24,530
...it would be as true to say
that there has been no war.

1929
02:33:26,365 --> 02:33:28,117
There are no slain.

1930
02:33:31,495 --> 02:33:33,414
There has been no crime.

1931
02:34:02,316 --> 02:34:03,567
Captain.

1932
02:34:04,525 --> 02:34:08,572
''Jews escalate fight for homeland.''
lt's ironic.

1933
02:34:09,698 --> 02:34:12,157
After all that's happened
over the past 10 years...

1934
02:34:12,242 --> 02:34:14,661
...l don't blame the Jews
for wanting a homeland.

1935
02:34:14,744 --> 02:34:18,497
One of the many ripples we'll see
from this war and from this trial.

1936
02:34:19,790 --> 02:34:21,792
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1937
02:34:23,002 --> 02:34:25,879
The defendants may now
make their final statements.

1938
02:34:26,798 --> 02:34:28,799
Defendant Hermann Goring.

1939
02:34:43,188 --> 02:34:45,940
This has been a poor excuse for a trial.

1940
02:34:49,317 --> 02:34:52,654
But firstly, l must reiterate
my lack of knowledge...

1941
02:34:52,945 --> 02:34:57,575
...for these terrible mass murders,
which l cannot begin to understand...

1942
02:34:58,493 --> 02:35:02,831
...and furthermore,
l condemn wholeheartedly.

1943
02:35:03,832 --> 02:35:07,711
As to the trial, the statements
of the defendants were accepted as true...

1944
02:35:07,835 --> 02:35:10,462
...only when they supported
the prosecution.

1945
02:35:11,172 --> 02:35:14,300
They were treated as perjury
when they refuted the indictment.

1946
02:35:14,717 --> 02:35:16,927
This is not a basis of proof.

1947
02:35:17,052 --> 02:35:21,139
Why am l in the dock being treated
as a common criminal?

1948
02:35:22,975 --> 02:35:26,560
l say to my judges, have no illusions.

1949
02:35:27,436 --> 02:35:31,608
Since the three greatest powers on earth,
together with other nations fought us...

1950
02:35:31,691 --> 02:35:36,237
...we finally were conquered
by tremendous enemy superiority.

1951
02:35:36,736 --> 02:35:41,367
Justice has absolutely nothing
to do with this trial.

1952
02:35:55,379 --> 02:35:57,423
Defendant Albert Speer.

1953
02:36:02,302 --> 02:36:07,140
How could so advanced, so cultured...

1954
02:36:08,308 --> 02:36:11,185
...so sophisticated a nation as Germany...

1955
02:36:11,936 --> 02:36:14,606
...have fallen under Hitler's demonic sway?

1956
02:36:15,858 --> 02:36:18,986
The explanation
is modern communications.

1957
02:36:20,279 --> 02:36:24,658
No longer does a leader have to delegate
authority afar to subordinates...

1958
02:36:24,992 --> 02:36:27,244
...exercising independent judgment.

1959
02:36:27,661 --> 02:36:31,997
Given modern communications,
a Hitler can rule directly and personally.

1960
02:36:32,957 --> 02:36:35,917
Thus, the more technical
the world becomes...

1961
02:36:36,084 --> 02:36:38,711
...the more individual freedom...

1962
02:36:39,171 --> 02:36:42,049
...and the self-rule of mankind
becomes essential.

1963
02:36:43,592 --> 02:36:48,763
This war has ended on the note
of radio-controlled rockets.

1964
02:36:49,722 --> 02:36:52,101
Aircraft approaching the speed of sound.

1965
02:36:52,351 --> 02:36:55,436
Submarines and torpedoes
which can find their own targets.

1966
02:36:55,561 --> 02:36:56,896
Atom bombs...

1967
02:36:57,104 --> 02:37:00,065
...and the horrible prospect
of chemical warfare.

1968
02:37:00,483 --> 02:37:05,112
ln five to ten years, this kind of warfare
will offer the possibility of firing rockets...

1969
02:37:05,195 --> 02:37:08,615
...from continent to continent
with uncanny precision.

1970
02:37:09,867 --> 02:37:11,951
Through the smashing of the atom...

1971
02:37:12,995 --> 02:37:17,374
...it will be possible to kill 1 million people
in New York City in a matter of seconds...

1972
02:37:17,457 --> 02:37:20,210
...with a rocket serviced
by perhaps ten men.

1973
02:37:21,918 --> 02:37:26,298
A new large-scale war will end
with the destruction...

1974
02:37:26,466 --> 02:37:29,051
...of human culture and civilization.

1975
02:37:29,386 --> 02:37:32,430
That is why this trial must contribute...

1976
02:37:33,306 --> 02:37:36,141
...to the prevention
of such wars in the future.

1977
02:37:37,977 --> 02:37:41,397
A nation believing in its future
will never perish.

1978
02:37:42,064 --> 02:37:45,692
May God protect Germany...

1979
02:37:47,485 --> 02:37:49,444
...and the culture of the West.

1980
02:37:59,328 --> 02:38:04,084
We are agreed. Three of four votes
will be required for the finding of guilty.

1981
02:38:04,835 --> 02:38:06,170
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

1982
02:38:06,295 --> 02:38:10,256
Now, if the judgment is death,
might we not consider...

1983
02:38:10,341 --> 02:38:13,050
...the firing squad
for the military defendants?

1984
02:38:13,135 --> 02:38:14,886
l disagree most strongly.

1985
02:38:15,011 --> 02:38:18,390
The bullet is for the honorable adversary,
not for butchers.

1986
02:38:19,349 --> 02:38:20,808
l say hanging.

1987
02:38:21,183 --> 02:38:22,851
- l agree.
- l agree.

1988
02:38:25,938 --> 02:38:29,358
We will take the defendants
in the order they were indicted.

1989
02:38:29,608 --> 02:38:30,525
Goring.

1990
02:38:38,908 --> 02:38:40,493
Bravo.

1991
02:38:51,004 --> 02:38:53,422
Go on, have some of the lovely food.

1992
02:38:58,176 --> 02:39:00,887
There is talk that you will all be hanged.

1993
02:39:01,721 --> 02:39:03,139
l won't be hanged.

1994
02:39:04,724 --> 02:39:08,353
That l assure you. That l pledge.

1995
02:39:09,936 --> 02:39:13,984
Perhaps the court
will send you to an island, like Elba.

1996
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:16,903
We could join you there.

1997
02:39:21,449 --> 02:39:22,950
Go on, eat.

1998
02:39:25,827 --> 02:39:30,582
Do you think that we would be allowed
to take some of the food home with us?

1999
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:39,631
l don't see why not.

2000
02:39:40,674 --> 02:39:43,635
The Charter clearly states
that following orders...

2001
02:39:44,177 --> 02:39:47,431
...''may be considered in mitigation
of punishment.''

2002
02:39:47,889 --> 02:39:50,225
''May be,'' not must be.

2003
02:39:54,438 --> 02:39:58,524
You have become
such beautiful young ladies.

2004
02:40:03,822 --> 02:40:05,864
When are they going to shoot you, Papa?

2005
02:40:07,450 --> 02:40:09,786
Hans Frank is a most tragic figure...

2006
02:40:09,994 --> 02:40:11,037
...in my view.

2007
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:13,164
His penitence is obviously real.

2008
02:40:13,706 --> 02:40:16,959
lt would be a meaningful gesture
for us to spare his life.

2009
02:40:17,792 --> 02:40:18,584
No.

2010
02:40:18,793 --> 02:40:19,878
He should hang.

2011
02:40:58,997 --> 02:41:00,665
Atten-hut!

2012
02:41:05,754 --> 02:41:07,005
All rise.

2013
02:41:46,209 --> 02:41:49,879
Each defendant will stand
as his name is called...

2014
02:41:50,212 --> 02:41:53,757
...to hear the judgments
on the four counts applicable to him...

2015
02:41:54,509 --> 02:41:58,054
...and the sentence,
if found guilty on any of the counts.

2016
02:41:59,055 --> 02:42:02,600
The counts, numbered one
through four, are:

2017

2041
02:43:29,389 --> 02:43:32,350
...has not been established
beyond a reasonable doubt...

2042
02:43:32,476 --> 02:43:36,480

The work of this Tribunal is now complete.

2075
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:44,072
Lock them up!

2076
02:46:50,327 --> 02:46:53,663
Leutnant, my dear Tex,
why this long face?

2077
02:46:54,998 --> 02:46:58,459
Have l not told you there's a special place
in Valhalla waiting for me?

2078
02:47:01,004 --> 02:47:02,506
l don't know.

2079
02:47:08,179 --> 02:47:10,681
l thought things might have
turned out differently.

2080
02:47:11,014 --> 02:47:16,019
Well, you know, they might have done,
if it wasn't a very unfortunate thing.

2081
02:47:18,021 --> 02:47:19,480
Those mass murders.

2082
02:47:20,731 --> 02:47:23,484
l must tell you,
l could not see their purpose.

2083
02:47:23,525 --> 02:47:25,860
They were absolutely unnecessary.

2084
02:47:25,903 --> 02:47:28,530
They made no sense
from a nationalistic point of view.

2085
02:47:28,697 --> 02:47:31,200
Our legacy has been forever tainted.

2086
02:47:32,868 --> 02:47:34,369
But make no mistake.

2087
02:47:35,327 --> 02:47:39,040
Everything Hitler did before the war
was right. The German people knew it.

2088
02:47:39,083 --> 02:47:40,834
One day, they'll remember it.

2089
02:47:40,917 --> 02:47:43,711
And you must remember it too,
my dear Tex.

2090
02:47:44,921 --> 02:47:47,340
When you remember me, remember that.

2091
02:47:49,467 --> 02:47:50,385
Yeah.

2092
02:47:52,011 --> 02:47:53,888
Now, to practical matters.

2093
02:47:54,888 --> 02:47:57,599
- There are a few things l want to give you.
- No, sir--

2094
02:47:58,183 --> 02:47:59,226
Please.

2095
02:48:02,688 --> 02:48:05,272
Where l'm going, l must travel light.

2096
02:48:08,775 --> 02:48:12,072
lt's inscribed, see, with my name. Take it.

2097
02:48:13,824 --> 02:48:15,075
Take it.

2098
02:48:23,123 --> 02:48:27,378
The few valuables l have, they are
in my blue briefcase in the baggage room.

2099
02:48:27,418 --> 02:48:30,254
Can you retrieve that for me, my dear Tex?

2100
02:48:32,049 --> 02:48:32,924
Yes, sir.

2101
02:49:05,621 --> 02:49:08,040
Where are they building those gallows?

2102
02:49:08,123 --> 02:49:10,667
Down in the back.
Third building on the right.

2103
02:49:39,319 --> 02:49:41,863
l have only one question to ask you.

2104
02:49:43,615 --> 02:49:47,536
ls there absolutely no possibility that
l may be allowed to face a firing squad...

2105
02:49:47,619 --> 02:49:49,246
...and die a soldier's death?

2106
02:49:49,328 --> 02:49:50,079
None.

2107
02:49:51,289 --> 02:49:54,959
Just as well. l hear the Americans
are very poor shots.

2108
02:49:56,835 --> 02:49:59,590
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l must write a letter.

2109
02:50:10,183 --> 02:50:12,935
For the rest of my life,
Herr Reichsmarschall...

2110
02:50:13,309 --> 02:50:15,853
...people will ask me what
your final thoughts were.

2111
02:50:16,063 --> 02:50:17,855
l'll have nothing to tell them.

2112
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:19,649
You can tell them this:

2113
02:50:20,984 --> 02:50:22,903
l say, for now and all time:

2114
02:50:23,986 --> 02:50:28,198
The foreigners who have imposed
this sentence upon me may murder me...

2115
02:50:28,324 --> 02:50:30,952
...but they have no right to judge me.

2116
02:50:31,534 --> 02:50:33,495
That l deny them.

2117
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:40,002
Now, you must excuse me,
l do have to write this letter. Thank you.

2118
02:50:48,343 --> 02:50:50,429
My one and only sweetheart.

2119
02:50:50,762 --> 02:50:54,391
My life came to an end
when l bade you farewell for the last time.

2120
02:50:55,183 --> 02:50:57,060
Do not grieve, my dearest one.

2121
02:50:57,477 --> 02:51:02,356
Since then l have felt at peace with myself,
and consider my death a deliverance.

2122
02:51:03,566 --> 02:51:07,277
All my thoughts are with you
and our own dear, sweet child.

2123
02:51:08,361 --> 02:51:12,240
My last heartbeats,
of our great and eternal love.

2124
02:52:05,457 --> 02:52:06,959
Colonel, may l?

2125
02:52:10,711 --> 02:52:12,755
- You got what you want?
- l got it, sir.

2126
02:52:12,963 --> 02:52:14,798
Gentlemen, follow me.

2127
02:52:44,284 --> 02:52:45,452
Mein Gott.

2128
02:52:46,913 --> 02:52:48,331
Get dressed.

2129
02:53:12,853 --> 02:53:14,313
Get a doctor!

2130
02:53:15,981 --> 02:53:17,859
Somebody get a doctor!

2131
02:53:54,058 --> 02:53:55,268
Cyanide.

2132
02:54:19,583 --> 02:54:21,210
Son of a bitch.

2133
02:54:52,781 --> 02:54:56,284
- State your name.
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.

2134
02:54:56,743 --> 02:54:58,620
Do you have anything to say?

2135
02:54:58,827 --> 02:55:02,247
My last wish is that Germany
realize its destiny.

2136
02:55:02,998 --> 02:55:05,041
l wish peace to the world.

2137
02:55:24,144 --> 02:55:27,773
- Do you have anything to say?
- l now join my sons.

2138
02:55:28,731 --> 02:55:31,191
Deutschland uber alles!

2139
02:55:53,086 --> 02:55:54,212
Three.

2140
02:56:00,136 --> 02:56:02,138
l'm dying an innocent man.

2141
02:56:07,518 --> 02:56:10,271
l ask God to accept me with my sin.

2142
02:56:14,566 --> 02:56:15,525
Heil Hitler!

2143
02:56:15,649 --> 02:56:16,525
Heil Hitler!

2144
02:56:26,326 --> 02:56:27,327
Seven.

2145
02:56:55,186 --> 02:56:56,896
All cleaned out. Everything.

2146
02:56:57,605 --> 02:57:01,652
The cells are to be scrubbed clean.
Nothing's to be left.

2147
02:57:05,155 --> 02:57:06,489
Nothing.

2148
02:57:10,786 --> 02:57:11,995
Danke schon.

2149
02:57:13,746 --> 02:57:14,706
Thanks.

2150
02:57:15,415 --> 02:57:18,501
You know, when we get home,
we've got some decisions to make.

2151
02:57:18,584 --> 02:57:21,128
Some personal decisions.

2152
02:57:22,462 --> 02:57:24,548
Let's just wait till we get home.

2153
02:57:29,927 --> 02:57:31,387
Hello, you two.

2154
02:57:32,221 --> 02:57:34,140
You know it may sound strange...

2155
02:57:34,224 --> 02:57:37,227
...but l can't help feeling
a touch sentimental about all this.

2156
02:57:37,684 --> 02:57:39,144
l understand.

2157
02:57:40,479 --> 02:57:45,317
l got a letter from a friend today
saying that because of what we've done...

2158
02:57:46,861 --> 02:57:48,780
...none of it can ever happen again.

2159
02:57:50,281 --> 02:57:51,532
What do you think?

2160
02:57:52,783 --> 02:57:54,409
Well...

2161
02:57:56,537 --> 02:57:57,829
We can hope, can't we?

2162
02:58:03,167 --> 02:58:04,252
'Bye.
