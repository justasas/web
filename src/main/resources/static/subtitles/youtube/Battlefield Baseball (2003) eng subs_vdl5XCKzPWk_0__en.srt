1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:09,942
This movie is dedicated to
all those who love baseball

2
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,556
"The Koshien Stadium Tournament. "

3
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,121
The dream of every
high school baseball player...

4
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,663
where they run
about the field furiously...

5
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:45,939
to seize a moment of honor...

6
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,640
as if their lives depended on it.

7
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:04,862
But have you heard of baseball...

8
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:09,867
where players risk their lives...

9
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:12,631
with blood, sweat and tears?

10
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,371
It's that dream again.

11
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,938
I should forget it.
It's over.

12
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,741
You hear?
The new student is really bad.

13
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,045
He keeps getting expelled.

14
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:38,317
Last time, he got expelled
on the same day he started.

15
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,882
They say
he killed a teacher.

16
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,192
No, he killed
his parents.

17
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,789
Their bodies
were torn to pieces.

18
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:52,064
Some body parts
haven't been found yet.

19
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,002
Three years in prison.

20
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:56,199
He got out of prison.

21
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,606
- No, he hasn't...
-...been caught.

22
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,269
- Wanted...
-...nationwide.

23
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,347
So I hear.

24
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,610
Four Eyes!

25
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,320
Four Eyes!

26
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,064
G-G-Gori...

27
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,133
M-M-Matsui...

28
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:59,232
What are you doing?

29
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:03,139
Why couldn't
you catch that?

30
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,210
S-s-sorry.

31
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,248
Go for it.

32
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,909
- Koshien Stadium.
- Right.

33
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,722
Baseball's tough.

34
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,682
What was that?

35
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:07,832
BATTLEFIELD BASEBALL

36
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,076
Matsui Gorilla.

37
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:16,875
We have nothing to worry about,
as Iong as we have him.

38
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,417
Not just him.

39
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,579
Chikuwabu
can pitch 90 mph.

40
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,920
Itaro has a
.600 batting average.

41
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,394
Hayami steals bases
99% of the time.

42
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,635
I, Nantaro Asakura,
principal of Seido High,

43
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,235
now declare that...

44
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:51,339
Seido High
will make it...

45
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,443
to the Koshien Tournament
this year!

46
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,088
Principal Kocho!

47
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,163
Head Teacher,
what has happened?

48
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:06,822
We know the opponent
for the first game!

49
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,560
Oh, yeah? Who?

50
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,536
We have nothing to fear
with Matsui Gorilla.

51
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,605
But...

52
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,876
it's Gedo High School.

53
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,409
What!?

54
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,379
That can't be true.

55
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:28,442
They haven't competed
in years!

56
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:30,544
That must be wrong!

57
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,716
But...
Iook at this!

58
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,761
GEDO HIGH VICTORY IN USA

59
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,792
It's all over.

60
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,401
This summer...
it's over.

61
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,477
Everything is-

62
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,494
It's gone!

63
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,403
Gori, Gori!

64
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,995
Four Eyes!

65
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,100
Don't just stand there!
Go get it!

66
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,202
Yes!

67
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:47,995
I forgot,
this is the dropouts' hideout.

68
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,723
- Who the hell are you?
- Sorry, sorry.

69
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,792
Don't "sorry" me!

70
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,361
Did you see a ball?

71
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,228
What?
A ball?

72
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,430
You came to get it?

73
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,098
- Do you know where it is?
- What do you think?

74
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,115
That ball...

75
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:43,211
hit my teeth
and busted them.

76
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,414
How can I
pay you back?

77
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:52,290
Pay me $1,000 for damages,
asshole!

78
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,365
No, one million!

79
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,465
Bring me one billion!

80
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,233
I'm waiting!

81
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,307
Shut the fuck up!

82
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,638
I hate bullying!

83
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,086
Shit!

84
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,586
I can't even take
a nap...

85
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,150
without Iistening
to your fucking story.

86
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,058
Story? It wasn't true?

87
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:28,655
Shut up!
Do you know what you're saying?

88
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,805
I don't care
who the hell you are.

89
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,105
But you'II regret
fucking with us, because...

90
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,009
I don't care!

91
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,193
Stop!

92
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,713
It's the Bancho.

93
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,752
You're the new student.

94
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:25,312
Thanks for
taking care of my man.

95
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:29,019
I have to give you
something in return.

96
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,466
Guys, it's showtime.

97
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,543
It shall be done.

98
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,638
That's just
what I want!

99
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,240
I need it.

100
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,096
Incredible,
he's as ferocious as they say.

101
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,663
But he's not
just a punk.

102
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,741
I know it.

103
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:25,110
I don't need this.
I don't care.

104
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:35,591
Wait, we can sit
this year out.

105
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,061
We can go
for it next year.

106
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,621
We don't really need
to take on Gedo.

107
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:47,067
Principal Kocho!
There's trouble!

108
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,903
What happened?

109
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,942
Some punks are fighting!

110
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,011
Fighting?

111
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,843
They do that all the time.
Leave them alone.

112
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:01,544
But one of our players is
in the fight...

113
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:06,591
and if people find out,
the team will be suspended.

114
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,354
We won't be able
to play anymore.

115
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,326
What?!

116
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,729
Everyone's standing
in the way of my dream.

117
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,802
I won't Iet them!

118
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,278
It shall be done-

119
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,367
This is gonna be fun.

120
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:02,006
Tell me your name.

121
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,550
Baseball.

122
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,712
Jubeh the Baseball!

123
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,791
Baseball!

124
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,759
That's the word
I hate the most.

125
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,328
So what?

126
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:22,298
What I hate the most
is baseball!

127
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,270
Well, Jubeh,
this will be your Iast game.

128
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,740
Is that so?

129
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,316
Hey, hurry up already,
you bastards!

130
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:47,723
Scared? Want me to fight ya?
How about it?

131
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,698
Student rep, stop this!

132
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:02,466
No! This is a fight
between men.

133
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,136
The baseball team
will get in trouble!

134
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,178
But, they aren't
on the team.

135
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,408
Yeah - What?!
Head Teacher!

136
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,418
Who is he?
I've never seen him!

137
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,489
The new student
who is coming today.

138
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,716
What! He's the one?

139
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:25,559
Jubeh, you're almost
as good as they say.

140
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:29,259
Stop talking.
Let's start!

141
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,144
What are they doing?

142
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,213
PIaying baseball...

143
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:47,115
but more accurately,
"fighting baseball."

144
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,449
What!
Fighting baseball?

145
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,357
It's a strike.

146
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,831
Look,
tremendous Ieg power!

147
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,168
If he's a runner,
he could slide well.

148
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,970
A grounder to third base. It Iooks
Iike he doesn't have a chance.

149
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,009
But with his slide,

150
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:17,014
clouds of dust come up,
and the umpire calls it safe!

151
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:20,414
- Is that so.
- The second pitch.

152
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,693
Two strikes.
There's only one Ieft.

153
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,559
Did you see that,
Head Teacher?

154
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,835
- Yes.
- Great jumping power.

155
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,206
He could catch
any outfield ball.

156
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:50,009
A hit!
It's going, going, going-

157
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,481
Everyone thinks
it's a home run.

158
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:59,285
But he jumps, jumps
and jumps, and then it's out.

159
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,723
- Is that so.
- Watch them.

160
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,242
What?

161
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,349
What wonderful flexibility.

162
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,216
He's in the batter's box.
The pitcher throws.

163
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,257
It's about to hit him,
but he avoids it.

164
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,288
The ball approaches.
He Ieans and Iets it pass.

165
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:46,236
It will be amazing
if he joins the baseball team.

166
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:48,897
We might be able
to beat Gedo.

167
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,942
SCHOOL TRANSFER NOTICE

168
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,951
Goodbye.

169
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:42,527
I can't Iet him go!

170
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,538
Wait, please wait!

171
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,037
Who are you?

172
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,631
I'm the principal
of Seido High...

173
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:02,406
and head coach
of the baseball team.

174
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:06,472
I don't care
about suspension or expulsion.

175
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,553
It's not that.

176
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:12,420
I saw your fantastic plays.

177
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:15,890
I've never seen such skill.
I'm impressed!

178
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,961
Impressed?

179
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,759
PIease join
our baseball team...

180
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,268
and take me
to Koshien Stadium!

181
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,296
Koshien Stadium?

182
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,199
Why are you
telling me that?

183
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,608
Tell your team that!

184
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,918
That won't work.

185
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,509
They're no match
for Gedo Baseball.

186
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,455
Gedo Baseball?
What's that?

187
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,489
Gedo Baseball
is baseball...

188
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,190
with no rules,
and it's outside the Iaw.

189
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,267
No rules!?

190
00:18:56,367 --> 00:19:01,270
Police can't do anything
about what happens.

191
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,240
I'll never forget
when we played them.

192
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,779
The scum had free reign,
and we got pummeled.

193
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:15,384
For them, Koshien's
a playground to kill Iegally.

194
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:21,250
I didn't know
there was such scum.

195
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,327
You couldn't help it.

196
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,886
Even baseball freaks
Iike me didn't know...

197
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,129
until we actually
had a game with them.

198
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:36,064
Who are these scum?

199
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,076
They're Gedo High School!

200
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,443
Gedo High School!

201
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:47,507
PIease!
Only your fighting baseball...

202
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:50,917
can beat Gedo High.

203
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:53,513
Before we have
more victims,

204
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,751
beat them up.

205
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,097
Jubeh,
please say something!

206
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,596
It's not
my fucking business.

207
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,637
Don't say that, Jubeh.

208
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,107
If you play,
you know you can play well.

209
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:18,150
If my eyes don't fail me,
you've played baseball before!

210
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,308
Even so,

211
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,649
I'II never play again.

212
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,846
I made a vow.

213
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,653
You vowed-

214
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,786
Sorry.
I'm through with baseball.

215
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:39,267
Who is that?

216
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,703
Who are you?

217
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,933
Give me your name!

218
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,271
It's me!

219
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:49,141
So? Who-

220
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,052
Whoa, it's Bancho!

221
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,620
Yeah, that's right!

222
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:02,250
Bancho, your face
has changed!

223
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:07,958
I changed my mind.
Of course, I changed my face too.

224
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:13,265
But, are you okay?
You were badly beaten.

225
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:17,274
I'm fine.
I owe Jubeh.

226
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,811
What?
I don't understand.

227
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,403
I Ioved baseball
when I was a boy.

228
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,247
But I ruined my shoulder
and quit.

229
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:34,086
The body blows stimulated
my sore spot...

230
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,719
and cured my shoulder.

231
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,388
Jubeh cured me,

232
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,833
so I can face
my enemies again.

233
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:49,269
Is that so?
You did it, Jubeh.

234
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,342
I didn't know.

235
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:53,411
Jubeh,

236
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:57,208
play baseball with me.

237
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,978
I know that...

238
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:04,579
your heart desires
to play baseball.

239
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:11,951
Sorry, I gave up baseball
for a better reason than you.

240
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,032
'Bye.

241
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,744
That's what he said...

242
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:32,806
but he was really itching
to get a chance to play again.

243
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:35,010
Bancho's words...

244
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,351
kept going
through his head...

245
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,690
over and over.

246
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,852
I got the ball.

247
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,948
Jubeh,

248
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,288
I, too, beg you.

249
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:19,289
PIease play with us.

250
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,730
Principal Kocho
asked you to.

251
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,132
No, it's my request.

252
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,429
But...

253
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,670
I can't even stay
in this school.

254
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,678
I tore up
the school transfer notice.

255
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,280
If that's the problem,
will this suffice?

256
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:49,928
You did this?

257
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,596
You did this?

258
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,564
Yes.

259
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:04,173
Jubeh,
why'd you give up the game?

260
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:12,207
It's the story
of a boy

261
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:21,256
and baseball

262
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:28,094
The young boy
loved baseball

263
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,500
And pitched

264
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:37,836
From dawn to dusk

265
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:57,617
By the time
he entered junior high

266
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:04,965
No one could catch
his pitches

267
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:12,032
The pitcher
who threw too fast

268
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:20,413
Was hated and left alone
by everyone

269
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:29,460
To console
the poor boy

270
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:36,990
His father
played catch with him

271
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:42,005
Though he never
played ball before

272
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:49,907
With joy,
the boy pitched.

273
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:56,943
Whirling around and around,
he pitched.

274
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,436
Father died

275
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,564
The boy's pitch
was too fast

276
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:31,378
And that's
the story of a boy

277
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,886
and baseball

278
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,135
The pitch
you threw killed him?

279
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,170
Yes.

280
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:50,799
Without my knowing it,

281
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,902
my pitching
had exceeded all Iimitations.

282
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:58,140
I don't remember
how I did it.

283
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:02,709
I tried very hard
to forget...

284
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,087
and now
I don't remember it.

285
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,359
So that's what
happened to you.

286
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:15,558
After that,
I Ieft home...

287
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:19,067
and changed
schools constantly.

288
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,138
Jubeh,

289
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:25,708
you really want to play baseball,
don't you?

290
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,312
You pretend you're bad
to hide your feelings?

291
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:34,407
You don't understand!

292
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,545
- I'm the same way.
- You too?

293
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,991
My mother doesn't
Iet me play ball.

294
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:50,999
She hates baseball and will kill me
if she catches me playing.

295
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,537
So, I'm playing
behind her back.

296
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,007
We're the opposite!

297
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:02,203
Love of baseball!

298
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,008
Love of baseball...

299
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:08,575
I don't have a talent
for baseball Iike you.

300
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,918
But I have
the same feeling!

301
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,586
The same feeling...

302
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,931
Four Eyes!

303
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,699
Now I've got it!

304
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,332
I couldn't face myself.

305
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,411
I was a coward.

306
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,670
Jubeh.

307
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,771
Four Eyes.

308
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:56,461
Ten minutes later...

309
00:28:56,567 --> 00:29:02,597
Jubeh decided to join
Seido High's baseball team.

310
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,107
- Four Eyes!
- Jubeh!

311
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,178
I Iove you!
Four Eyes!

312
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,016
I'm home.

313
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,788
Didn't you hear
something?

314
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:29,092
It was
a bouncing ball.

315
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,730
Are you imagining things,
Mother?

316
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,039
Strange, there shouldn't be
any balls in our house.

317
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:46,105
You!
Do you play baseball?

318
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:52,650
Of course not!
I know how much you hate it.

319
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,555
Hmm. Okay, then.

320
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,723
If you're playing baseball,
you'II be sorry.

321
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:06,796
If you even join
a baseball team,

322
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:09,806
you're dead!

323
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:19,908
Now it's ten minutes
before the preliminary game.

324
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,116
Gorilla isn't here yet.

325
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,326
Hey, what're you doing?

326
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,265
Time to play ball!

327
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,729
PRELIMINARY GAME
BASEBALLSTADIUM, FRONT GATE

328
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,744
He's not here.

329
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,076
What happened?
The game'II start soon.

330
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,775
Jubeh isn't here yet-

331
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,250
Strange.
Something must have happened.

332
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,982
They couldn't find Jubeh...

333
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:03,185
because...

334
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:08,857
he was locked away
in prison.

335
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,202
Kocho!

336
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,675
I've heard everything
from the Head Teacher!

337
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,475
You're sidelining
us Seido High players...

338
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,075
and Ietting
amateurs play!

339
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:31,154
Gorilla!

340
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,452
Leave it to the baseball
warriors this time.

341
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,254
Baseball warriors?

342
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,160
Where are they?

343
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:44,725
Well, they aren't here yet.

344
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,804
What?

345
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,814
They got scared
and ran away.

346
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,013
I can't rely
on such cowards.

347
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,748
We'II play the game.

348
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:11,989
No, you can't win
at Gedo Baseball!

349
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,222
You'II all get killed!

350
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,857
What!?

351
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,528
Kocho,

352
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:24,039
what's our goal?

353
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,372
Go for...

354
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,503
Koshien Stadium.

355
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,208
Yes.

356
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:39,347
You're telling us to give up.
I can't Iet you do that!

357
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,018
Kocho! I'II go to the back gate
and check again.

358
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:48,293
Jubeh!

359
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:50,866
Where on earth is he?
Whoa!

360
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,037
You son of a bitch!
What are you doing?

361
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:39,878
You Seido loser!
Your poor mommy and daddy-

362
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:45,923
You're going to be
the first sacrifice.

363
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,895
Hoichi.

364
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,970
Head Coach.

365
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,874
Told you not to kill
outside the stadium.

366
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,945
I'm sorry.

367
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:15,474
Don't make me
say it again.

368
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:30,260
We apologize.

369
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:34,804
AII our players...

370
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:37,965
have very short tempers!

371
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,818
You! Don't forget!

372
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,672
Oh, finally, here we go.

373
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,878
Let's go, Gorilla!
Let's go, Gorilla!

374
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,541
Gori! I'm here!

375
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,191
What's so funny?

376
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,098
Stop talking.

377
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:44,834
Umpire,
their attitude isn't appropriate.

378
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,753
You're outta there!

379
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,121
Why? For such
a Iittle thing?

380
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,660
You used violence.

381
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,162
Please wait.

382
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,697
He's right.
Please reverse your decision.

383
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:18,867
No, I can't do that
as an umpire.

384
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,644
Reverse it now!
Hurry up, you bastard!

385
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,875
Gorilla,
you can stay on.

386
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,318
Thank you.

387
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:36,085
If you left...

388
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:42,497
I couldn't kill you legally.
Get ready, Gorilla.

389
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:52,932
Let's hear it for Gorilla!
Hooray, Gorilla!

390
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:56,501
Gorilla, you're so cool!

391
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,208
PIay ball.

392
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:02,451
Kocho!

393
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,083
Kocho!
Are you all right?

394
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,751
Yes, I'm all right.
Did you find Jubeh?

395
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,228
No, I can't find him.

396
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,322
He might've run away.

397
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,632
No! He'd never do such a thing.
Right, Bancho?

398
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:22,602
Yes!

399
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:33,572
Four Eyes!
You all right?

400
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,710
Those scary guys
just came.

401
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,282
Where are Gorilla
and the others?

402
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,259
If they play,
they'II be in danger.

403
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,463
What's that sound?
Get inside!

404
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,534
Yes!

405
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,652
Look!

406
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,492
Gorilla! Hey!

407
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,490
Can you hear me?

408
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,769
Kocho-

409
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,398
They all-
Aaargghhh!

410
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:39,514
I had no idea
they'd be so violent.

411
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:46,886
Four Eyes...
I Ieave the Seido Team to you.

412
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:52,795
I'm counting on you-

413
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:57,400
Matsui!

414
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,599
Go for...

415
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,802
Koshien Stadium.

416
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,085
Gorilla!

417
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,527
What a moving scene.

418
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,619
Bravo!

419
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,858
Look what you've done!

420
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:35,631
Don't accuse us
of something we didn't do.

421
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:39,971
You make it sound
Iike we killed them.

422
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,204
Didn't you?

423
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:46,750
We just played baseball.

424
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,182
They died on their own.

425
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,277
Damn you!

426
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,620
This would not have happened
if it was a normal game!

427
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:59,525
No, it would have.
Right, umpire?

428
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:02,927
Yes, you're right.

429
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:10,201
That's not true!
How did nine players die?

430
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:14,471
Gedo played as usual.
They never broke the rules.

431
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:17,547
Be reasonable, Seido.

432
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:23,518
If we cheated,
we wouldn't be here.

433
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,918
We'd have been removed
from the game.

434
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,490
Damn you!

435
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,185
Your fault for sending in
such spineless players.

436
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,329
Kocho, it's no use
to say anything!

437
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:45,842
He's at the beck and call of Gedo.
Hey, you!

438
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,604
Wait, Bancho!

439
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,544
I understand.
I want revenge, too.

440
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:56,608
But, we have no chance
against these guys.

441
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,880
Right.

442
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:03,255
As principal,
I have to protect everyone.

443
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,923
Umpire!

444
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:10,497
We give up.

445
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,501
What? I can't hear you.

446
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:17,733
Seido High is
forfeiting the game!

447
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,070
Overruled!

448
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:20,699
Damn!
Just as I thought!

449
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,546
AII right! Change!

450
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,081
Yes. Change!

451
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:27,844
It's a change.

452
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:33,921
There's been
a change of players.

453
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,788
Let's go, Seido!
Let's go, Seido!

454
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:40,021
Here we go again.

455
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:44,990
Sorry, I'm powerless.

456
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:47,730
It's not your fault.

457
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,604
We'II hold them...

458
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:56,202
until Jubeh comes.

459
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,610
AII right!
Let's do it!

460
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,547
Yes!

461
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,452
I'II also play.

462
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:07,121
Head Teacher!

463
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,988
I've been Head Teacher
for 25 years!

464
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,326
I'm always ready
to sacrifice myself for Seido!

465
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,922
That's so, thank you.

466
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:22,665
Kocho, me too.

467
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:28,635
Don't try too hard.
You hide yourself here.

468
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,043
Kocho-

469
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,905
This isn't baseball!

470
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,949
Help us, Jubeh!

471
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,680
Jubeh!

472
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,015
Ten minutes before,

473
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:19,993
Jubeh succeeded in escaping
from prison as planned.

474
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,961
What is this?

475
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,546
Bancho! Bancho!

476
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,586
Jubeh.

477
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,418
You're too Iate.

478
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:52,393
Gedo was tougher
than we expected.

479
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,695
Bancho! Bancho!

480
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,202
Jubeh.

481
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,503
Kocho?

482
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:12,445
Kocho!

483
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,818
It was foolish of me...

484
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,517
to take on Gedo.

485
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:28,623
It's my fault.
Because of me, everyone was-

486
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:31,929
Four Eyes!
What happened to him?

487
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,833
Four Eyes-

488
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:41,134
Four Eyes!
Four Eyes, Four Eyes.

489
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,550
Something's stuck
through you.

490
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,655
Jubeh!

491
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,987
You finally came, Jubeh.

492
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,161
Damn!

493
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:11,298
Whoa!

494
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,477
Jubeh!

495
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,659
Dad.

496
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:43,538
Jubeh, it's too early
for you to be here.

497
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,139
Where am I?

498
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:53,240
Go back.
And throw that magic pitch.

499
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:57,719
Magic pitch?
Wait a sec!

500
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,549
It happened accidentally.

501
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:02,452
Go back.

502
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:07,891
But I swore
I would never pitch again.

503
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:13,603
People need
that magic pitch.

504
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,003
Do it for them,
not for yourself.

505
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:18,802
But-

506
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,309
It killed me,
but I'm asking you!

507
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,612
Dad, wait!

508
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,447
How can I, Dad?

509
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:31,952
I don't remember
how I did it!

510
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:35,922
You can do it,
but don't forget...

511
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:37,960
you're not alone.

512
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:43,431
Dad! Wait! Dad!

513
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:15,958
Principal Kocho,
Jubeh is here.

514
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,835
Jubeh, he's been Iike this
since we Iost the game.

515
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:33,778
Kocho? Jubeh's here!
He came back alive!

516
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,579
Jubeh?

517
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:43,458
I've heard
that name before.

518
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:46,585
Kocho,
don't act senile.

519
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,928
Student rep,
show him!

520
00:47:50,032 --> 00:47:53,934
GEDO HIGH VICTORIOUS.
MAJORS NEXT?

521
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,304
Kocho,
won't you do anything?

522
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,146
Jubeh,

523
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,516
what can you do?

524
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:15,023
It was a total defeat.
That's reality.

525
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,786
Even you
were powerless.

526
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,920
Is that
what you really wanted?

527
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,931
What happened
to your spirit?

528
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,695
You Iose one time,
so you're giving up?

529
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:29,202
But Jubeh,
the Tournament-

530
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,967
That has nothing
to do with it!

531
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,942
We'II hit them!

532
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,605
This is war!

533
00:48:37,713 --> 00:48:39,875
War...

534
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:45,443
If they enter the Majors,
there'II be more victims!

535
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,782
If we Ieave them,

536
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:52,452
Gedo will conquer Japan,
and the world too.

537
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,959
It's not just our problem.

538
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:03,096
These are the players
who got thrashed by Gedo.

539
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,800
PIease, Seido,

540
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:11,778
fight them so there are
no more victims Iike us.

541
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:18,518
AII right!
We'II do it!

542
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:20,556
For them too!

543
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:26,125
But Jubeh,
can we win?

544
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:29,891
Yes! With the deadly bullet pitch,
we can win!

545
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,902
The ball! The deadly bullet
that killed my dad!

546
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,838
What! You were hiding
a pitch Iike that?

547
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,807
No, I just don't remember...

548
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,608
but my dad told me to throw it,
when I was dead ten minutes ago.

549
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,376
Really.

550
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:50,579
Let's start. Kocho,
help us and Four Eyes!

551
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:51,949
Actually,

552
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,621
Four Eyes
can't play anymore.

553
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:03,893
What?

554
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,935
You played baseball
without telling me.

555
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,976
You disobeyed me.

556
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:18,635
Mother, what are you
going to do to me?

557
00:50:18,748 --> 00:50:21,114
Anything I want!

558
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:23,742
As a punishment
for not Iistening,

559
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:27,186
you'II Iive forever
in this cage.

560
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:30,315
Or,

561
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,056
you'II wait
for the help...

562
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:38,225
of a savior,
for instance...

563
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:44,273
with Iong hair
and a dirty uniform.

564
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,509
Four Eyes!
Are you okay?

565
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,375
Jubeh.

566
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,780
Who are you?
Coming in Iike that!

567
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,876
His teammate!

568
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,478
What?

569
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:05,549
You're the one
who got him into baseball!

570
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:09,097
Jubeh called me a teammate.

571
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,793
Listen here,
you old bat!

572
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:17,906
I won't Iet you keep him
from playing baseball.

573
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:23,343
I'II never Iet him hit
another baseball while I'm alive.

574
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,577
Whoa!

575
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,454
- You're dead!
- OId bat!

576
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:53,260
Jubeh special!

577
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:58,539
Jubeh!

578
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,385
You're right.
She is your mother after all.

579
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:21,119
You beat me. You are good, boy.

580
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,631
You, too, old girl.

581
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,758
But tell me one thing.

582
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:29,833
Why do you hate baseball?

583
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:36,339
I want to know too! Why, Mother?

584
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:38,743
AII right.

585
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:43,784
I didn't tell you,
but there was a sad accident.

586
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,184
An accident?

587
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:50,623
Long ago I was
with my dear husband,

588
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:53,752
named Hirohi,
and our two sons.

589
00:53:56,498 --> 00:54:01,163
The oldest son
Ioved baseball.

590
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,240
Hiroshi played catch
with him.

591
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,110
But, my son's pitch...

592
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:13,614
accidentally killed Hiroshi.

593
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:21,217
He was traumatized
and went missing.

594
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:27,284
Since then,
I've hated baseball.

595
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,726
Is it me!?

596
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:35,736
What? Then, you're...

597
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:40,366
my missing son,
Jubeh?

598
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:44,344
This means
Jubeh's my brother!

599
00:54:50,586 --> 00:54:52,612
Ah, it's true.

600
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,616
Who is this?

601
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:57,852
Don't tease.
It's me.

602
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,123
I was cute
when I was young.

603
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,701
Mommy!

604
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:11,373
Mother!

605
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,602
I'II never Iet you go.

606
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,373
Because of me-
It's my fault that Dad-

607
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:23,483
Jubeh's my brother!
Jubeh!

608
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:30,617
My Four Eyes!
You can play ball.

609
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,061
Yeah!

610
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:01,423
His pitch killed Hiroshi.

611
00:56:01,423 --> 00:56:10,367
His pitch killed Hiroshi.

612
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:16,829
The boy was admired
by his father

613
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:25,244
With joy the boy whirled
around and around

614
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:42,724
He spun around
and pitched

615
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:51,432
The ball gained speed
and went right through his father

616
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:56,478
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Spin around!

617
00:56:56,478 --> 00:57:06,054
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Spin around!

618
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:08,215
Oh, that windup!

619
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,452
That's Thal's Nomo's
major Ieague pitch.

620
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,564
He's winding up!

621
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:20,159
It's no mere Tornado Pitch!

622
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:26,731
Yes! Let's call it
the Super Tornado Pitch!

623
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:28,241
I just named it!

624
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,278
Super Tornado!

625
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,885
Mama!

626
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:56,062
Oh, no!
The ball will-

627
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,909
Who are you?
Who stopped my Super Tornado?

628
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:11,652
Who are you?
Tell me your name!

629
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,515
It's me!

630
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:16,921
So, who...

631
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,191
Whoa! Bancho!

632
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,423
That's right!

633
00:58:23,532 --> 00:58:26,933
You're alive!

634
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,731
And his face
has changed again.

635
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:32,034
I died, all right.

636
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,938
But I've been
reborn again.

637
00:58:35,043 --> 00:58:38,638
Of course,
my face has changed too!

638
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,909
You've been
reborn again?

639
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:44,975
I heard everything
while I was dead.

640
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,649
It's now time
to get even with Gedo!

641
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,955
Okay, we've both died once.
Let's do it!

642
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,092
Yes!

643
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,296
How nice
to see this again!

644
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,262
What is this?

645
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:08,366
Ah, I got it
in the other world.

646
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,070
Other world.

647
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:15,081
A stranger stopped me and said
it was too early to die.

648
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,118
He gave this to me.

649
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,347
This is the super mitt
my dad was using!

650
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,393
This can catch
my Super Tornado.

651
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:28,692
So it was
your father, right?

652
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:31,425
GOOD LUCK, JUBEH
FROM DAD

653
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:38,201
Dad!
I'II do my best!

654
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:41,643
This is Gedo High,
a paradise with flowers and greenery.

655
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:50,552
This is Gedo High,
a paradise with flowers and greenery.

656
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:53,043
They were easy,
weren't they?

657
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:56,148
We wanna fight
someone tougher.

658
00:59:56,259 --> 01:00:00,592
Someone who is
tough enough...

659
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,963
to attack
our invincible Hell Island.

660
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:08,463
Who is that!

661
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:13,866
What?
I thought you were dead!

662
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:17,878
I was!
But I came back to Iife.

663
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:20,745
To send you
to the real Hell!

664
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:24,842
Shut up! It makes no difference
if you've come back!

665
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,251
He could be right.

666
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:34,127
Let's go, Jubeh!
Let's go!

667
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:38,632
Let's go, Jubeh! Let's go!

668
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,967
Go, go! Hey!
Hope you both die!

669
01:00:47,175 --> 01:00:49,110
PIay ball.

670
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,461
There's only one enemy!
Finish him!

671
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,291
Not just one!

672
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,067
You!

673
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,375
We're five!

674
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:27,037
Still only five!
Poor you.

675
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,345
With no strong help!

676
01:01:30,552 --> 01:01:32,452
I'm here, too.

677
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,025
Gorilla! You're alive!

678
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,930
Thanks
to advanced technology.

679
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:48,264
I'm a robo Gorilla!

680
01:01:54,409 --> 01:01:56,172
There are six of us!

681
01:01:56,278 --> 01:01:58,576
I'm here, too!

682
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:06,250
Head Teacher!
You're alive!

683
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:11,884
Yes! I've returned as a cyborg
thanks to advanced technology.

684
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:18,228
There are seven of us!

685
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,164
I'II fight, too!

686
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,008
What?
Who are you?

687
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,305
I'm Chabane.

688
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:32,869
Go! Go! Chabane.

689
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,984
There are eight of us!

690
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:39,349
Four Eyes. I'm here, too.

691
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:46,592
We're nine!

692
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:50,860
Here we are,
the nine Seido players!

693
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,806
You're wasting my time!

694
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,068
Your numbers don't matter!

695
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:04,442
These are the rules
of Battlefield Stadium.

696
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:30,961
There are no rules.

697
01:03:31,072 --> 01:03:33,632
Just kill each other!

698
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:39,647
Fight.

699
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,780
Kill them!

700
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,755
Gedo, 6 points!

701
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,954
Okay, I got it!
Everyone, get ready!

702
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:00,835
Seido, 3 points!

703
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,542
Two points.

704
01:04:17,485 --> 01:04:19,681
Seido, 7 points!

705
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:28,262
Excuse me.

706
01:04:34,302 --> 01:04:37,135
Gedo, 1 2...

707
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:39,207
1 4 points!

708
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,951
Are you okay?

709
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:57,748
Hey, I'II kill you!

710
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,899
Chabane, Chabane!

711
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:56,516
- Chabane!
- Gorilla!

712
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:09,564
- Gorilla!
- Chabane!

713
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:12,963
Go! Go! Chabane!
Go! Go! Chabane!

714
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:18,529
Fight, you bastards!
Kill each other! Ha!

715
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:27,208
Ah, they're flying!

716
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:45,126
It's tied.

717
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:45,567
Bullshit! I'm pissed!

718
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,571
Bullshit! I'm pissed!

719
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,697
I'II kill you!

720
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:56,177
For the sake
of all future baseball players...

721
01:06:56,277 --> 01:06:59,576
I'II kill you!

722
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:05,051
Get ready!

723
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,180
Die, asshole!

724
01:07:17,365 --> 01:07:19,527
Jubeh's is number 1.

725
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,162
The Gedo coach is
on his own.

726
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,900
one on one.

727
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,038
It means...

728
01:07:29,144 --> 01:07:32,204
this battle will
decide the winner!

729
01:07:58,039 --> 01:07:59,166
Kocho!

730
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,860
Jubeh!

731
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:36,944
I'II finish you!

732
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:40,810
Jubeh!

733
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:02,603
Jubeh.

734
01:09:05,306 --> 01:09:07,467
You're really hurt.

735
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,100
You fought for us.

736
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:17,510
He's not human.

737
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:21,222
Jubeh.

738
01:09:21,222 --> 01:09:21,422
Jubeh.

739
01:09:21,422 --> 01:09:27,827
Jubeh, you fought well.
I'm impressed!

740
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,025
You're the first one
to give me a good fight.

741
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:37,002
To show my gratitude,
Iet me unveil a new bat to you.

742
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:39,539
I completed it Iast night.

743
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:42,769
Mechanic!
Bring it here!

744
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:44,970
Yes!

745
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,083
Ha ha, this is it.

746
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,085
This is brand new!

747
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,336
Whoa!

748
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,908
Whoa!

749
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:52,173
This is Gedo High's new weapon,
the poisoned bat named "Poison Bat."

750
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,838
Whoa!

751
01:10:53,948 --> 01:11:00,717
It has poisons in it
from all over the world.

752
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:06,762
And there are many different
kinds of medicinal herbs, too.

753
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:11,265
What do you think will happen?
You won't die!

754
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:17,168
The pain is
completely unbearable.

755
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:21,403
But you can't die
for 1 00 years!

756
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,875
For 1 00 years.

757
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,572
- A Iiving hell.
- That's right!

758
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,310
Gedo's science team developed it
with their expertise.

759
01:11:30,418 --> 01:11:35,823
It was hard
to perfectly balance the mixture.

760
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:48,662
Ah? It doesn't hurt.

761
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,262
What! Why is that?

762
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:57,210
The kid!
I didn't know!

763
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,304
Four Eyes!

764
01:11:59,414 --> 01:12:01,177
Jubeh.

765
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:06,983
I helped you, didn't I?

766
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:10,514
My brother!

767
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,217
Don't worry about me.

768
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:22,895
Live your Iife...

769
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:32,368
Shit! The kid interfered!

770
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:38,385
This poison was specially
created to kill the hero.

771
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:41,114
Shit, I can't take it!

772
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:44,920
How dare you kill...

773
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,489
my brother...

774
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:53,599
I'II send you...

775
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,505
to hell!

776
01:12:57,605 --> 01:12:59,664
The Jubeh...

777
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:06,010
Special!

778
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,479
Nice ball.

779
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:21,923
Son of a bitch!
My Gedo baseball team...

780
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:28,501
was defeated
by just one student...

781
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,936
with Iong hair
and a dirty uniform.

782
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:34,337
Just one student?

783
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:38,880
You still don't understand
why you were defeated?

784
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:46,550
You never will because
you treat your players Iike shit.

785
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:49,885
Shut up!
What's wrong with that?

786
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:56,261
In baseball,
you can never win on your own!

787
01:13:56,364 --> 01:14:02,166
The most important thing is
the teamwork, the friendship!

788
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:07,037
Friendship gave me power!

789
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:12,478
You Iost 'cause you got drunk on
victory and never valued friendship.

790
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,344
Idiot!

791
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,287
Friendship...

792
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,289
Effort...

793
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,292
Victory...

794
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:33,260
I've Iost.
Completely.

795
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:37,604
Kill me.

796
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:42,369
Pay for your sins
in Hell.

797
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,445
You fucker!

798
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,081
Wait, please!

799
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,181
Wait, please!

800
01:14:47,181 --> 01:14:49,149
What the hell-

801
01:14:50,918 --> 01:14:54,581
Don't kill our coach!

802
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:58,854
Why are you
defending him?

803
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,953
He treated you Iike shit.

804
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,123
Even so,

805
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,829
we were happy!

806
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,960
You idiots.

807
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:13,701
We were abandoned
before we met the coach.

808
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,470
Abandoned?

809
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:18,909
We were abandoned
by our mothers...

810
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,109
and sent
from one orphanage to another.

811
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:28,782
We'd never been used
for anything!

812
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:37,356
At Ieast he used us!

813
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:41,425
He had us work
as his slaves!

814
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:54,139
So, please save his Iife!

815
01:15:57,118 --> 01:16:00,349
We're his fans.

816
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,964
Okay, I'II Iet you go.

817
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:25,404
You all-

818
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:45,195
Jubeh, thank you.

819
01:16:47,802 --> 01:16:49,963
I was wrong.

820
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,734
Goodbye.

821
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:58,479
Jubeh!

822
01:17:04,685 --> 01:17:06,880
ANTIDOTE FOR FOUR EYES

823
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,007
What have you done?

824
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:32,773
One should never betray
one's companions!

825
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:35,782
I'll take the coach's place!

826
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:45,356
I'll die believing
that friendship is useless.

827
01:18:13,721 --> 01:18:18,420
You've got it
all wrong.

828
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:24,860
I've never felt anger
Iike this!

829
01:18:27,435 --> 01:18:30,734
Shut up, asshole!
The game is over!

830
01:18:39,613 --> 01:18:42,514
Sayonara!

831
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,800
Chiyotato, Chietaro.

832
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:06,061
I told you not to come.

833
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:12,847
Kocho, is this
the reward for victory?

834
01:19:12,847 --> 01:19:18,153
Kocho, is this
the reward for victory?

835
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:23,784
Many innocent people died
because of us.

836
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,127
I killed them!

837
01:19:38,539 --> 01:19:40,097
Because I...

838
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:43,838
played baseball,

839
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:47,038
they Iost
their precious Iives!

840
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,750
Jubeh...

841
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:54,208
It's a miracle!

842
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:57,682
Jubeh's tear
made it happen!

843
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:51,765
Game over!
Jubeh is the winner!

844
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:02,713
Everybody Iisten!

845
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,717
Let's toss Principal Kocho!

846
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,364
The toss up.

847
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:26,338
An honor reserved
only for victors...

848
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:30,240
and what
all players long for.

849
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,143
Principal Kocho
was overcome with joy...

850
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:39,482
as the players kept tossing him
as long as they could.

851
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:42,647
And they knew...

852
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:48,126
that the love of baseball
goes beyond good and evil.

853
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,324
But they didn 't know...

854
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:57,029
this man watching
the game died...

855
01:22:57,137 --> 01:22:59,698
1 0 minutes earlier.

856
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:03,641
He died of alcoholism.

857
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:07,545
His name was
Taizo Nakamura.

858
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,380
He was my master.

859
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:16,787
Take a look
at the smile on his face.

860
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:21,589
Do you think
you could die as happy?
