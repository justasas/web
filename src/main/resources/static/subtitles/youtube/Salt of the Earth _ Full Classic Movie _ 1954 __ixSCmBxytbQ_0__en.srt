306
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,889
company said till them and return to

307
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:31,710
their jobs at the back to work movement

308
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:33,750
didn't work and so the company recruited

309
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:41,640
a few strikebreakers from out of town

310
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:44,069
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they usually lost their nerve and</font>

311
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:52,170
they saw the size of the picket line a

312
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:54,089
shirtless men were always there they

313
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:58,560
stood around showing off their weapons

314
00:25:54,089 --> 00:26:04,199
but the men only marched day after day

315
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:05,909
week after week at first it was an

316
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,210
unwritten rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the women stay at</font>

317
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,430
home the Union gave us rations and we

318
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,730
had to figure out how to feed our

319
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:18,000
families on them but then one morning

320
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,069
mrs. Alice I went to the picket line her

321
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,329
husband<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been killed in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a strike many</font>

322
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:28,189
years before and she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there</font>

323
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:30,679
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> remembers just how it happened</font>

324
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">but one day mrs. Salazar started</font>

325
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,190
marching with them and she kept on

326
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,189
marching with them

327
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,840
after a while some of the women began to

328
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,600
bring coffee for their husbands and

329
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:52,069
maybe a couple of tacos because<font color="#CCCCCC"> a man</font>

330
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:53,689
