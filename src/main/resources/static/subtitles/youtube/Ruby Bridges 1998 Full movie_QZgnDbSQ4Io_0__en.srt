01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:38,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">that yes gumbo looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great mmm try and</font>

833
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:40,829
so I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a family</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> child</font>

834
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:42,900
under great stress and fear could show

835
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:44,760
exquisite dignity and courage because of

836
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:47,159
their moral and religious values and

837
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,980
because they had a definite purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

838
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:51,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accomplish this</font>

839
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:53,699
purpose made them resilient I couldn't

840
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out the source of this resilience</font>

841
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:57,539
because I only worked with well-to-do

842
01:15:55,829 --> 01:15:59,369
children who really had nothing to work

843
01:15:57,539 --> 01:16:01,619
hard for no reason driving them to

844
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:04,710
accomplish anything so now I see that

845
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:07,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">the issue is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stressed but stress for</font>

846
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:09,390
what purpose having something to believe

847
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:11,909
in protected<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ruby from psychiatric</font>

848
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:18,420
symptoms and gave her a dignity and

849
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:22,109
strength<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is utterly remarkable so</font>

850
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:25,289
all we could do was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sip since she is</font>

851
01:16:22,109 --> 01:16:29,429

01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:29,590
what I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why I'm lowering</font>

927
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:39,500
them to more accurately reflect a true

928
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:41,360
assessment of her ability what

929
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,710
well she's been privately tutored the

930
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:45,139
whole year through which makes your

931
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:46,579
schoolers inaccurate she's had special

932
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:52,760
attention the other children just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

933
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:54,199
not have that's what this is you're

934
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,020
upset<font color="#CCCCCC"> because she did better than the</font>

938
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:07,939
principal I already have she did the

939
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:11,420
work by herself so the scores are

940
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:13,789
accurate the only reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was</font>

941
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:15,800
privately taught is because you would

942
01:24:13,789 --> 01:24:18,859
not put her with other children to mix

943
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,560
