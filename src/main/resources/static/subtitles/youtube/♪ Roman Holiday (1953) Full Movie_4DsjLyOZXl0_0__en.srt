00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,105
Paramount News
brings you special coverage

3
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,073
of Princess Ann's visit to London.

4
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,112
The first stop on her much publicised
goodwill tour of European capitals.

5
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,079
She gets a royal welcome.

6
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:59,107
Thousands cheer a young member of
one of Europe's oldest ruling families.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,125
After three days of continuous activity
and a visit to Buckingham Palace,

8
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,091
Ann flew to Amsterdam,

9
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,129
where she dedicated
the new International Aid Building

10
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,096
and an ocean liner.

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,135
Then she went to Paris,
attending many official functions

12
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,126
to cement trade relations
between her country

13
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,130
and the Western European nations.

14
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,109
And so to Rome, the Eternal City,

15
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,141
where the princess's visit
was marked by a spectacular parade,

16
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:32,140
highlighted by the band
of the crack bersaglieri regiment.

17
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,125
The smiling young princess
showed no sign

18
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,163
of the strain of the week's
continuous public appearances.

19
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:45,683
At her country's
embassy that evening,

20
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,132
a formal reception
and ball in her honour

21
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,159
was given by her country's
ambassador to Italy.

22
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,180
Her Royal Highness.

23
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,240
His Excellency, the Papal Nuncio,
Monsignor Altomonte.

24
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,225
Sir Hugo Macey de Farmington.

25
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,765
- Good evening, Sir Hugo.
- Good evening, Your Highness.

26
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,270
His Highness, the Maharajah
of Khanipur, and the Raikuuari.

27
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:33,273
I'm so glad you could come.

28
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,262
Thank you, madam.

29
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,269
Friherre Erick af
Massinsjarna-Bergenskiold.

30
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:46,286
Prince Istvar Barlossy Nagayavaros.

31
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,277
How do you do?

32
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:56,286
Der Fürst und die Fürstin
von und zu Lucktenstichenholz.

33
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,293
Sir Hari Singh and Kmark Singh.

34
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:10,310
The Count and Countess
von Marstrand.

35
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,301
Good evening, Countess.

36
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,305
Good evening.

37
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,324
Senhor e senhora
João de Camões.

38
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,314
Good evening.

39
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,331
Hassan El Din Pasha.

40
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,323
How do you do?

41
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,431
I hate this nightgown.

42
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,413
I hate all my nightgowns,
and I hate all my underwear too.

43
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:33,452
- My dear, you have lovely things.
- But I'm not 200 years old.

44
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,456
- Why can't I sleep in pyjamas?
- Pyjamas!

45
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,447
Just the top part.

46
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,454
Did you know there are people
who sleep with absolutely nothing on?

47
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,456
I rejoice to say I did not.

48
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,459
Listen.

49
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,468
Oh, and your slippers.

50
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:09,477
Please put on your slippers
and come away from the window.

51
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,498
- Your milk and crackers.
- Everything we do is so wholesome.

52
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,465
They'll help you to sleep.

53
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,492
I'm too tired to sleep.
I shan't sleep a wink.

54
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,507
Now, my dear, if you don't mind,
tomorrow's schedule,

55
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:31,511
if that's your preferred
pronunciation, both are correct.

56
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,479
8.30, breakfast with
the embassy staff.

57
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,517
9 o'clock, leave for the
Polinari Automotive Works,

58
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,484
to be presented with a small car.

59
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,509
- Thank you.
- Which you won't accept.

60
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,488
- No, thank you.
- 10.35,

61
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,516
inspect agriculture organisation,
who'll present you with an olive tree.

62
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,519
- No, thank you.
- Which you will accept.

63
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,521
Thank you.

64
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,501
10.55, the new Foundling
Home for orphans.

65
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,540
Laying of cornerstone,
same speech as last Monday.

66
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:04,509
- Trade relations.
- Yes.

67
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:08,548
- For the orphans?
- Oh no, the other one.

68
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,550
- Youth and progress.
- Precisely.

69
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,518
11.45, back here to rest.

70
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:17,557
No, that's wrong. 11.45,
conference here with the press.

71
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,523
Sweetness and decency.

72
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,561
One o'clock sharp,
lunch with foreign ministry.

73
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:23,552
You'll wear white lace
and carry a bouquet

74
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,531
of very small pink roses.

75
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,536
- 3.05, presentation of a plaque.
- Thank you.

76
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,575
- 4.10, review special guard of police.
- No, thank you.

77
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,579
- 4.45, back here to change...
- How do you do? Charmed...

78
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,546
Stop!

79
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,572
Stop, stop!

80
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:51,591
- It's all right, dear, it didn't spill.
- I don't care if it spilled or not.

81
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:57,596
My dear, you're ill.
I'll send for Doctor Bannochhoven.

82
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,599
I don't want him.
Please let me die in peace.

83
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,615
- You're not dying.
- Leave me!

84
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,595
It's nerves. Control yourself, Ann.

85
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,101
I don't want to.

86
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,597
Your Highness!

87
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,603
- I'll get Doctor Bannochhoven.
- It's no use.

88
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,607
I'll be dead before he gets here.

89
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:32,620
- She's asleep.
- She was in hysterics 3 minutes ago.

90
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,625
- Are you asleep, ma'am?
- No.

91
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,138
I'll only disturb Your Royal
Highness a moment.

92
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:47,635
I'm very ashamed, Doctor.
Suddenly I was crying.

93
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,615
To cry is perfectly normal.

94
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,654
It's important she be calm and
relaxed for the press conference.

95
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,658
Don't worry, Doctor,
I'll be calm and relaxed.

96
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,625
I'll bow and I'll smile,

97
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,628
I'll improve trade relations and I'll...

98
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,654
There she goes again.
Give her something, please.

99
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,658
Uncover her arm, please.

100
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,639
- What's that?
- Sleep and calm.

101
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:19,678
This will relax you
and make you feel a little happy.

102
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:22,671
It's a new drug, quite harmless.

103
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,675
There.

104
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,654
I don't feel any different.

105
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,694
You will. It may take
a little time to take hold.

106
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,685
Just now, lie back.

107
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,690
- Can I keep just one light on?
- Of course.

108
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:47,706
The best thing I know is to do
exactly what you wish for a while.

109
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,697
Thank you, Doctor.

110
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,702
Oh, the General! Doctor, quick.

111
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,721
I'm perfectly all right.

112
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,712
Goodnight, ma'am.

113
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,718
- Goodnight, ma'am.
- Goodnight, Doctor.

114
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,013
- Bet five hundred.
- Five hundred. How many?

115
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,015
One.

116
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,032
- I'll take one.
- Three.

117
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,023
Four.

118
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,030
Two for Papa.

119
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,042
- 500 more.
- Without looking.

120
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:32,039
500, and I'll raise you 1,000.

121
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:44,062
- Two pairs.
- I've got three shy little sevens.

122
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:49,032
A nervous straight.
Come home, you fools.

123
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:55,064
Look at that, 6,500.
Not bad, that's ten bucks.

124
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:01,068
One more round and I'm gonna throw
you gents right out in the snow.

125
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,048
I gotta get up early.

126
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,086
A date with Her Highness, who'll
graciously pose for some pictures.

127
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:12,091
What do you mean early?
My personal invitation says 11.45.

128
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,610
Could it be because you're ahead?

129
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:17,060
- It could.
- Works out fine for me.

130
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:22,101
This is my last 5,000 and
you hyenas are not gonna get it.

131
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,104
Thanks, Irving.
See you at Ann's in the morning.

132
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,094
- Ciao, Joe.
- Stay sober.

133
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:31,098
All right, a little seven-card stud.

134
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,115
So happy.

135
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,124
How are you this evening?

136
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:01,105
Hey, hey.

137
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,131
- Wake up.
- Thank you very much.

138
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,145
- Wake up.
- No, thank you.

139
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,136
Charmed.

140
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,140
Charmed too.

141
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,147
You may sit down.

142
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,163
You'd better sit up, or you'll
get picked up by the police.

143
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,130
- Police?
- Yes.

144
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,167
2.15 and back here to change.

145
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,158
2.45...

146
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:38,177
You know, people who can't
handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

147
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:43,146
"If I were dead and buried
and I heard your voice,"

148
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:49,178
"beneath the sod my heart of dust
would still rejoice. "

149
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,180
Do you know that poem?

150
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,158
Whadda ya know?

151
00:19:55,193 --> 00:20:01,164
You're well read, well dressed,

152
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,205
snoozing away in a public street.
Would you care to make a statement?

153
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,195
What the world needs

154
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:15,204
is a return to sweetness and decency
in the souls of its young men and...

155
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,212
Yeah, I couldn't agree
with you more, but...

156
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,228
Get yourself some coffee,
you'll be all right.

157
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,251
Look, you take the cab.

158
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,261
Come on, climb in
the cab and go home.

159
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,266
- So happy.
- Got any money?

160
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,269
- Never carry money.
- That's a bad habit.

161
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,272
All right. I'll drop you off, come on.

162
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,278
- It's a taxi!
- It's not the Super Chief.

163
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,282
Where are we going?

164
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,263
- Where do you live?
- What?

165
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,289
- Colosseum.
- Come on, you're not that drunk.

166
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,271
You're so smart, I'm not drunk at all.

167
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:53,302
- I'm just being very happy.
- Hey, don't go to sleep again.

168
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,305
Where are we going?

169
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:03,310
Where do you want to go?
Where shall I take you?

170
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,315
Where do you live?

171
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,318
Come on. Where do you live?

172
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,323
Come on, where do you live?

173
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,326
Colosseum.

174
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,344
- She lives in the Colosseum.
- It's the wrong address.

175
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,312
Look, for me it is very late night.

176
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:34,343
My wife... I have three bambino,
you know bambino?

177
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,357
My taxi go home,
we go home together.

178
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:42,373
Via Margutta 51.

179
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:45,352
Via Margutta 51!

180
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,368
Here is Via Margutta 51.
I am very happy.

181
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,372
A thousand lire. Mila lire.

182
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,387
One, two, three, four mila.

183
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,392
- OK.
- For me?

184
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:30,397
OK. Now, look,
take a little bit of that.

185
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,402
Take her wherever she wants to go.

186
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,407
Goodnight.

187
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,413
Oh! No, no. Momento.

188
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:52,431
All right. Look, when she wakes up,
she'll tell you where to go.

189
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:56,423
Momento.
My taxi is not for sleep.

190
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,424
You understand?

191
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,441
Look, pal, this is not my problem.

192
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:04,432
I never see her before. OK.

193
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,412
Is not your problem,
is not my problem.

194
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:14,452
What you want?
You don't want girl, me don't want girl.

195
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,443
Police. Maybe she want girl!

196
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:21,448
Stay calm, stay calm. OK.

197
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,497
So happy.

198
00:25:04,531 --> 00:25:06,493
So happy.

199
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,519
I ought to have my head examined.

200
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,525
Is this the elevator?

201
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,528
It's my room!

202
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,534
I'm terribly sorry to mention it,
but the dizziness is getting worse.

203
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:53,546
- Can I sleep here?
- That's the general idea.

204
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,545
Can I have a silk nightgown
with rosebuds on it?

205
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,561
I'm afraid
you'll have to rough it tonight.

206
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,529
- In these.
- Pyjamas.

207
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,557
Sorry, honey, I haven't
worn a nightgown in years.

208
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,562
Will you help me
get undressed, please?

209
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,568
OK.

210
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,586
There you are.
You can handle the rest.

211
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,598
May I have some?

212
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,579
No!

213
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,583
- Now, look!
- This is very unusual.

214
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:04,611
I've never been alone with a man
before, even with my dress on.

215
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,615
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

216
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:15,622
I don't seem to mind. Do you?

217
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:22,629
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.
You'd better get to sleep.

218
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,144
Oh, no. On this one.

219
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,647
You're terribly nice.

220
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,637
Hey, come here.

221
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,655
These are pyjamas, they're
to sleep in. You're to climb into them.

222
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,644
- Understand?
- Thank you.

223
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:43,662
And you sleep on the couch. Not on
the bed, on the couch. Is that clear?

224
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:47,665
- Do you know my favourite poem?
- You've already recited it.

225
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:51,670
"Arethusa arose
From her couch of snows"

226
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:55,673
"In the Acroceraunian Mountains. "

227
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:57,641
- Keats.
- Shelley.

228
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,678
Keep your mind off the poetry
and on the pyjamas.

229
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,669
- You'll be fine.
- Keats.

230
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,684
Shelley. I'll be back
in about ten minutes.

231
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,675
Keats.

232
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:19,697
You have my permission to withdraw.

233
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,688
Thank you very much.

234
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,675
- Well?
- No trace.

235
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,712
- Did you search the grounds?
- Attics to cellar.

236
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,681
You must swear not to
speak of this to anyone.

237
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:42,219
I must remind you that the princess
is the direct heir to the throne.

238
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:46,725
This must be classified as top
crisis secret. Have I your pledge?

239
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,717
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

240
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,721
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

241
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,807
- So happy.
- The pleasure's mine.

242
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,812
Screwball!

243
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,861
Holy smoke,
the princess's interview!

244
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,876
Eleven forty-five!

245
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:19,865
Oh, sh!

246
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,889
Hi, Joe.

247
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,915
- Morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

248
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,933
Mr Hennessy has been
looking for you.

249
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,924
Uh-oh.

250
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,927
Thanks a lot, hon.

251
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,932
Come in.

252
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,918
- Looking for me?
- Just coming to work?

253
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,944
- Who, me?
- We start at 8.30 in this office.

254
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,954
- We pick up our assignments...
- I got mine last night.

255
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:44,951
- What assignment was that?
- The princess, 11.45.

256
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,969
You've already been to the interview?

257
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,959
Sure, I just got back.

258
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,964
- Well, well. All my apologies.
- It's all right.

259
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,966
- Interesting.
- No, just routine.

260
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,981
Did she answer
all the questions on the list?

261
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:07,001
Of course. I've got 'em
right here somewhere.

262
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:09,952
Don't disturb yourself,
I have a copy here.

263
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:14,993
How did Her Highness react to
the idea of a European Federation?

264
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:18,986
- She thought it was just fine.
- She did?

265
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,501
- She thought there'd be two effects.
- Two?

266
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:28,971
- The direct and the indirect.
- Remarkable.

267
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:34,999
Naturally, she thought that the indirect
would not be as direct as the direct.

268
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,510
- That is, not right away.
- No.

269
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,008
Later on, of course, nobody knows.

270
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,010
Well, well.

271
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,990
That was a shrewd observation.

272
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:52,019
They fool you, these royal kids.
They're smarter than we suspect.

273
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,024
How did she feel about
the future friendship of nations?

274
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:04,042
Youth. She felt that
the youth of the world

275
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:08,034
must lead the way to a better world.

276
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,038
Original.

277
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,042
By the way, what was she wearing?

278
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:21,059
- You mean what did she have on?
- That's usually what it means.

279
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:24,061
- Is it too warm for you?
- No, I just hurried over here.

280
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:27,030
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

281
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,034
- Did you say she was wearing grey?
- No, I didn't.

282
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:36,074
- She usually wears grey.
- Well, it was a kind of a grey.

283
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,065
I think I know the dress,
it has a gold collar...

284
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,081
That's the one. I didn't know
exactly how to describe it.

285
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:47,050
I think you described it very well,

286
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,088
in view of the fact that
she was taken violently ill at 3 AM,

287
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,079
put to bed with a high fever,

288
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,085
and has had all her appointments
for today cancelled in toto!

289
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:04,091
- In toto?
- Yes, Mr Bradley, in toto.

290
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,608
- That's pretty hard to swallow.
- In view of the fact you just left her.

291
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:16,113
Here it is, Mr Bradley, all over the
front page of every paper in Rome.

292
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,116
All right, I overslept.
It can happen to anybody.

293
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:21,108
If you ever got up
and read a morning paper,

294
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,123
you might discover little news events,
little items of general interest,

295
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,144
that might stop you getting
immersed in such a gold-plated,

296
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:34,096
triple-decked, star-spangled
lie as you have just told me.

297
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,124
If I were you I'd try some other
business, like mattress testing!

298
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,103
- Is this the princess?
- Yes, Mr Bradley.

299
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,143
It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour
or Madame Chiang Kai-Shek.

300
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:49,146
Take a good look. You might
interview her again some day.

301
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:51,113
Am I fired?

302
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:56,153
No. When I want to fire you,
you won't have to ask.

303
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,143
You'll know you're fired.

304
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,148
The man's mad.

305
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,187
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

306
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:31,153
Now listen carefully.

307
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:35,181
Hurry up to my place and see
if there's somebody there, asleep.

308
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,692
Aha. Si, Mr Joe.

309
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:43,190
I look, you wait.

310
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,214
- Mr Joe?
- Yeah. Tell me.

311
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:14,231
Giovanni, I love you! Now listen.

312
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,222
Yes, Mr Joe.

313
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,202
A gun? No.

314
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:23,205
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything.

315
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,233
But nobody goes in
and nobody goes out.

316
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,237
OK.

317
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,228
You still here?

318
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,253
What would a real interview
with this dame be worth?

319
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,269
- Are you referring to Her Highness?
- I'm not referring to Annie Oakley...

320
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,236
- How much?
- What do you care?

321
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,264
- You've got no chance...
- If I did, how much?

322
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:02,279
Just a plain talk on world
conditions might be worth 250.

323
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:05,282
Her views on clothes, a lot more.

324
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,250
- Maybe 1,000.
- Dollars?

325
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:11,282
I'm talking about
her views on everything.

326
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:15,282
The private and secret
longings of a princess.

327
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:19,286
Her innermost thoughts, as revealed
to your own correspondent,

328
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:26,293
in a private, personal,
exclusive interview.

329
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:36,302
Can't use it, huh?
I didn't think you'd like it.

330
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,306
Come here.

331
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,324
- Love angle too, I suppose?
- Practically all love angle.

332
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,290
With pictures?

333
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,293
Could be. How much?

334
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:54,331
That particular story would be worth
five grand to any news service.

335
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,300
But tell me, Mr Bradley,
if you are sober,

336
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,838
how you are going to
obtain this fantastic interview.

337
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:04,604
I'll enter her sick room
disguised as a thermometer.

338
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,335
You said five grand?
I want you to shake on that.

339
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:14,351
You realise she's in bed
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

340
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:17,320
- Yes.
- I'd like to make a little side bet.

341
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,347
Five hundred says
you don't come up with the story.

342
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:32,358
- What are you looking at that for?
- Just want to see what day it is.

343
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,364
- It's a deal.
- Now I'd like you to shake.

344
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,346
You're into me for about $500 now.

345
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,384
When you lose this bet,
you'll owe me $1,000.

346
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,351
You poor sucker,
I'll practically own you.

347
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,356
You practically have for a couple
of years but that's all over.

348
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,396
I'm going to win that money and buy
a one-way ticket back to New York.

349
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:00,387
Go on, I love to hear you whine.

350
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:04,366
When I'm back in a real
newsroom, I'll think of you,

351
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,405
sitting here with an empty leash
and nobody to twitch for you.

352
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,398
So long, pigeon.

353
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,441
- Signor Bradley.
- Everything OK, Giovanni?

354
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:47,410
Si Signor Joe.
Nobody come, nobody go.

355
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,438
- Absolutely nobody.
- Swell, thanks a lot.

356
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:59,456
Oh... Giovanni...
How'd you like to make some money?

357
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:01,423
- Money?
- Yeah.

358
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:05,427
That's the stuff. I've got a sure thing.

359
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,961
- Double your money back in two days.
- Double my money?

360
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:12,459
I need a little investment
capital to swing the deal.

361
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,463
Now if you'll lend me a little cash...

362
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:24,447
You owe me two months rent

363
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:27,485
and you want me to lend you money?

364
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,476
No.

365
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,481
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

366
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:40,545
Your Highness...?

367
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,552
Your Royal Highness...?

368
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,556
Yes, what is it?

369
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:34,661
Dear Dr Bannochhoven...

370
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:38,640
Oh, sure, yes, well...

371
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:42,679
You're fine, much better.
Is there anything you want?

372
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:46,673
- So many things.
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.

373
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,675
Tell the good doctor everything.

374
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,655
I dreamt and I dreamt...

375
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,682
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

376
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:02,664
I dreamt I was asleep in the street,

377
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:08,705
and a young man came,
he was tall and strong.

378
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,697
He was so mean to me.

379
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,701
He was?

380
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,710
It was wonderful.

381
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,744
Good morning.

382
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:06,753
- Where's Dr Bannochhoven?
- I'm afraid I don't know him.

383
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,757
- Wasn't I talking to him just now?
- Afraid not.

384
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,762
Have I had an accident?

385
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,764
No.

386
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,769
Quite safe for me to sit up, huh?

387
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,771
Perfectly.

388
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,782
Thank you.

389
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,795
Are these yours?

390
00:46:55,813 --> 00:47:00,807
- Did you lose something?
- No.

391
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,324
Would you be so kind
as to tell me where I am?

392
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,793
This is what is laughingly
known as my apartment.

393
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,825
- Did you bring me here by force?
- No, no. Quite the contrary.

394
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:24,831
- Have I been here all night... alone?
- If you don't count me, yes.

395
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,836
So I've spent the night here with you?

396
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:36,854
Well, I don't know that
I'd use those words exactly,

397
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:43,851
but from a certain angle, yes.

398
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,844
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

399
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,847
- And you are?
- Bradley, Joe Bradley.

400
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,886
- Delighted.
- You don't know how delighted I am.

401
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:12,878
- You may sit down.
- Thank you very much.

402
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,887
What's your name?

403
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,894
- You may call me Anya.
- Well thank you, Anya.

404
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,911
- Coffee?
- What time is it?

405
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:35,878
About one-thirty.

406
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,916
One-thirty! I must get dressed and go!

407
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:41,884
Why the hurry? There's lots of time.

408
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:45,922
No there isn't, and I've been
enough trouble as it is.

409
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:49,916
Trouble?
You're not what I'd call trouble.

410
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,922
- I'm not?
- I'll run a bath for you.

411
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,942
There you are.

412
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:58,983
Here we go now.

413
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:06,002
There you are, that does it. All right.

414
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:08,994
Give me a little slack, will you?

415
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,974
Irving! Why don't you answer?

416
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,013
It's Joe. Can you
get here in five minutes?

417
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:20,016
No, I can't come now, Joe, I'm busy.

418
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:21,983
Oh, no.

419
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,987
Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

420
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:30,027
Get into your next outfit.
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

421
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,993
I can't talk over the phone.

422
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:35,032
This whole thing
might easily blow sky-high.

423
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:38,000
It's front-page stuff,
that's all I can say.

424
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,038
It might be political or
a scandal, I don't know,

425
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:44,052
but it's a big story.
I need pictures.

426
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:47,033
But I can't come now, Joe, I'm busy.

427
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,037
And I'm meeting Francesca
at Rocca's in half an hour.

428
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,099
- Don't understand.
- Don't understand?

429
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,121
There you are.

430
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:22,139
I was looking at all the people.
It must be fun to live in a place like this.

431
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:26,143
It has its moments. I can give you
a commentary on each apartment.

432
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:28,134
I must go.

433
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:36,153
- I only waited to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? But we've only just met!

434
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:38,144
- How about breakfast?
- I haven't time.

435
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:44,161
It must be a pretty important date
to run off without eating.

436
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:47,128
- It is.
- I'll go with you.

437
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,156
That's all right, I can find the place.

438
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,162
Thank you for letting me
sleep in your bed.

439
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:02,179
- That's all right. Think nothing of it.
- It was very considerate of you.

440
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:05,181
You must've been awfully
uncomfortable on that couch.

441
00:53:05,217 --> 00:53:08,173
No, I do it all the time.

442
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:15,181
- Goodbye, Mr Bradley.
- Goodbye.

443
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,197
Go right through there,
and down all the steps.

444
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:23,189
Thank you.

445
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,199
- Well... Small world!
- Yeah.

446
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:01,237
I almost forgot.
Can you lend me some money?

447
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:03,204
Oh, yeah.

448
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,231
That's right,
you didn't have any did you?

449
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,213
How much was it you wanted?

450
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:15,240
I don't know. How much have you got?

451
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:20,257
Suppose we just split this fifty-fifty.
Here's a thousand lire.

452
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:23,248
A thousand!
Can you really spare all that?

453
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,228
- It's about a dollar and a half.
- Oh.

454
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:33,269
I'll arrange for it to be sent back to you.
What is your address?

455
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:35,789
Via Margutta 51.

456
00:54:35,824 --> 00:54:37,543
Via Margutta 51.

457
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,264
Joe Bradley.

458
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,268
Goodbye. Thank you.

459
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,297
Double my money, eh?
You tell me how?

460
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:03,288
- Tomorrow.
- Yes, tomorrow.

461
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,952
What a wonderful hair you have.

462
00:57:40,987 --> 00:57:44,450
- Just cut, thank you.
- Just cut?

463
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:50,467
- Well, then... Cut so?
- Higher.

464
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,458
- Higher? Here?
- More.

465
00:57:56,472 --> 00:57:58,463
- Here!
- Even more.

466
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,467
Where?

467
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,471
- There.
- There.

468
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,476
- Are you sure, Miss?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

469
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,481
- All off?
- All off.

470
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:19,483
Off!

471
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:31,496
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

472
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,500
Yes!

473
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,503
Off!

474
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,510
Off!

475
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,516
Off!

476
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,530
Oh no, no.

477
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,532
Off!

478
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,556
That's a nice camera
you have there. Nice...

479
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,560
You don't mind if I borrow it?
