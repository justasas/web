gravitated towards the coffee houses of

but if for my gift I brought you silence

86

or I know silence you would say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not silence this is another poem and you</font>

88
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:23,829
would hand it back to me it has some

89
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,628
merit I mean if you looked at it in

90
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,609
relation to American poetry being

91
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,870
published at that time and you're just

92
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,259
at the cusp of The Beat Generation

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,139
Howell is 1956 for example preceding it

94
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:39,069
it's pretty tame stuff but for Canada

95
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:43,360
whoa great here is a young writer found

96
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:47,229
his voice wasn't embarrassed to write

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,009
naked<font color="#CCCCCC"> ly about subjects that other poets</font>

98
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:53,769
had been much more discreet about that

99
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,949
would be the tradition of say EJ Pratt

100
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,948
who writes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best-seller</font>

101
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,680
called the last spike and it's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

102
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,960
poem about completing the railway across

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,968
the country that's the kind of subject

104
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,668
you'd find in Canadian poetry you

105
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:14,620
wouldn't you know find too much poetry

106
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:17,978
about being totally zonked on drugs and

107
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,778
trying to write you know music or poetry

108
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:22,538
which is what some of those poems are

109
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:23,889
about a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other poems are very</font>

110
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:27,218
personal and I think that was the other

111
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,468
thing that made it unique a kite is a

112
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:31,389
victim you are sure of you love it

113
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:33,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it pulls gentle enough to call</font>

114
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,639
you a master strong enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call you</font>

116
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,560
because it lives like a desperate train

117
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,538
falken in the high sweet air you can

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,810
always haul it down to tame it in your

119
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:46,968
drawer if you want to talk in purely

120
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,740
formal terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the poetry writing</font>

121

124
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,418

writing at that particular time it's

130
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,409
still a little early but he had this

131

acquaintance with Leighton which grew

132

think one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions with</font>

206

Leonard is why he never wrote another

change in artistic direction music had

in fact always been one of cones major

230
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,670
interesting was that it was really folk

as a poet novelist and he finds he's not

making a living and he gets out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

264
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:22,899
game and moves the song which I would

265
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:25,509
argue is where the kind of poetry

266
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,818
enjoyed by people who sit on their

269
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,560
the interest in that kind of verbiage

270
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:37,659
has gone and he went with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cohen's</font>

271

272
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:43,149
through key associates of Bob Dylan's

manager Albert Grossman his songs were

274
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:47,769
passed to folk singer Judy Collins

275
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,958
astounded by the unique and distinctive

276
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,818
poetry of the lyrics she recorded a

277
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,388
version of Cohen's most famous song

278

or Judy Collins was a great interpreter

282

of other people's songs and when Judy

283
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:08,139
Collins did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a song that was obviously</font>

284
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:11,139
completely different from the way of

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just can't go</font>

291
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,639
what it tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is it didn't say</font>

implicit in Leonard Cohen's material

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,818
wouldn't necessarily come through and

297
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,339
Judy Collins read it would be much

298
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:48,500
sweeter but it's a transformation job

299
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,730
from from top to bottom I mean you know

300
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,259
if you listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Judy Collins doing</font>

301

something like turn turn turn or

302
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,649
something sounds a completely different

303
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,720
song from the way you hear it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

and a time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> every purpose under</font>

306
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,670
I think anybody listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her songs</font>

307
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,278
would have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerted to Lenny cone as</font>

308
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:27,419
an important songwriter and one to watch

309
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:28,948
but they certainly would have had a

310
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,269
ruler wiping when they heard Leonard

311

that he was not just a composer but a

on the role of producer but unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

325
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,438
find sufficient gaps in his<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule the</font>

326
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,079
position was transferred to young talent

327
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:09,629
John Simon he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been signed by John</font>

328
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,878
Hammond and Leonard's complain at the

329
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:16,500
time was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Leonard was holed up in</font>

330
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:18,000
the Chelsea Hotel and he would have a

331
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,188
session with<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Hammond and john</font>

332
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,419
hammond would say some at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

333
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,818
during a session or right before the

334
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,110
session I'm sorry I we have to stop or I

335
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:27,149
have to cancel this session and Leonard

336
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,399
was there for another month in the

337
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,350
Chelsea Hotel about another session so

338
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,938
he had asked Columbia I suppose for a

339
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,759
different producer and they had paired

340
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:42,058
us up well first I knew him as a poet

341
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:43,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know and then I began to realize the</font>

342
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:47,519
kind of musician he was he wasn't the

343
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,750
guitar player<font color="#E5E5E5"> like most of the artists</font>

344
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,490
that i was working because most of the

345
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:54,720
artists came up through listening to pop

346
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,250
music so they knew how to play you know

347
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,449
rock and roller blues something like

348
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:03,240
that Leonard apparently learned how to

349
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:09,658
play classical guitar because he did

350
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:11,370
those things like real fast real fast it

351
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,780
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to record and was a</font>

352
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,629
pleasure it was a pleasure to record any

353
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:17,369
was smart you know it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

354
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,909
acts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recorded they weren't too</font>

355
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:24,058
smart<font color="#CCCCCC"> but Leonard was you know and smart</font>

356
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:27,899
and fun to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be with it and full of</font>

357
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:29,129
insight about things so I was an honor

358
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:32,129
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with Leonard you know what a</font>

359
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,930
pleasure Cohen's debut songs

360
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,120
Leonard Cohen was a distinguished<font color="#E5E5E5"> record</font>

361
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,850
both in its classical sound and in the

362
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">remarkable poetry of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lyrics with its</font>

363
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,289
unique opening track<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suzanne it heralded</font>

364
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,009
the arrival of an intimate and enigmatic

365
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:51,529
voice in<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern music Suzanne takes you</font>

366
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:55,819
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> her place near the</font>

367
00:17:51,529 --> 00:18:00,200
you can hear the boats go by you can

368
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:05,089
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name beside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Suzanne as a song</font>

369
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,830
I think it pitcher Mieses most of the

370
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">virtues that you hear in those early</font>

371
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:13,220
Leonard Cohen songs in that it is

372
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,440
written from life not that you know that

373
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,500
necessarily when you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear it and</font>

374
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,460
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to know it but it is</font>

375
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:26,180
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific Suzanne was indeed a woman</font>

376
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,970
that he knew in Montreal and she did

377
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,980
have a place by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water and she did</font>

378
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,069
feed UT and oranges because apparently

379
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,319
her speciality was this this tea that

380
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:39,919
she brewed with with bits of orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> peel</font>

381
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:42,109
in it so it's all drawn from experience

382
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,230
but then of course it's her a universal

383
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:48,259
in terms of its romantic message and

384
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:53,960
that was the key I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this</font>

385
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:58,279
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take very precisely observed</font>

386
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,829
details like the teal oranges and from

387
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,329
that create something that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

388
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:09,079
nonspecific<font color="#E5E5E5"> and entirely universal I was</font>

389
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:13,159
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where I was experimenting</font>

390
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:15,199
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold it was at the time 24 or 25</font>

391
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,029
something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had no idea</font>

392
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,309
what I was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was using my</font>

393
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:23,960
producing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to experiment on things and</font>

394
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:25,819
one thing I tried with Leonard's album

395
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,279
that I really liked and I still like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

396
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:30,329
this day is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use of women's voices</font>

397
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:34,379
instead of instruments

398
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:37,909
you want to travel with her and you want

399
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,660
to travel blind

400
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,970
no she will trust you for you touched

401
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,850
her<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

402
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,980
with your mind I love the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first album</font>

403
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:52,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">and i loved what john simon did to it I</font>

404
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:55,490
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people complained about</font>

405
00:19:52,910 --> 00:20:00,830
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> girls and all that stuff I</font>

406
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:03,589
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought this is cool Cohen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

407
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:07,159
actually for more vulgar than people

408
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:09,740
think he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's good I like that</font>

409
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,900
about him I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's now Joni</font>

410
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,789
Mitchell his first album is very spare

411
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,970
and to me completely unlistenable I

412
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:19,399
guess the the critical consensus on that

413
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">record at the time was a slight</font>

414
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,690
disappointment but ready to give him the

415
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:25,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">benefit of the doubt but to me I thought</font>

416
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it magnified him I thought it made him</font>

417
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:28,129
better and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the second</font>

418
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,259
record that I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so much</font>

419
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,270
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he spared down and I</font>

420
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,910
preferred him a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH locked up</font>

421
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:36,710
myself there's an authority to that

422
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,720
first letter code record in a sense it's

423
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,660
not a debut it's almost more like the

424
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,019
next collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stories or poems by</font>

425
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,750
Leonard Cohen you know it didn't have

426
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:51,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tentative feel that even great 60s</font>

427
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:54,740
debut albums have this was somebody who

428
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,269
clearly had an established voice as an

429
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,130
artist even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

430
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:00,859
tremendously well known in the United

431
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,470
States you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you were not listening</font>

432
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:08,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to somebody trying things out there was</font>

433
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:11,990
such a you know I the album is very

434
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,269
centered you know it just hits spot<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

435
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,130
what it's going for there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

436
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:17,779
really extraordinary about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a debut album</font>

437
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,150
an artist has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been writing these songs</font>

438
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,160
for quite a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years generally</font>

439
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,590
and so that the cream of the crop songs

440
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,840
the best songs and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

441
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,980
save the second the best songs for the

442
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,569
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> album they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna give you</font>

443
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,349
their second best songs you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

444
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:34,879
you their best songs and along with that

445
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:37,459
is the fact that the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> album is</font>

446
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,920
often the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to do because</font>

447
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,259
debut album will come out it'll be since

448
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,060
big sensation and people say well what's

449
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,829
this clown got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

450
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,659
then they're stuck and they have to

451
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:50,029
really scramble and write fast and

452
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,430
sometimes the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> album is forced and</font>

453
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:56,180
contrived but the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> album is always</font>

454
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:57,798
genuine and the the result of the

455
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,330
artist's soul from the time

456
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:01,849
they were born until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time that they</font>

457
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:04,398
make that album the album said someone

458
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:06,769
at the top of most people's Leonard

459
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:08,449
Cohen albums I mean it's difficult to

460
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:10,489
find what comes second and third and

461
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,889
fourth but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think most people would put</font>

462
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:16,519
out at the top and sweeping up the

463
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:20,028
Joker's that he left<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind you'll find</font>

464
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:25,099
he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not leave you very much not even</font>

465
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:29,420
laughter like any dealer he was watching

466
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:33,409
for the car that is so high and wild

467
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:38,240
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal another the words were what</font>

468
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:40,970
this was about and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music attempted</font>

469
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,370
to evoke am you a mood but not in any

470
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,559
not in it certainly not in any

471
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:48,079
aggressive way was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just things were kind</font>

472
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,179
of sketched in whereas the words are not

473
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,639
sketched in the words are<font color="#E5E5E5"> mysterious and</font>

474
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,210
enigmatic but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

475
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,430
and you know he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's almost reciting</font>

476
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,410
you know his singing voice is almost a

477
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,620
kind of recitation and has a very

478
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:07,550
hypnotic quality so again you know in an

479
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:09,679
era<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high psychedelia and you know the</font>

480
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,389

complicated in terms of the language and

487
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:30,410
in terms of the imagery and in terms of

the issues that he wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to confront but</font>

to tell and the fact it was on CBS

525

records connected into Dylan there's

526
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,618
also the fact that they're both Jewish

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're both great wordsmiths and they</font>

530
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:34,649
they both right<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly twisted love</font>

531
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:38,038
songs occasionally there's romance

00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:40,079
tempered with a certain pessimism and

533
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,819
darkness and melancholy in both of them

534
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,210
as well so the connections need to be

535
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,210
implicit

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,850
the desperate thing that people did

543
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:24,779
flailing about Cohen was plainly a very

544
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:27,240
different kind of versa fire Ben Dylan

545
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:32,700
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dylan was free associating</font>

546
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,940
plus calling on old sources but he was

547
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,620
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more free associating it was in</font>

548
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,200
the melodies that he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the old</font>

549
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:42,989
sources more than the words whereas

550
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,900
Cohen was a somebody who had been

551
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:49,230
writing full-time on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the page for I</font>

552
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:57,210
guess six seven eight years by the time

553
00:26:49,230 --> 00:27:00,029
he put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first record and it's</font>

554
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">much more controlled I think the only</font>

555
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">point where the comparison with Dylan</font>

556
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:12,300
was a fail or relevant one was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

557
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:17,370
actually for the first time you had here

558
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:21,000
a songwriter who not only wrote words as

559
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:23,699
great as Dylan but probably as a poet

560
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,859
exceeded Dylan so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course he was going</font>

561
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be compared because you know there</font>

562
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:30,119
weren't any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other fish in the pond or if</font>

563
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,610
the were they were minnows you know

564
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,979
there were these<font color="#CCCCCC"> two giant beasts and in</font>

565
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:38,849
in in literary terms I think the

566
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:42,569
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between them is that Dylan</font>

567
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:45,809
was a songwriter is a songwriter not a

568
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:50,129
poet that is to say the music and the

569
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:54,210
words work together and if you read that

570
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:57,630
big tome of Dylan's lyrics they don't

571
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,960
necessarily stand up that well a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

572
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,929
them are

573
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,240
the page they they need the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music to</font>

574
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:08,610
hold their hand as it where they work in

575
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,829
concert<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen undoubtedly was a poet as</font>

576
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:16,528
we know he was a published poet before

577
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:20,609
he was a recorded songwriter and in a

578
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:23,788
way he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write songs in this</font>

579
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:26,158
period he puts poetry to music and

580
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:29,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the distinction I think between</font>

581
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,610
Dillon and Cohen at this time because he

582
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,700
was a writer to begin with people always

583
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:38,788
think about his words<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read these</font>

584
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,610
books on him and it's verbal analysis I

585
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:46,408
think one reason he was as arresting as

586
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:53,668
he was is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> however he came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upon it</font>

587
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">he had a musical neck and you don't have</font>

588
00:28:53,669 --> 00:29:03,059
to understand musical technique very

589
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">well to know that a good melody is where</font>

590
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:09,329
you find it that they are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

591
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,908
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the training in the world and</font>

592
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:13,918
not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write good melodies you</font>

593
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:17,789
could have no training and have an

594
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,770
absolute genius for it and I wouldn't

595
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:23,069
say genius is exactly where I'd put him

596
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:27,179
but he definitely had a talent for it

597
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:30,509
and and without much question in my mind

598
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,038
it was the melodies as well as all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

599
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:34,500
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that made it happen if</font>

600
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,829
he hadn't had the melodies nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

601
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,839
have it wouldn't have happened I suppose

602
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:45,699
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he told you</font>

603
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:49,519
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep locked away in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head your</font>

604
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:53,870
master took you try

605
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,759
well at least that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the</font>

606
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:58,039
simplicity of the guitar accompaniment

607
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,609
on songs of Leonard Cohen itself made a

608
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:04,879
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of point there was kind of elegance</font>

609
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:06,709
very simple melodic elegance to it it

610
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,140
wasn't trying too hard to appeal to you

611
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it was very clearly an accompaniment</font>

612
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,950
to his voice I think the other pneus of

613
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,510
the sound that did stand out from what

614
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,340
was happening in rock and roll at that

615
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:23,390
time with Dylan having gone electric and

616
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:26,869
so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth he tapped into that</font>

617
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,810
sort of European<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jacques Brel type thing</font>

618
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:32,719
and you can hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the voice as</font>

619
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and that was somehow to me as a</font>

620
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,350
teenage kid listening to learn a color

621
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:42,049
this was very grown up you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1956</font>

622
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:46,099
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was really listening to</font>

623
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:48,589
chuck berry and Little Richard he's not

624
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:52,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">a child of the rock and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roll era I guess</font>

625
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:56,269
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to say and I think</font>

626
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that inevitably had quite a profound</font>

627
00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:01,250
impact on the sound I mean with Dylan

628
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,230
you know even on the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> so-called</font>

629
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,569
folk records you can kind of hear the

rock and<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying to get out you</font>

631
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:10,039
never get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with Leonard</font>

633

was released on Boxing Day 1967

634
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:17,149
receiving very limited public attention

635
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,850
in the US but faring far better in

636
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,500
Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Canada Cohen promoted the</font>

album with live shows and television

00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:51,720
that's a bit of a non voice but he has a

bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a kind of natural melodic</font>

something about is it the quality of his

trying to describe a wreath of

691
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:38,038
Franklin's voice how do you describe why

692
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:42,748
it is that Leonard Cohen makes you feel

693
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:44,220
intimate with him but he does so you

694
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:46,048
want to engage him when you hear this

695
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,749
voice coming out of the speakers he has

696
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:51,480
that quality after a chance meeting with

697
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:52,919
nashville-based producer Bob Johnston he

698
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,480
would notably worked the Bob Dylan on

699
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> singer-songwriters previous two</font>

700
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,649
releases<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen decided that his</font>

701
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:01,589
sophomore album required both a change

702
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:03,479
of scene and of personnel he moved to an

703
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:06,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">isolated farmhouse in Franklin Tennessee</font>

704
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,369
and enlisted Johnston services for the

705
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:11,369
recording<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the album songs from a room</font>

706
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,470
it surprised many on its release its

707
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,030
contents far more somber and melancholic

708
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:18,039
than the songs of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> debut the second</font>

709
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,350
album<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was the way in which he</font>

710
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:23,769
believed the music should go I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he</font>

711
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:26,860
was striving to remove the music the

712
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:29,949
sound out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the studio into the self</font>

713
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:34,809
and so he doesn't record it in New York

714
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:36,879
it's in Tennessee he was living on this

715
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:38,529
remarkable<font color="#E5E5E5"> little farm in Franklin</font>

716
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,409
Tennessee which is about which I have

717
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,560
been to which is about 30 miles perhaps

718
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:46,900
out of Nashville and it was very

719
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:50,710
influenced by the isolation of that and

720
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:53,110
that fit his romantic notion of the

721
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,970
artist<font color="#E5E5E5"> the artist and this is really out</font>

722
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:59,320
of Byron and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's out of Shelley and</font>

723
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:01,750
it's even out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of blake is a bard who</font>

724
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,630
present past and future<font color="#E5E5E5"> sees and he is</font>

725
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,210
alone on the mountaintop Leonard was

726
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">alone occasional woman of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course but</font>

727
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,440
alone in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small little farm in</font>

728
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,750
Franklin Tennessee where he<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

729
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,750
recorded some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the songs right there</font>

730
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:19,030
very minimalist manner and then we go

731
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,550
into Nashville and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know do a studio</font>

732
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,370
version of it but i think it was for him

733
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,760
what he believed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the natural to</font>

734
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:30,029
the natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolution of his music when</font>

735
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm hard across the board</font>

736
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:36,800
I was cautioned to surrender this I

737
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,799
could not do

738
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:45,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">I took my gun and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the nature of</font>

739
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,630
those songs how they were recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

740
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,910
absence of ornamentation musical

741
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,340
ornamentation was what he wanted which I

742
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:54,859
think he also felt was part of a certain

743
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,730
purity to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> music that he wanted to</font>

744
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:02,840
intensify even as songs of Leonard Cohen

745
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,449
sounded like you know a completely fully

746
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,660
conceived work I think Leonard Cohen

747
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:10,789
felt that he had further to go you know

748
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:14,869
Justin and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he wanted to pursue and</font>

749
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:20,210
so the even more extreme starkness of

750
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:21,619
the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> album uh it gets at that you</font>

751
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">know just say well how far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

752
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:28,069
take this it is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> stripped-down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

753
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:31,519
beautifully titled songs from a room you

754
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:34,910
know that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sums up both the sound</font>

755
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:37,789
of the record<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the sentiment of the</font>

756
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:39,769
lyrics it's got this chamber quality for

757
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:43,699
those who have this image of Leonard

758
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:46,009
Cohen as the guitar strumming troubadour

759
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:48,949
this is the closest the truest it gets

760
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,780
to that sound although<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority of</font>

761
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the album maintained this minimal</font>

762
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,130
aesthetic for many its strongest track

763
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:58,490
was the slightly more embellished opener

764
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">bird on a wire based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lyric he had</font>

765
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:02,689
developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> while staying in the island of</font>

766
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,760
Hedra it would become like Suzanne on

767
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,159
the previous album one of Cohen's most

768
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,930
recognized signature tunes and a firm

769
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,929
live favorite for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of his career</font>

770
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:25,079
like a drunk in some old midnight

771
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,079
I

772
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:35,078
in my way

773
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:38,649
to be free

774
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:40,269
it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very of course prosaic</font>

775
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,160
account of what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened it's</font>

776
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:44,498
it's about telegraph poles that were

777
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,298
introduced into the island<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first</font>

778
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:48,278
time so there we have been a cone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

779
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,900
this island seemingly free from

780
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:51,309
civilization you know writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

781
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,519
isolation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and suddenly you know</font>

782
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:56,410
technology enters his world and he sees

783
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:59,078
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise window he sees a bird perched</font>

784
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:01,298
upon a wire and that inspired him to

785
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,059
write this this song about freedom but i

786
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:07,568
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the longing to</font>

787
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:10,329
be free is a motif as well within the

788
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:12,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">song that connects with people</font>

789
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:15,489
particularly in the late 60s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

790
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:17,170
it's just it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a strong lyric from</font>

791
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:19,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time and it's a song that that</font>

792
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,298
people just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover as well and I</font>

793
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:24,159
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effect that it you know it's</font>

794
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:26,768
so amenable to being a cover version

795
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,719
makes makes it more Universal than it

796
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:30,098
might otherwise have been I think the

797
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,349
reason that so many people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

798
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,599
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the reason why had stood</font>

799
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:36,219
up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of his own work is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

800
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,778
it is a great tune you wouldn't

801
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:39,338
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily know it from listening to</font>

802
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:41,858
his version it's a fabulous tune and

803
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:44,078
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

804
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:45,670
of his lyrics but it's a great lyric the

805
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,229
couplet like a worm on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hook like a</font>

806
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,199
knight from an old-fashioned book I

807
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:53,108
think as a description of of men in love

808
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:55,298
I think you have right there what we

809
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:56,889
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are or what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the</font>

810
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:58,449
night in the old-fashioned book and yet

811
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:00,159
I think in those circumstances what we

812
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:01,479
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually are a lot of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

813
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,548
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worm on the hook and I</font>

814
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:05,048
think that's that's a that's a

815
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:07,630
definitive mine in current moment right

816
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:10,509
there if you had to pick one song to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sum</font>

817
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,789
up the appeal of letter code that might

818
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:16,389
well be it you know from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opening</font>

819
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:19,239
line like a bird on a wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a drunk</font>

820
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:22,958
in a midnight choir I have tried in my

all those beautiful losers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'd</font>

823

written about in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the novel the drunk in</font>

824
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:32,798
the midnight choir that we all associate

825
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:35,229
with you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> none of us want to be</font>

826
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:37,599
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prissy little choirboy who</font>

827
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:39,608
hits every note spot on you'd much

828
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,559
rather be the drunk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back row who</font>

829
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:44,949
wants to be part of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

830
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:47,589
joining in from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very best of mode</font>

831
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:50,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">kids and spirits and but he's actually</font>

832
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:52,539
preventing the whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're</font>

833
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,650
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express yourself and this is</font>

00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:58,029
my way of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be free yeah there's</font>

835
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,358
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that song that really</font>

836
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,790
sums up the spirit of what early that

837
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,440
occurred was all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the album was</font>

838
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:07,719
released in april nineteen sixty-nine

839
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,210
and was a tremendous success in Europe

840
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:12,279
it reached number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two in the British</font>

841
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,559
charts and made Cohen a star in France

<font color="#CCCCCC">where in one periodical he was declared</font>

843
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">folk singer of the year yet in America</font>

844
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:22,329
he was struggling to secure a sizable

845
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:24,039
mainstream audience despite three tracks

846
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:25,750
from his debut appearing prominently in

847
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:29,139

something that Cohen has still not

851
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,470
attracted it always was a sense of his

852
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,750
being a little removed in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

853

857
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,420
sometimes it does but you have to really

<font color="#CCCCCC">want it and be willing to do whatever it</font>

ever particularly felt that way so along

with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the fact that he's writing</font>

complicated songs and the fact that is

863
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:08,679
his singing voice is not necessarily you

864
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:12,099
know you know a conventional hit

866
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:16,599
person an artist who's probably a little

867
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,369
ambivalent about all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff Leonard</font>

868
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,039
is not interested in entertaining he's

869
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:23,140
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in engaging and that's what</font>

870
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,230
he's able to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that music both</font>

871
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:28,210
recorded and in person he engages the

872
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,358
audience he does not entertain them it

873
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:35,019
appeals to certain people very strongly

874
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:37,358
but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainstream what are his</font>

875
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:39,068
album sales compared to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dylan's we're</font>

876
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,500
probably I don't even think they're a

third if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> total figures right</font>

of Dylan's Dylan<font color="#CCCCCC"> has at some point in</font>

879
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:52,118
his career probably very early on

880
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:54,639
encourage the mainstream effort in terms

881
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,880
of how his<font color="#E5E5E5"> career is managed where he</font>

882
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,548
has performed

883
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,460
the kinds of songs he writes and

884
00:41:58,548 --> 00:42:04,159
certainly how his albums have been

885
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,880
marketed Leonard doesn't take that

886
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,608
proactive you at all and you know he

887
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,130
recognizes he's a minor voice and he's

888
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:14,750
been relatively satisfied with that you

889
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,720
never get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that Leonard is so</font>

890
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,809
frustrated in not crossing the line to

891
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:25,189
be in what the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 Billboard albums</font>

892
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:27,920
of the week in march 1970 work began on

893
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,289
songs for a further album rooted firmly

894
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,539
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nashville Cohen once again teamed up</font>

895
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:34,278
with Bob Johnston who suggested the use

896
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:36,410
of a group of musicians with whom he had

897
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:39,559
worked on Dylan's recent new<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning</font>

898
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:41,750
album guitarist Ron Cornelius became the

899
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:43,460
impromptu<font color="#CCCCCC"> band leader and was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

900
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,949
both in the instrumentation of the

901
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,230
as-yet-untitled new record and with the

902
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:51,230
preparations for a full band live tour

903
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,699
day one all I knew was that I was

904
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,548
getting involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with somebody that was</font>

905
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:57,710
a intellectual classical guy that

906
00:42:55,548 --> 00:42:59,900
doesn't sing very well you know they

907
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,210
just like that and it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

908
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,650
little while to really understand you

909
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,559
know really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're dealing with here</font>

910
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:09,950
you know and so therefore it became more

911
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:12,079
of a mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I think I when</font>

912
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:14,509
I say that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I'm really talking</font>

913
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,609
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the girls I'm talking about the</font>

914
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:18,170
players in the band we were it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

915
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:20,480
much like a family<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was like</font>

916
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:22,670
we're on this this mission together you

917
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,338
know with many of the new songs written

918
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,170
and the musicians fully prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen</font>

919
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:30,108
delayed the studio<font color="#CCCCCC"> recording and went on</font>

920
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road with this new band the army the</font>

921
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:34,338
tour which encompassed many European

922
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,559
destinations as well as major American

923
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:37,969
and Canadian cities also included a

924
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,548
performance at the prestigious isle of

00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:48,079
translating what had often been acoustic

928
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,730
tracks into a live context required a

929
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:55,039
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> disciplined approach from the band</font>

930
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:57,139
we knew that Leonard's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lenarz message</font>

931
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,549
his lyrics everything we had to make

932
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:00,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that the people that came to see</font>

933
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:06,500
him got what they wanted to see it

934
00:44:00,858 --> 00:44:08,670
became such a such a unique delivery

935
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,010
that

936
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,838
it was like it was like that feeling

937
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if one person wasn't there you</font>

938
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:17,039
couldn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that night it was a big</font>

939
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:19,710
responsibility on me because being the

940
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">band leader</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that if anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

941
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:26,190
right they came to me they didn't go to

942
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:27,990
the person that wasn't well you know

943
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,579
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't hitting it at</font>

944
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:31,139
night you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they would come to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

945
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:33,150
then I would have to go to that person

946
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:34,828
say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get together with this</font>

947
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,530
and fix this or fix that but

948
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:40,380
consequently it was it was a real effort

949
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:42,298
by everybody and it was it truly was

950
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,539
like a family<font color="#E5E5E5"> running all over the world</font>

951
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:47,608
and it was some some of the some of the

952
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:51,199
nicest music that I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

953
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:51,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved Suzanne</font>

954
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:03,250
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> river she's wearing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rags and</font>

955
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:07,929
feathers from salvation army countess

956
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:11,289
and the Sun Leonard as a performer is

957
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:13,629
happiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think when he's got company</font>

958
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:17,019
on stage he always<font color="#E5E5E5"> has backup singers</font>

959
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:19,900
and he usually has a substantial group

960
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:22,690
accompanying him it's not just Leonard

961
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:26,740
and a piano man or Leonard and you know

962
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:28,869
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a drum kit Leonard's concerts</font>

963
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:32,529
I think achieve their effectiveness

964
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:34,779
partly because he's got a community with

965
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:37,480
him and when he does perform and he goes

966
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,630
on tour he establishes this community

967
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crucial for him they provide a</font>

968
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:46,570
support for you know for him as the

969
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,700
performer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental thing is that</font>

970
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:52,240
he is part of a group and that group is

971
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:54,009
becomes a tour family and they do things

972
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,509
together they travel together Leonard

973
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,720
doesn't hop on the jet and everybody

974
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,190
else comes by bus after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool Cohen</font>

975
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,259
and the band returned to the studio to

976
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,929
record the new songs under the watchful

977
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,930
eye of producer Bob Johnston Bob

978
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:10,059

00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:14,960
hilt I mean magic can happen when you

996
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,150
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff together the</font>

997
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,179
album songs of love and hate was

998
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:23,059
released in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March 1971 combining both</font>

999
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:25,250
the familiar spare acoustic numbers with

1000
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:28,309
live tracks that captured the new full

1001
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:30,829
band sound despite its lack of

1002
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:32,960
commercial success it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> received by</font>

1003
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:35,299
many critics as confirmation of Cohen's

1004
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,730
unique talent and remains a landmark

1005
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:40,820
record in his cannon well love and hate

1006
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:43,429
is possibly then it goes bleakest album

1007
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,900
the cover alone would suggest out<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1008
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:46,639
always smile on the cover it's

1009
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,660
definitely it's black and white and

1010
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:53,629
although it's it's called songs of love

1011
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:55,759
and hate and I'm sure you know many

1012
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:58,160
critics have looked at that album and

1013
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,420
gone through and said yet that songs

1014
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:00,769
about love that song about hate that

1015
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,849
songs about love that songs about hey I

1016
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at all I</font>

1017
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:06,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think it's his structured as that</font>

1018
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,329
would suggest i think the love and hate

1019
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:10,730
intermingles and that album very strange

1020
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:12,590
in different ways at<font color="#CCCCCC"> times there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1021
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are at least elements of Cohen's</font>

1022
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:18,500
wry humor coming through Joan of Arc for

1023
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:21,230
instance which is a song<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Niko the</font>

1024
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:23,809
sometimes guest singer from The Velvet

1025
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:26,420
Underground she was a known heroin

1026
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:30,858
addict self-destructive in a sense and

1027
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,210
thus the<font color="#CCCCCC"> image of Joan of Arc but i</font>

1028
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:34,460
often find when i listened to that

1029
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,619
record i thought it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is roy</font>

1030
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,530
huber on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cohen's part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean he talks</font>

1031
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a smoky night the night suddenly</font>

1032
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,369
becomes very<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoky you said Joan of art</font>

1033
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,990
was burned at the stake for goodness

1034
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:48,740
sake a so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is he playing with</font>

1035
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:52,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and he put some particular stress</font>

1036
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:54,079
on the word heroin when he's talking

1037
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,629
about Joan of Arc as a heroine and you

1038
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,989
think yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nico heroine ok we get it but</font>

1039
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:01,849
it is it is playful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1040
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:03,449
cognoscenti and that's what coven is

1041
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:07,860
doing a lot there

1042
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:13,649
well I'm glad to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear you talk this way</font>

1043
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:22,440

1044
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:25,710
day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> something in me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to win I've</font>

1045
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,869
got a long career behind me he looked

1046
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the color of this hair you know I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1047
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:32,699
long career behind me and I've got I've

1048
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,260
got a lot of accomplishments songs of

1049
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,509
love and hates right out there in front

1050
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,390
I mean it may be to me one of the best

1051
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:42,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I've ever done you know it was</font>

1052
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:44,849
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most involved musical</font>

1053
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,190
endeavors that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever been involved</font>

1054
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:48,869
with in the studio it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something</font>

1055
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,070
that you knew when you were working on

1056
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:53,609
it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something that's very</font>

1057
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">special and it's got to be right and we</font>

1058
00:49:53,610 --> 00:50:03,329
didn't settle for seconds it's four in

1059
00:49:56,219 --> 00:50:06,959
the morning the end of December I'm

1060
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:12,659
writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now just to see if you better</font>

1061
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,559
New York is cold but I like where I'm

1062
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:18,690
living

1063
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:23,340
music on Clinton Street all through the

1064
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:24,570
evening now famous blue raincoat is boy

1065
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:28,980
that's but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's another one that</font>

1066
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:34,140
although we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't relate very well to</font>

1067
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:36,240
the way Cohen relates to women<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so far</font>

1068
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:39,029
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want it summed up that sums it up</font>

1069
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,699
really good either it's explicitly

1070
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,620
autobiographical or he wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

1071
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:45,569
think it's explicitly autobiographical

1072
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:47,369
there is no other reason why you would

1073
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:49,980
finish a song with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line sincerely</font>

1074
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:51,690
old Cohen he really more than any other

1075
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,760
song he's ever recorded it puts himself

1076
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,220
right into the middle of this and it is

1077
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,500
it is a letter and it's fairly clear as

1078
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:01,349
the song goes on but it is a letter to a

1079
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:04,199
former<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend and now rival in love of</font>

1080
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:08,579
his who his wife seems to have left him

1081
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:10,919
for but she's come back so he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> won but</font>

1082
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:14,130
the general town of the record is that

1083
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,380
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly hollow victory there are</font>

1084
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,789
certain key things in the song which you

1085
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,119
know leap out at you I think

1086
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:23,400
particularly there's some wonderful

1087
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,909
lines in it there's the line about Jane

1088
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:30,000
after the affair has taken place taking

1089
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:36,629
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mentos a lock of hair that she takes</font>

1090
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:39,869
from the unnamed adulterer and it's on

1091
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:43,619
the night<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he tried to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go clear and</font>

1092
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:45,179
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't pointedly asked him in the</font>

1093
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,589
song<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever get did you</font>

1094
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:49,019
ever go clear did you ever get clear

1095
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:51,660
clear of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you know clear of drugs</font>

1096
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:54,929
will know i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clear is a pretty</font>

1097
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:57,269
explicit reference to scientology and we

1098
00:51:54,929 --> 00:52:00,419
do know that linda cohn was interested

1099
00:51:57,269 --> 00:52:03,570
in Scientology at the time and so to be

1100
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:06,059
clear was the holy grail of<font color="#CCCCCC"> scientology</font>

1101
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:09,690
if you went clear it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you'd rid</font>

1102
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:11,820
yourself of all neurosis it imbues you

1103
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,369
with almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> superpowers took you to a</font>

1104
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:17,760
new level did you ever go clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1105
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:20,460
that line what a great line I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1106
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,870

avalanche and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to suicide</font>

1113
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:40,059
on dress rehearsal rag proved

1114
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,010
off-putting to certain members of the

1115
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:45,219
music press who found Cohen's work

1116
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:47,110
depressing ever since<font color="#E5E5E5"> his debut some</font>

1117
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:48,969
critics<font color="#E5E5E5"> had reacted negatively to the</font>

1118
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:51,430
melancholy of the Leonard Cohen sound

1119
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:53,169
and the painful introspection in songs

1120
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:54,819
of love and hate led to further

1121
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,519
accusations that the singer was

1122
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,200
indulgent and self-pitying or an

1123
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,909
impediment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the enjoyment of Leonard</font>

1124
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:03,879
Cohen for many listeners particularly

1125
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:07,149
for many mainstream lessness is that

1126
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,730
they see songs as bleak it's no

1127
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,559
coincidence that the you know famously a

1128
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,670
reviewer of someone's in love and hate

1129
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,619
said you know they should they should

1130
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,889
give razor blades away when they sell

1131
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:19,779
this album in stores or whatever and you

1132
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:21,969
know that is the popular image of the

1133
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,680
early Leonard Cohen and it's an image

1134
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:25,509
that it took a long time to rid himself

1135
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,129
often some people would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it still</font>

1136
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't you know that those old jokes</font>

1137
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:32,650
still are used to this day<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I think</font>

1139
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:42,130
around that time there is a certain

bleep quality to that record yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1141

bad qualities for the sinners

1144
00:53:50,719 --> 00:54:03,429
I stepped into an Avalon

1145
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:08,409
it covered up my soul when I

1149
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:22,118

1155
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:38,230
Saturday night and I think that's a

1156
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:41,230
stronger more intellectually respectable

1157
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:45,010
point of view most people think

1158
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:50,139
pessimism is a sign of<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriousness I</font>

1159
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:53,470
don't and Leonard<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen is a pessimist</font>

1160
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:56,588
maricon has a very pessimistic cast of

00:54:53,469 --> 00:55:01,629
mind but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my mind he triumphs over</font>

1162
00:54:56,588 --> 00:55:06,578
this with his wit his charm his craft

1163
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:10,210
the poetic nature tends to be

1164
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:14,410
introspective and melancholic going back

1165
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:19,210
to Keats and the romantics of the 19th

1166
00:55:14,409 --> 00:55:27,009
century that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was also i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

and dying young Keats Shelley and in

1169
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:38,108
fact there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a famous interview that</font>

1170
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:40,838
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cohen gave in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> late 1960s where he</font>

actually talks about great poets doing

tempered with with a wonderful wit and

1176
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:59,139
humor that that often gets overlooked in

1177
00:55:56,199 --> 00:56:02,618
1972 Cohen and the army began a new

1178
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:04,659
larger scale world tour the following

Tel Aviv

1186
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,250
and performing on the front line despite

1187

the many valid criticisms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Israeli</font>

position in 1974 he returned to music

into his old horn New York in a notable

1190
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,570
departure from his recent musical

00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,519
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen steered clear of</font>

1192
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,200
Nashville and began working on new

Charlie Daniels Band as his thing and it

1197
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:48,159
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nashville ish you know that</font>

pose Dylan thing where you take a

singer-songwriter and you know put some

1200
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:54,130
some country guys with him and that's

1201
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:56,680
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was and it was it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but</font>

1202
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:59,800
it wasn't Leonard wasn't doing anything

new in and of itself except for how

1204
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,150
great he and his songs were the music

1205
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:05,559
had that kind of it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing well</font>

1206
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,710
we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing these songs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did I</font>

1207

down bluesy quality to what I played

1209
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:19,990
some very funky clarinet and it was

<font color="#CCCCCC">Spacey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and moody without being standard</font>

music on this album with one or two

1213

exceptions why he had faith in<font color="#E5E5E5"> me right</font>

off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bat I don't know it turned out</font>

1215
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:33,940
that we worked great together but he saw

1216
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a collaboration that I mean</font>

1217

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't even thinking I was just saying</font>

1218
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:40,210
oh yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try this let's try that</font>

1219
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,980
with an entirely new backing band<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1220
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,780

common with John Simon's production on

1222
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,710
Cohen's debut than the stripped-down

1223
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,040
Nashville sound of the previous two

1224
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:53,289
records he mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time</font>

1225
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,820
the John's I'm Simon album and I don't

1226
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:56,679
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the details but I do know</font>

1227
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:59,830
that he looked at it the same way that

1228
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:02,139
Leonard's music their pieces the little

1229
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:05,170
work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of framing them or</font>

1230
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:08,109
give them as you it's an embellishments

1231
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:10,900
more in coloration than anything else

1232
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:15,309
i'm setting the tone nothing that we did

1233
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:16,750
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> new skin was really thick or overdone</font>

1234
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:19,210
there's a lot of transparency to it but

1235
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,710
there are colors<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on like crazy you</font>

1236
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:22,599
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people talk about that field</font>

1237

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> floating around</font>

1239
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:29,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time must have been right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1240
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:33,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">because he didn't did those paired</font>

1241
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:36,589
albums that Nashville / folk albums that

1242
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,380
did to me just sit there a bit the songs

1243
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:41,539
were so strong that it sustained it time

1244
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:46,400
because he had that you was still so new

1245
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:49,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the songs that we started working on</font>

1246
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,869
I thought could just have a little more

1247
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:56,360
color to them so who by fire which has

1248
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:58,369
all that little<font color="#E5E5E5"> those little spaces and</font>

1249
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,309
those kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of emotional things and the</font>

1250
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:05,089
cars are happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the girls and it</font>

1251
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:07,190
in a way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it came easily because for</font>

1252
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:19,460
some reason it his songs inspired me to

1253
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:23,450
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way in sunshine and the</font>

1254
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">nighttime by the time we get to new skin</font>

1255
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:27,679
for the old ceremony it's a different

<font color="#CCCCCC">lender</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conus emerged it's there's a</font>

break there it's completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

1258
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:34,820
record from what we've what we've heard

1259
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:37,639

of ways in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might die and</font>

Jewish prayer which was written in the

extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordy they're very inquisitive</font>

they're very questing they're also very

1299
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:14,920
funny a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time and who by fire</font>

1300
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:16,150
he's taking what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prayer that his</font>

01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,730
people have been making<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ten</font>

1302
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,170
centuries and there's a attaching a

<font color="#E5E5E5">punchline to the end of it the sort of</font>

1304
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:24,970
like the and who shall I say is calling

1305
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:28,529
is quite a great gag to stick in the

1306
01:01:24,969 --> 01:01:28,529
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a recast prayer</font>

1307

shall I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say is calling</font>

1308
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:43,839
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to frame his stuff take his</font>

1309
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:46,779
thing as pieces and put them in

1310
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:50,380
interesting frames make them visual make

1311
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:52,119
them cinematic maybe so we did that he

1312
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,769
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> take songs like a lover lover</font>

1313
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:57,160
lover and instead of it being little

1314
01:01:53,769 --> 01:02:01,539
folk song we put kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethiopian</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was exciting Leonard could write off</font>

1317
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,650
on and it was that it was like a

1318
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">different approach</font>

1319
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">cohen need something to tense that</font>

1320

1321
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:40,150
was really perfect in terms of the way

1322
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:43,419
he can see the music I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I mean he</font>

1323
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:46,869
you know he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cohen's a smart guy he</font>

1324
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:48,550
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> with good people and and he</font>

1325
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:49,900
doesn't mess up his productions anymore

1326
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:53,530
but I wouldn't call the production in

1327
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:57,639
the recent records inventive the way I

1328
01:02:53,530 --> 01:03:01,840
witless hours there are touches there

phase of Leonard Cohen's career where he

1334
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,950
is no longer the acoustic troubadour

that he's he's soon going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be out</font>

01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:33,940
from now on is is cohen been much more

1342
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:37,959
comfortable working with an ensemble

1343
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:42,190
with the new skin for old ceremony he'd

1348
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:57,369
you do have this quite conscious effort

01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:59,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to expand the sound I don't think</font>

1350
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:03,219
entirely successfully but then I

1351
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,110
wouldn't because these were my formative

1352
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:08,739
years I bought those first three records

when they came out when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 16</font>

was only a modest commercial success and

1359
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:27,459
critical opinion was divided over the

1360
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:29,500
more ornate arrangements he had one song

1361
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:32,199
once again stood out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become one of</font>

1362

Cohen's most recognized Chelsea Hotel

tale of Cohen's brief love affair<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

1376
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,289
as a writer is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's really</font>

1377
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:15,510
necessary to know all that much about

1378
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:17,849
him personally to appreciate the songs

1379
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and actually I tend to think a lot of</font>

1380
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:22,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">them probably better appreciated the</font>

1381
01:05:19,769 --> 01:05:25,829
less you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about the author which is</font>

1382
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:28,139
one of the reasons I think Chelsea Hotel

1383
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:30,000
number two really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work at all I</font>

1384
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:32,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean for a start I don't I really don't</font>

1385
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,079
think it's anything like a great Leonard

1386
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:36,509
Cohen song I don't think it's even an

1387
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,489
especially good one I think that Thun is

1388
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:40,800
one I've always forgotten even while i

1389
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:45,599
was listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the lyric is</font>

1390
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:47,670
even if you don't know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Janis</font>

1391
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,559
Joplin it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line about you know</font>

1392
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:51,930
giving me head on an unmade bed bulb in

1393
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:55,170
the scenes waited outside is it's it's

1394
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:56,940
graceless it's showing off and it sounds

1395
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:59,070
like David Lee Roth I mean really<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1396
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:00,960
take it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that context it's it's</font>

1397
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:03,180
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very Leonard Cohen lyric and the</font>

1398
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,250
the line about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one about</font>

1399
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:06,750
her preferring handsome men but for me

1400
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:09,659
you said you'd make an exception that

1401
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:11,519
it's he's a lot funnier than that

1402
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:13,440
usually and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than that again</font>

1403
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:16,440
it underlines the fact as with Joan of

1404
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,970
Arc that when the person is named

1405
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:23,670
whether it be an eco or a janis joplin a

1406
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:25,199
place for porridge sense of oh you know

1407
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:27,329
that's a song about<font color="#CCCCCC"> x and we can</font>

1408
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,710
visualize<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person but in a way that's</font>

1409
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:30,840
kind of self limiting in a way no I

1410
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:33,179

1411
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:34,950
absolutely right when he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> damn and I</font>

01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">regret ever saying it was about Janis</font>

1414
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:40,530
been about every woman in the show's

hotel at the time it would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1416
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,610
probably better I think you know

1417
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:47,460
applying it solely to Janis Joplin which

1418
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:51,420
we now can't help but doing and it seems

1419
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:53,280
so explicitly so is regrettable Cohen

1420
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,110
was happy with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> album and immediately</font>

1421
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,420
returned to the studio with John<font color="#CCCCCC"> lesueur</font>

1422
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:59,849
to work on the follow-up despite this

1423
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:03,269
momentum with several songs completed in

<font color="#CCCCCC">the can the album was abandoned cowan</font>

1425
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,690
went on tours with many of the backing

1426
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,480
band that had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in new skin</font>

1427
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:11,550
but in 1975 stepped off of the musical

1428
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,949
stage and out of the public eye once

1429
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:16,349
more he did not begin working on another

1430
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:17,788
album until 1977

1431
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:20,369
when he was introduced<font color="#CCCCCC"> to legendary</font>

being as mad as a frog in a sock he was

just nuts and you know subsequent or

recent events may still be sub judice<font color="#CCCCCC"> II</font>

1441
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:45,838
but they would seem to sort of conform

1442
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:48,150
with various patterns of his previous

1443
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,768
behavior he was also famous as a

informed those great girl group hits of

what an artist coming to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill would</font>

1468
01:08:56,889 --> 01:09:02,710
expect the term wall of sound was

1469

applied to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique production Spector</font>

1470
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:07,088
had developed along with the engineers

at gold star studios in los angeles it

1472
01:09:07,088 --> 01:09:11,500
had been the defining characteristic of

1473
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,899
many highly successful records and had

1474
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:17,529
the potential to cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen over into</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainstream the wall of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sound was</font>

1476

what it sounds it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was absolutely</font>

1477
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:24,129
there's monumental creation of basically

1478
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:27,429
compressing an entire symphony orchestra

1479
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:29,289
into a three minute pop song it was not

1480
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:31,060
dissimilar in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> respects to what</font>

1481
01:09:29,289 --> 01:09:33,698
the Beatles did and of course he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1482
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> produce to let it be album everything</font>

01:09:33,698 --> 01:09:37,149
George Martin<font color="#CCCCCC"> brought to those more</font>

1484
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:39,369
orchestral Beatles records he crept from

1485
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:42,579
Phil Spector the Beach Boys Pet Sounds

1486
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:45,519
was to a huge extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Wilson's</font>

1487
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:46,719
homage or attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emulate Phil</font>

1488
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,420
Spector I mean he's one of the most

1489
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,130
influential figures in modern popular

1490
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:53,319
music has absolutely no doubt about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1491
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:56,469
at all there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many interpretations of</font>

1492
01:09:53,319 --> 01:10:00,639
what the wall of sound was actually it's

1493
01:09:56,469 --> 01:10:03,520
a combination of many things the echo

1494
01:10:00,639 --> 01:10:06,819
chamber is a very important part of it

1495
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:10,510
but the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phil brought too many</font>

1496
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:13,420
musicians into a room added to the

1497
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:16,300
effect and this is where the wall sound

1498
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:19,539
came from because he had literally sound

1499
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:21,369
from wall to wall but without the echo

1500
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:25,750
chamber it wouldn't have existed and

1501
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:28,779
probably vice versa either it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd to</font>

1502
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:31,599
seem working with something I expect

1503
01:10:28,779 --> 01:10:34,238
but the same time I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was an</font>

1504
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:37,569
element of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship which could</font>

1505
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:38,738
and should have worked Spector had been

1506
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:40,269
brought in at the tail end of the

1507
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:42,819
Beatles career he you know worked

1508
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:44,949
infamously on let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be and we know the</font>

1509
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:48,009
stories about<font color="#CCCCCC"> his production there his</font>

1510
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:49,058
wall of sound his epic production was

1511
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,520
something that had been strongly

1512
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:53,920
associated with the 60s<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time</font>

1513
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,960
Spector was working in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early 70s he</font>

1514
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,270
got involved with John Lennon in the

1515
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,980
early stages of his career and worked on

1516
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:02,860
the classic johnanon plastic ono band

1517
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:05,049
now that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant piece of work</font>

1518
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a brilliant collaboration and it</font>

1519
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:10,989
showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what might have happened</font>

1520
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:13,090
between Spector and Cohen although a

1521
01:11:10,988 --> 01:11:15,129
fusing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specter sound with Cohen's</font>

1522
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:17,288
lyrics would obviously lead to a radical

1523
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:19,779
departure from previous releases the

1524
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:22,029
producer decided like John Liz or and

1525
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:25,779
John Simon<font color="#E5E5E5"> before him to juxtapose</font>

1526
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:27,729
Cohen's voice with female singers he

1527
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:30,340
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push this idea further on</font>

1528
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:32,229
three tracks by having Cohen duet with

1529
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,750
the actress and country singer ronee

1530
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:36,698
blakley who had recently been a part of

1531
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder review tool</font>

1532
01:11:36,698 --> 01:11:40,868
all voices blend with Leonard but I

1533
01:11:39,219 --> 01:11:45,158
think female voices are especially

1534
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:47,649
touching Leonard has in his voice a

1535
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:51,519
slight trembling from time to time which

1536
01:11:47,649 --> 01:11:54,638
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely vulnerable than real and</font>

1537
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,789
present and there it's at the front of

1538
01:11:54,639 --> 01:12:00,609
his head even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it almost has a</font>

1539
01:11:57,788 --> 01:12:05,019
rumbling sound almost a biblical sound

1540
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:10,299
at times it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also sound very</font>

1541
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:12,909
sensitive and charming and this sound

1542
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:16,960
that he has in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1543
01:12:12,908 --> 01:12:21,788
Rabbinical quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his Jewishness if</font>

1544
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:23,559
I may say so is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> what in Christian</font>

1545
01:12:21,788 --> 01:12:26,109
music would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> called bel canto or</font>

1546
01:12:23,559 --> 01:12:30,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cantus firmus the kind that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monks would</font>

1547
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:32,649
sing and that invites the addition of a

1548
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:36,760
sixth or third above or below as a

1549
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:38,029
harmony it just invites it and therefore

1550
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:44,539
complements it

1551
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:46,539
the scar

1552
01:12:44,539 --> 01:12:46,539
Oh

1553
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:53,309
my buddy

1554
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:05,679
you know Leonard's great when he has a

female singer singing behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> him it just</font>

1556
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:12,880
it complements him so well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just</font>

1557
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:15,010
remember one night there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a session</font>

1558
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,380
and I walked<font color="#CCCCCC"> into there was a coffee</font>

1559
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:19,210
room outside the studio and somebody

1560
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,739
walked in and he looked really familiar

1561
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:23,170
to me by you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was with how</font>

1562
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:27,428
some rock or something and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1563
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:28,539
studio half hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and the person</font>

1564
01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:30,940
had come in with a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

1565
01:13:28,539 --> 01:13:33,488
people and I and I looked looked at him

1566
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:36,039
and I did like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> triple take 30 minutes</font>

1567
01:13:33,488 --> 01:13:38,678
later and said that's Bob Dylan and that

1568
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:41,139
must be ronee blakley and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen</font>

1569
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:42,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ginsberg and I was I was like starstruck</font>

1570
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:45,460
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped to tell you it was a wonderful</font>

1571
01:13:42,609 --> 01:13:47,500
experience just imagine yourself to be

1572
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:50,439
in the studio with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob Dylan allen</font>

1573
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,840
ginsberg Leonard Cohen and Phil Spector

1574
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:55,569
isn't that heaven yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

1575
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,119
atmosphere was far from heaven<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spector</font>

1576
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:59,979
after years of being teetotal was

1577
01:13:58,119 --> 01:14:02,319
drinking heavily again and acting

1578
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:03,729
dictatorial<font color="#CCCCCC"> e in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the studio and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cohen</font>

1579
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:07,029
soon found that he had little control

1580
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:10,119
over the producer<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the record Phil is</font>

1581
01:14:07,029 --> 01:14:11,800
really a take-charge type of man he

1582
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:14,889
wants to be in control of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font>

1583
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:19,150
it's like an artist palette he's holding

1584
01:14:14,889 --> 01:14:21,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the brush and I would almost say like</font>

1585
01:14:19,149 --> 01:14:26,500
Leonard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colton was the subject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1586
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:28,480
so so you know Leonard wasn't a man of a

1587
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,819
lot of words in the studio Phil you know

1588
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,468
controlled the musicians and you know

1589
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:35,590
produce you know Leonard in front of the

1590
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:38,380
microphone sing and you'd essentially

1591
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:41,710
ran the show well they were both very

1592
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:43,750
comfortable there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a slight but to my</font>

1593
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:46,810
voice as you may have heard a slight

1594
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:50,079
hesitation because when an artist is

1595
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:54,880
branching out into new territory it is

1596
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:58,149
unsafe and insecure and everybody's

1597
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:01,329
finding their footing it's not familiar

1598
01:14:58,149 --> 01:15:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not the old turf and so therefore</font>

1599
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:05,439
it's a little bit frightening I got

1600
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,480
along fine with letters I got along fine

1601
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,879
with everybody I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> got along fine</font>

1602
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:12,638
with Phil but Phil couldn't get along

1603
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,609
fine with the artist it was always a

1606
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:22,500
phil was into this thing at the time

1607
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:25,440
whatever it was and he that any

1608
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:29,609
distraction would distract him a

1611
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:37,290
bothered him to that bothered leaded and

1612
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:39,119
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that really</font>

1613
01:15:37,289 --> 01:15:42,989
created a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was just never on</font>

1614
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:46,979
time it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that Columbia was</font>

1615
01:15:42,989 --> 01:15:51,449
after a different tack on how they were

1616
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:56,969
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to record Leonard I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1617
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:59,579
an unfortunate time to do it I don't

1618
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think Phil I know I wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at my best</font>

1619
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:05,640
Phil wasn't his best I don't know

1620
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:08,849
whether Leonard was but Leonard deserved

1621
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:12,030
better than he got I'm sure my main

1622
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:17,579
memory of that whole episode was that

1623
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:21,029
and Phil and Leonard were both very

1624
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:23,550
unhappy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what was coming off and I</font>

1625
01:16:21,029 --> 01:16:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">think rightly so I don't think one thing</font>

01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:29,550
fit the other the affair ended in a

1627
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:31,260
farcical manner respecter confiscating

1628
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:33,869
the final tapes and mastering them in

secret the finished work death of a

01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:43,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cohen the new audience that many had</font>

1633
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:45,479
been expecting and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> album was treated</font>

1634
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:48,149
harshly by critics it was subsequently

1635
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:52,349
disowned by cohen who called the LP a

1636
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:54,210
catastrophe the word I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> use about</font>

1637
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:57,090
death of a ladies man<font color="#E5E5E5"> is he son</font>

1638
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:58,500
dignified and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you know you</font>

1639
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:01,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really need to say much more that</font>

1640
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:04,350
that word somehow sums it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1641
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:07,769
then a cone had always been this hugely

1642
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:10,920
dignified figure he was the poet he was

1643
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:13,900
the artist he was the man who had this

1644
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:16,719
wider experience than the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

1645
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:20,738
that was what made him special and then

1646
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:23,319
this record just sucks I really thought

1647
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:25,089
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was great I really really liked the</font>

1648
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:27,340
songs I thought they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unique</font>

1649
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:29,679
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> today if you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and you try</font>

1650
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:33,219
to find music that compares<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

1651
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:36,940
album it stands on its own as one unique

1652
01:17:33,219 --> 01:17:39,399
statement of a two artists work the

1653
01:17:36,939 --> 01:17:41,139
songs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are fantastic you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine</font>

1654
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:46,658
every single one of them being done in

1655
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:48,550
concert and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done memories in all</font>

1656
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:50,079
sorts of all sorts of ways with

1657
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:51,940
different backup singers and it always

1658
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:55,529
gets a great reaction it almost gets

1659
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:55,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a great crowd pleaser</font>

1660
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:14,509
your naked body it's not typical of

1661
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:16,939
Leonard's performance style to sing the

1662
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:18,170
song he's used to standing at a

1663
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:20,269
microphone with a guitar<font color="#E5E5E5"> in his hand</font>

1664
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:24,350
when he does memories you know there's

1665
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:27,080
no guitar in 1979<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jennifer Warnes and</font>

1666
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:29,420
Sharon Robinson did a doo-wop routing

1667
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:30,890
which brought the place to think it's

1668
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:32,840
really hard for me to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

1669
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:35,270
like death of a ladies man is a bad

1670
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,920
record you know I'm somebody who's

1671
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:40,640
intrigued by whatever learn and Cohen

1672
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:44,359
does I can find things in it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1673
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:48,320
but you can you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know that</font>

1674
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:49,819
is a successful collaboration no of

1675
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,319
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's ridiculous I mean</font>

1676
01:18:49,819 --> 01:18:54,859
Leonard coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I was described it</font>

1677
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:59,869
as grotesque and I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> grotesque</font>

1678
01:18:54,859 --> 01:19:03,170
Oh on the other hand I mean what does

1679
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:04,939
Leonard Cohen want from this what is he

1680
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:08,899
going for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's a kind of</font>

1681
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:13,250
there's a garishness to it that is

1682
01:19:08,899 --> 01:19:15,500
revealing just<font color="#CCCCCC"> anime just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing to</font>

1683
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:18,680
say it's grotesque after it's done but

1684
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:20,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know that's your record</font>

1685
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah what'd you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you were going to</font>

1686
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Phil Spector for a subtlety I personally</font>

1687
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">felt that Leonard Cohen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should never use</font>

1688
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:30,170
Phil Spector you should've gone with

1689
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:34,130
David Foster because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he needs someone</font>

1690
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:36,140
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> really understands autistic people</font>

1691
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:38,720
who adeline those more about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1692
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:40,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">of performer than the field Spector so I</font>

1693
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:43,550
thought using phil was the wrong man for

1694
01:19:40,369 --> 01:19:49,279
the job even though phil was always in

1695
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:51,110
control phil<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the boss still he made</font>

1696
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:57,019
stars out of the people who work with

1697
01:19:51,109 --> 01:20:01,519
and he if he could have he would have

1698
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:05,000
made Leonard a star also but I as I say

1699
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:09,290
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think he was creatively and</font>

1700
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,420
his best at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time people refer to it</font>

1701
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:12,949
as Phil Spector's album not Leonard

1702
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,690
Cohen's album and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

1703
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:16,729
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say anything more about it that tells</font>

1704
01:20:14,689 --> 01:20:19,299
you the whole story Leonard has been

1705
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:22,689
subsumed by Spector and the

1706
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:24,820
all of sound in this first period of his

1707
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:27,638
career Cohen had resisted the temptation

1708
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:29,380
to return full time to writing and had

1709
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:32,500
passionately pursued a life in music

1710
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:34,420
with his remarkable debut his to spare

1711
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,368
Nashville masterpieces and his

1712
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:38,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">experiment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a more expansive sound</font>

1713

with John<font color="#CCCCCC"> lesueur and Phil Spector he</font>

1714
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:43,598
had demonstrated a refusal to stick to

1715
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:45,579
one mode or sound in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> later career he</font>

1716
01:20:43,599 --> 01:20:48,099
would continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve an experiment</font>

1718
01:20:48,099 --> 01:20:52,029
lay within those early albums which he

1719
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:54,729
emerged as one of the most idiosyncratic
