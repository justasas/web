Film Direction

5
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:44,659
I checked in the studio photo records.
It's definitely her.

6
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,960
Dago Film Productions

7
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,550
Present

8
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,890
The wife of an enemy of the revolution.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,140
Konstantin Khabensky

10
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,730
Where am I going to find a face like that?

11
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,689
Elizabeta Boyarskaya

12
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:17,659
Sergei Bezrukov

13
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,329
In a film by
Andrei Kravchuk

14
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,840
ADMIRAL

15
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,209
Baltic Sea, Pillau Region.
German Waters. 1916

16
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,590
Look sharp. Mines at least
seven meters from the surface!

17
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,759
82 feet under the keel.

18
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,019
85 feet under the keel.

19
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,360
- Officers on deck.
- At ease!

20
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,449
- Well?
- It's foggy.

21
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,079
No signals from the "Sentry"
or the "Hunter" for a while.

22
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,419
Try signaling them again.

23
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,629
I'll be with the division Commander.

24
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,639
Everything's calm,
Alexander Vasilievich.

25
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,729
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

26
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:18,530
That's the Kazan Mother of God,
if I'm not mistaken?

27
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,570
Sofia Fyodorovna gave it to me,
before our marriage.

28
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,370
Anna Vasilievna gave me this.

29
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,120
As a memento. Look..

30
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,420
Beautiful.

31
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,430
Beautiful.

32
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,009
Yes?

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,140
May I come in?

34
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,060
Gentlemen. Please, proceed to the bridge immediately.

35
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,319
The Germans, gentlemen.
The Germans..

36
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,070
Their 210mm cannons
against our 45s.

37
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,409
- That is "Friedrich Karl".
- So much for your "Sentry"..

38
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,790
Thank God they're quiet.

39
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,750
They've missed us.

40
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,269
All hands to battle stations!

41
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,560
All to fighting stations!

42
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,270
Battle stations! Attention!

43
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,439
- Full speed ahead!
- Full speed ahead!

44
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,279
Helmsman, full speed ahead.

45
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,750
Bear for action! Cut the ropes!

46
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,849
Hold her steady!

47
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,879
- Why have we slowed down?
- Engine room! Why have we slowed down?

48
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,800
What's happening?

49
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,469
A shell got the pipes
in the engine room!

50
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,220
- How long to fix it?
- Half an hour.

51
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,220
You have 15 minutes.

52
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,600
In 15 minutes they'll
turn us into a sieve.

53
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,480
Yes, we're a sitting duck!

54
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,279
Why have you stopped firing?

55
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,409
Midshipman!

56
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,800
Are you alive?

57
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,759
Alexander Vasilievich!
Alexander Vasilievich!

58
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,730
Should we get the orderlies?

59
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:49,779
Go to the deck-cabin.

60
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,759
Gurov, you alive?

61
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,759
Man the guns!

62
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,579
To arms!

63
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,250
To arms, I said...

64
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,139
Lads!

65
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,490
Fire!

66
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,129
- Yes!
- We got them on the main bridge!

67
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,509
They're off us now.

68
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,590
The German's bridge is damaged!

69
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,759
Relieve the gunners!

70
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,769
Third gunners to the main guns

71
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,360
Good thing we dropped the mines...

72
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,400
- What?
- I'm sorry.

73
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,740
Good that we dropped the mines,
if not...

74
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,740
Your Excellency, we've
repaired the pipes.

75
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,620
- The bridge can't be fixed quickly.
- They will the reserve one.

76
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:08,289
Let's get out of here,
while we still have time.

77
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,549
Mines, mines.

78
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,590
Full speed ahead!

79
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,509
- Head for Pillau!
- But that's our minefield!

80
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,639
Assemble the officers
on the starboard deck.

81
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,110
At attention!

82
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Gentlemen!

83
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,490
There's a German squadron behind us.
The "Friedrich Karl" is in front.

84
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,620
The way back to base in shut.

85
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,000
So I see no way out except
to lure the Germans onto our mines.

86
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,460
We head for Pillau.
Onto our minefield. Questions?

87
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:50,589
I have a question.

88
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,379
One meter from the mines!
We won't make it.

89
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,259
Our own mines. We're
digging our own graves.

90
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,470
Calm down, midshipman.

91
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,700
We're going onto the minefield.
God help us!

92
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,990
Let us pray.

93
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,080
Remove your headwear.

94
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,879
All powerful God...

95
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,379
Lord our Saviour...

96
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,600
Pardon Your faithful servants
hear and protect us...

97
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,840
- Mine at port side!
- Stop engines.

98
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,049
Ready to reverse.

99
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,970
Mine at port side!

100
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,469
Calm down, gentlemen.

101
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,820
God have mercy...

102
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,570
The Germans are opening sights.

103
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,029
Right, now they're all together.

104
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,220
Reverse.

105
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,360
We've missed the mine.

106
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,240
- That's the end..
- Goodbye, my friends.

107
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,700
They're going to finish off.

108
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,000
What a shame, gentlemen...

109
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,090
Give the order for battle.

110
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,809
Stop! As you were.

111
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,389
Slow ahead!
Previous course.

112
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,600
We're past the minefield.
Head for home, gentlemen.

113
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,200
Champagne for the captain.

114
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,790
Podgorsky, come back to us.

115
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,080
- You've already completed your dare.
- No!

116
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,289
I promised to stand until
the end of the game.

117
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,129
Russian naval base.
Helsingfors, Finland.

118
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,350
What is the dare for this one?

119
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:17,639
A new uniform!

120
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,649
Down a glass of cognac
for our victory.

121
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,730
That'll be a pleasure for him.

122
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,149
We need something more challenging!

123
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,240
Make him kiss someone.

124
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,030
The first person to come
through this door.

125
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,579
Yes! PassionateIy.
And with feeIing.

126
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,789
That's your dare,
Alexander Vasilievich.

127
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,000
- Quite a situation...
- Gentlemen, this is not funny.

128
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,500
The first through the door will be
the sailor I sent for champagne.

129
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,920
- Have you no conscience?
- That's how it is in war time:

130
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,220
Rear Admiral Kolchak
kissing a common sailor.

131
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,179
Until he comes in,
I suggest we continue.

132
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:56,929
What should this dare be?

133
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,350
- Vladimir, we're waiting.
- Attention!

134
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,230
And here's the sailor.

135
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,940
I was just Iooking for you.

136
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,570
I've been called to headquarters.
Afraid I won't be back.

137
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,829
Will you see my wife home?
As a friend. If I don't have time.

138
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,620
This is Anna Vasilievevna.
My wife.

139
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,000
I ask you...

140
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,960
What's going on here,
gentlemen?

141
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,549
Alexander Vasilievich just
took on a dare.

142
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,179
To kiss the first person
to come through the door.

143
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,259
That is, your wife.

144
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,310
So off you go to your watch.

145
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,889
Alexander Vasilievich.
We implore you...

146
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,310
You ought to honour it!

147
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,689
Rules of the game -
Like service regulations!

148
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,610
Come on Annushka, it's just a dare!

149
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,080
You really should obey!

150
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,830
Dares are more serious
than card debts.

151
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,629
Ladies and gentlemen.
Your attention please!

152
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,299
- Slavushka, run off and play.
- All right, papa.

153
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,890
Volodya, see what a
ship I have!

154
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,530
I'm starting to believe in fate,
Anna Vasilievna.

155
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:00,990
Today, when I came to
Helsingfors,

156
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,490
for some reason
I was sure

157
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,289
that I would meet you.

158
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,289
Really?

159
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,960
Yes, indeed.

160
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,759
Sonechka, do you remember
when we Ieft Moscow so suddenly?

161
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Your father had the bad luck
to fall in love.

162
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:22,809
Why are you telling me this?

163
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,930
Your neighbour - she is just
too beautiful.

164
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:33,519
Sasha is prone to infatuation.
But it never lasts long.

165
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,070
Yes, and I wanted to ask,

166
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,039
There'll be a ball at the
Podgorsky tomorrow. Are you coming?

167
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:10,599
Kirill Fyodorovich,
come over here!

168
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,990
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:34,209
Why on earth do you have
to entangle all these balls of yarn?

170
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,380
How did the Tsars
choose their brides?

171
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,510
The brides would untangle a yarn.
The Tsar watched through the keyhole.

172
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,430
If a girl fidgeted, or lost her temper,
that was it.

173
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,390
Out you go, lazybones!

174
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,600
That's because Tsar's wife

175
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:53,649
must have angel patience,
and self-restraint.

176
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,359
That's how my grandmother
prepared me to be a bride.

177
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,490
Interesting.

178
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,529
And why did your grandmother
call you a Shelkova village cossack?

179
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,490
Because I am a Shelkova woman.

180
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,830
Our Cossacks married Turkish women.

181
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,579
I have Turkish blood too.

182
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,880
So, let's drink to the Turks!

183
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,920
With pleasure.

184
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,509
- Mama, is father an Admiral?
- A rear-Admiral.

185
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,310
Better if he'd stayed a captain.

186
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,559
I Iike him as a captain better.
Rear-Admiral is hard to say.

187
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,740
Better if you got some sleep.

188
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,369
Go to sleep, my dear.

189
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,039
You won't go swimming
again with father.

190
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,670
So what did you find out?

191
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,510
It turns out, these
Turkish ladies from the harems,

192
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,420
would not give anyone anything!

193
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,350
A traveler comes along,
and asks for a glass of water.

194
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,519
What does the lady of the house reply?

195
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,889
"When Ivan comes, he will
give it to you, traveler".

196
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,480
Slander! Slander and calumny!

197
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,110
I for one would never
turn you down.

198
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,650
I fear, Anna Vasilievna, you
would have your hands full.

199
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm very partial to drinking.

200
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,870
I understand you perfectly.

201
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,039
Generally speaking, it seems to me that

202
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,539
water and war are the only

203
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,839
loves in your life.

204
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,510
It seems to me you know
perfectly well -

205
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,589
that's not how it is.

206
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,230
Well.

207
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,320
It's getting late.

208
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,819
We had a nice walk,

209
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,909
and now it's time to go.

210
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,079
Who knows, Anna Vasilievna -

211
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:15,369
whether we'll ever have such a
good time as we did today?

212
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,289
Thank you... dear
Alexander Vasilievich.

213
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:25,669
Go now, go.

214
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,099
This is the light signal of
a sinking ship, Anna Vasilievna.

215
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:43,069
Good night.

216
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,289
I was thinking that something had happened:

217
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,250
Sasha...

218
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,840
Is everything all right between us?

219
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,430
Not exactIy.

220
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,309
Tell me if this is - but...

221
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,519
Are you sure this is serious?

222
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,779
I don't know...

223
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,289
I have no intention of getting in your way,

224
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,629
Slavushka, Mother and
I will leave. To St. - Petersburg.

225
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,250
Sonya, I...

226
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,469
You don't need to go anywhere.

227
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,519
Everything will be all right. I promise.

228
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,610
You are my wife and I am your husband.
That's how it will always be.

229
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,789
How is Slavushka?

230
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,629
His temperature is nearly normal.
Shall I wait for you at lunch?

231
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,799
No, I'll be dining at the Assembly.

232
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,730
Alexander Vasilievich, congratulations
on your new assignment!

233
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,859
What a brilliant career!

234
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,509
No, I understand well that you can't force

235
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,809
someone to love or hate
against his or her will.

236
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,350
- But we took vows before God.
- So what?

237
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,360
You swore before God,

238
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,650
to love me and remain faithful.
You understand perfectly well that...

239
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,609
Remain faithful - what do you mean?

240
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,069
Not go to bed with someone else?

241
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,700
If that's what you mean, I haven't
been unfaithful to you.

242
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,710
God, you're still such a child...

243
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,470
I don't understand.

244
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,099
What on earth are you doing here?

245
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,539
Nikolai, tell headquarters
that the mining operation is

246
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,170
complete and there are no losses.
We're heading back to base.

247
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,799
Thank you for your service, gentlemen.

248
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:23,970
Alexander Vasilievich, please submit
my report to the Naval Command.

249
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,019
- What is this report?
- I request a transfer to another ship.

250
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,529
Have we let you down somehow,
Sergei Nikolaevich?

251
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,660
Rear-Admiral, Sir,

252
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,370
a radio message from the coast.
From prince Melikov. To all at sea.

253
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,929
Ragotsem Cape, Gulf of Riga, 1916

254
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,230
- A communications buoy ahead.
- Stop the engines.

255
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,480
- Engines stopped.
- Drop anchor!

256
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,529
Your Excellency.

257
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,400
We received a radiogram.

258
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,820
- "I arrived with the "Glory". Kolchak".
- Go.

259
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,470
The cable is connected.
The communication is established.

260
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:47,390
Alexander Vasilievich, we're
connected with the coast.

261
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,309
Man the starboard battle stations.

262
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,269
Man the battle stations.

263
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,729
Hurry!

264
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,740
This is the commander of cruiser the "Glory",
Rear-Admiral Kolchak.

265
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,450
The situation is critical. The Germans
are pressing us on the right flank.

266
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,760
I will coordinate your
firing operation myself.

267
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,259
Grid thirty. Coordinates.

268
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,140
Three thousand five hundred.
Two thousand two hundred.

269
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,470
Battle stations! Man the guns!

270
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,650
Sight eighteen.
Deflection forty three.

271
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,320
Fire!

272
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:44,990
Fire!

273
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,039
Twenty more to the left. Three higher..

274
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:01,000
The Germans are turning their guns!

275
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:13,929
Hallo! Hallo!

276
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,390
Hallo!? I can't hear you.

277
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,940
Man the guns! In pIace!

278
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,529
The Germans have opened fire on us.

279
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,569
- So?
- We're a sitting duck now.

280
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:32,160
- We need to head out the sea.
- Then how do I adjust the fire?!

281
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,700
We're staying in place.
Check the communication!

282
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,019
Are you wounded?

283
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,650
Let me help... This is not the time
or place, Sergei Nikolaevich.

284
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:09,069
But as a military officer you surprised
me with your report.

285
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,240
To leave your comrades with whom
you have served so long.

286
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,579
Given the personal situation that has
arisen between the two of us.

287
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:18,500
What situation?

288
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,500
The onIy situation now is war -

289
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,500
fighting the enemy and doing
your duty to the homeland. Yes!

290
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:32,180
Rear-Admiral Kolchak. What are
your new firing coordinates?

291
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,299
Ten to the Ieft and five higher!

292
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,890
Open fire!

293
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:57,240
Mates! Attack! Hurray!

294
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,230
Stop! Stop!

295
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,490
Here is a letter in Morse code.

296
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,490
I did my best with a textbook at home.

297
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,579
Thank you. But today is the
last time we shall see each other.

298
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
We can't meet again.

299
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,230
What happened?

300
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,360
Did we do something wrong?

301
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:10,269
Anna Vasilievna...

302
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,830
We didn't even dance.

303
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:23,579
Why AIexander Vasilievich?

304
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:27,710
Because I Iove you.

305
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,960
Farewell!

306
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,379
Alexander Vasilievich.

307
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,059
Give me the letter.

308
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,260
My darling Annushka! You're all drenched.

309
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,849
Be careful or you'll fall ill.

310
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,700
I'm very tired.

311
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,369
Sure Annushka, I...

312
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,670
Mogilev, the Emperor's
General Headquarters

313
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,470
The Emperor will see you here in the park.

314
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:06,429
- I wish you health, Your Majesty.
- Greetings.

315
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,230
I have been told of your bravery.

316
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,769
Of the courage you showed
on the Baltic Sea.

317
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:16,400
I acted according to the call
of duty, Your Majesty.

318
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,320
I invited you here to inform
you of our decision.

319
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:25,949
You have been assigned
the rank of Vice-Admiral,

320
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:30,209
and become the Commander-in-Chief
of the Black Sea fleet.

321
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:32,500
Thank you for your trust,
Your Majesty.

322
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,300
Take this, and may the icon

323
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,640
of the long-suffering Job
give you strength.

324
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:46,349
Thank you.

325
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:52,019
I wish you luck!

326
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,269
Allow me to take my leave,
Your Majesty.

327
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,739
Godspeed, admiral.

328
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,059
"I must know that you're alive ".

329
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,860
Cabman!

330
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,869
To the train station!
Faster, please...

331
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,550
Gentlemen...

332
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,010
to buy Alexander Vasilievich
protection - from the sun!

333
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:11,349
- It's like a resort area there.
- Sevastopol is not Baltics.

334
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:18,809
When are you going there,
Sophia Fyodorovna?

335
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,629
Tea, gentlemen.

336
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:54,389
This is your fleet!

337
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,910
Yesterday I was walking by Mikhailovsky
castle when I heard children arguing:

338
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,369
"Mine, give it me", "No"...

339
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:22,210
Then all of a sudden it
became crystal clear to me.

340
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,670
"Everything will come in due time.
It already has come".

341
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,930
There is no more mine or yours.

342
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:35,059
Every morning I open my eyes
and smile... I'm alive...

343
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:40,150
I am waiting... This is a reward,

344
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:41,769
not a punishment.

345
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,570
Because against all the laws
of physics you give,

346
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,900
the more you give
the more you receive.

347
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:52,990
Just imagine,
I can feel in my hands

348
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,539
a big and unbelievabIy
shiny ball.

349
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:00,539
This is Grace.

350
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,670
A gift...

351
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,380
Happiness... That's the
way it is.

352
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,340
Don't laugh. I know.

353
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,220
I stand on the edge
of a vast unseen world.

354
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:18,389
And although we see the future
unclearly, as the Apostle said:

355
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,480
"Through a glass darkly...

356
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:23,519
And now abideth faith,

357
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,690
hope and love.

358
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,450
But the greatest of these is love".

359
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,869
Alexander Vasilievich,

360
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,619
I heard that you
will be in Petrograd...

361
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:43,789
How soon? March, April?

362
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,010
For some reason it seems
to me that it won't be long.

363
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,720
May I come in? Your Excellency,
a wireless message just came in.

364
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,180
On March 2nd the Emperor Nicholas
the Second abdicated the throne.

365
00:39:57,389 --> 00:40:00,940
Power is with
the Provisional Government...

366
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,230
The monarchy has fallen.

367
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,410
A Provisional Government...

368
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,280
What does that mean?

369
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,200
I don't think it bodes
at all well for Russia.

370
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:26,590
I think you're right.

371
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,630
Anna Vasilievna, unfortunately...

372
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,550
Kronstadt, 1917

373
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,180
The revolution has eclipsed our future.

374
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,640
The darkness is approaching.

375
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,940
- Where are you taking us?
- Wherever...

376
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:56,069
Gentlemen, are we just
a herd of animals?

377
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,199
- We should do something!
- Hands off, sailor!

378
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,159
Please, obey.

379
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,079
It's a treason.

380
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:11,340
- Listen to my command.
- My God!

381
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,800
We're at war. Come to your senses!
What are you doing?

382
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,050
- Sort out the Admiral.
- Fear the Lord.

383
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:24,139
Gentlemen! Save yourselves,
that's an order!

384
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,190
- Run!
- Shoot them...

385
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:03,139
Kolya!

386
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,900
May God be with you!

387
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:46,019
Sevastopol

388
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,280
Annushka, good you're
home. Pack your bags.

389
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:06,369
- What happened, Serezha?
- Admiral Nepenin has been killed!

390
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,539
- How did he die?
- I said he was killed!

391
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:14,799
He was clubbed with rifle butts
and stabbed with bayonets. Brutes!

392
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,969
Serezha, I can't understand
what's happening.

393
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,550
God! What on earth
is happening?

394
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,760
Serezhenka, calm down, explain.

395
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,179
Podgorsky has also been killed.
He died in my arms.

396
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,400
Out of the way!

397
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,820
- What's the matter?
- The first order...

398
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,829
...of the Petrograd Soviet

399
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,160
is for all officers
to hand over weapons.

400
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:51,539
To prevent a counter-revolutionary
conspiracy.

401
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,289
Turn in your weapon, Admiral.

402
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,420
- We're leaving for Petrograd...
- Why are we leaving?

403
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,139
- I was able to take some leave...
- Wait a minute!

404
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:10,139
What are you waiting for?
Pack your bags...

405
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,400
Admiral, follow
this order immediately.

406
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:17,730
- Get out of here!
- Listen here, Admiral..

407
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,440
Get out!

408
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,780
All right men,
we'll figure this out on deck.

409
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:30,369
Officer of the watch, tell everyone
to line up on deck.

410
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:33,210
Wait, Serezha, how can I...
how can I go...

411
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,000
All letters come to this address.
I'm waiting...

412
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,920
At least close your suitcase?

413
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,549
Anya. Anya,

414
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:57,900
Anechka, please my dear. I'm begging you.

415
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,070
The boat leaves in half an hour.

416
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,950
We're finished
if we don't make it on time.

417
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,010
Arms!

418
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,769
As you were!

419
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,150
Attention! Align up the crew!

420
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,530
- Fall in!
- Who are you obeying?

421
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:48,449
- You afraid, lads!
- Fall in!

422
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,659
Quick.

423
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:55,409
Officers, gentlemen.

424
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:01,750
- Weapons up.
- I'm sorry!

425
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,760
At ease.

426
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,640
To avoid bloodshed,

427
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,469
I order the officers

428
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,889
to turn in their weapons.

429
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:39,710
Admiral, sir, your weapon...

430
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,500
Sir...

431
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:41,730
Petrograd

432
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,160
Come with us, lady... Let's go!

433
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,789
You weren't home today.
I got the mail and there is a

434
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,670
letter for you.
From Sevastopol.

435
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,430
It's strange that mail
still arrives.

436
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,309
I'm feeling tired today.

437
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,610
In three days I'll be in Petrograd.

438
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:26,519
Seeing you is all I'm dreaming of.

439
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,940
Sevastopol

440
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,070
Hearing your voice.

441
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,950
- Kerensky has summoned me.
- It's dangerous in Petrograd...

442
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,120
the sailors and workers
have rebelled.

443
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,750
Admiral Nepenin was stabbed
to death with a bayonet.

444
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,289
- Can I see you to the station?
- Sonya, I...

445
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,380
Rostislav is waiting for you.
Go to him.

446
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,490
- Will you come back?
- Of course.

447
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,659
What silly thoughts.

448
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,409
PETROGRAD

449
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,469
Kerensky wants to offer you
the post of war minister...

450
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:40,139
We'll see. I wish he wouId
see me on time.

451
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:41,889
But he is coming late.

452
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,190
Today...

453
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,240
at the Mikhailovsky Castle...

454
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,199
Today...

455
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,579
I can see we have a different
view of the war...

456
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:09,630
By condoning anarchy
you have broken up the army...

457
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,550
- ... and destroyed the Russian navy.
- Don't you forget yourseIf?...

458
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,130
Unless I have authority
to impose strict order

459
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,550
your proposals
are unacceptable to me.

460
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,140
Former procedures in the army
are not acceptable to us.

461
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,519
I was the first to swear allegiance

462
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,070
and I'll be the first
to leave the Navy.

463
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,070
In this way,
I will make a public statement

464
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,780
that the current state of affairs
is ruinous for Russia.

465
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,090
I accept your resignation.

466
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,380
I am honoured.

467
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,550
You should be arrested for your
counter-revolutionary leanings.

468
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,640
But given your merits,
I offer you to go to America.

469
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,269
I'm giving you the chance to
continue the war against Germany.

470
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,980
Are you exiling me from Russia?

471
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,320
The Americans need an expert who can

472
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,910
conduct a landing
and seize Constantinople.

473
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:26,869
My family is still in Sevastopol.

474
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:29,210
I'll take care of them.

475
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:33,789
I'll ask the allies to have
them brought to you overseas.

476
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,170
Thank you.

477
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,860
Dear...

478
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,780
My darling, Anna Vasilievna.

479
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:03,619
You are my happiness.

480
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,829
How will I live without you...

481
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:14,960
What?

482
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:31,389
Their times are over!

483
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:47,829
- I'm leaving Russia.
- Why?

484
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:55,960
How tired you look...

485
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,960
I love you.

486
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,760
And I always will.

487
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:12,480
Forgive me.

488
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,519
Farewell,

489
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,610
Alexander Vasilievich.

490
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,579
I know that you are alive.

491
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,410
Sevastopol

492
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,530
Is it ready?

493
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:15,209
At least let us pray.

494
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,210
Pray if you want to.

495
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,720
Listen, bring the rope.

496
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:13,219
Let's go while he draws the
sailors away!

497
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:16,849
Stop!

498
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,110
Quick, Iet's go...
we can't wait for him here

499
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:31,909
Stop!

500
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:43,000
Mrs. Kolchak! Open the
door, Mrs. Kolchak!

501
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,210
Document check!

502
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,760
Break it down!

503
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:53,889
Break the windows!

504
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,360
It's time, the British ship
sets sail in an hour.

505
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,309
A YEAR LATER. AUTUMN 1918.
TRANS-SIBERIA RAILWAY

506
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:42,769
I think I'm doing it better.

507
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:44,690
Take your place.

508
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,110
What a good shot!

509
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,329
Let's drink to our wishes.

510
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,880
Even the ones that don't come true?

511
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:11,550
Does that make them
any less wishes.

512
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,519
- Excuse me, Madam.
- Yes, of course.

513
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,690
- Mikhail Ivanovich.
- Anna Vasilievna!

514
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:31,900
- My God!
- What a surprise!

515
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:42,289
I haven't seen you for a year...
What brings you here?

516
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:48,750
Sergei Nikolaevich has been
sent to the Far East.

517
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,170
He's on a mission to
disarm the Pacific fleet.

518
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,800
Sergei Nikolaevich?

519
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:57,889
...So he's in power now?

520
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:02,019
- A red commissar.
- I have no right to judge him.

521
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:03,980
At a time like this.

522
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:06,730
It's the same time for everyone.

523
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:13,610
- Where are you going?
- To Omsk.

524
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:18,070
But the Soviets are in
power there too?

525
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,200
No. Kolchak is there.

526
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:32,750
But I thought Alexander
Vasilievich was abroad?

527
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,550
Kerensky did send him abroad.

528
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:39,719
But after the Bolshevik coup
he returned to Russia

529
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:41,349
to fight the Bolsheviks.

530
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,970
I'm sorry, Anna Vasilievna,
I must go.

531
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,349
Goodbye.

532
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:28,769
Serezha...

533
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:31,519
Aha... yes... yes, Anya!
What is it?

534
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:36,230
Kolchak is in Omsk
gathering an army.

535
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:41,110
Anya, if this is a rebuke,
you know I agreed to collaborate

536
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:45,159
with the authorities because
they allowed us

537
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:47,869
to go far away from

538
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:50,869
this fratricidal madness...

539
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:53,289
To Japan, China...

540
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,380
It's all for your sake, Anechka.

541
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,550
I don't blame you for anything.

542
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,390
But I love Alexander
Vasilievich, Serezha.

543
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,560
and now I need to be with him...

544
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,809
I realize that these are harsh words,

545
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,440
but I have never
stopped loving him.

546
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,780
I see!... Stop, stop...

547
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,289
Let me help.

548
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:40,210
So there it is. A time of wars
and revolutions.

549
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:44,219
Anything goes.

550
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,259
The time has nothing
to do with it.

551
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:52,980
When I fell asleep I
was your husband.

552
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,059
I woke up and I am
no longer your husband.

553
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,400
I know it's hard for you

554
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:05,819
but you've got to be strong.

555
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:09,949
You'll forget me before long.

556
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:13,459
Let me be the one
to decide that.

557
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,680
Siberia, Eastern Front.
November 1918

558
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:37,690
I pledge and swear

559
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,480
before Almighty God,

560
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:44,860
His Holy Gospel
and the Life-Giving Cross:

561
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:50,539
to be faithful and ever true
to the Russian state

562
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:53,119
as my Homeland.

563
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:58,500
I pledge and swear

564
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,050
to serve it as the Supreme Ruler of Russia,

565
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,600
without regard for my life,

566
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:15,769
family ties or friendship,

567
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:17,980
enmity, or gain,

568
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,400
and mindful only of the revival

569
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:26,900
and success of the Russian state.

570
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:36,000
Hereby I make the sign
of the cross,

571
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:40,589
and kiss the words and
Cross of my Saviour.

572
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,710
Amen.

573
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,240
Omsk

574
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,010
Hello, my lady!

575
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:33,299
Who are you looking for?

576
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,190
You, I think.

577
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,230
How can I help you?

578
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:47,650
I'm the one who would
like to help you.

579
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,760
My dear,

580
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,050
sweet...

581
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,140
Alexander Vasilievich,

582
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,010
I have realized that I simply
can no longer wait!

583
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:23,099
Do you remember how I dreamed
to be on the deck of your ship?

584
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,190
Just to see you.

585
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,280
You would not even notice me,
I would not disturb you;

586
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:32,279
all I need is to stand nearby.

587
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,790
And now it seems that I will
experience this happiness.

588
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,460
Take joy in your victories.

589
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:46,460
Our troops are already
moving towards the Volga.

590
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,420
And God willing,

591
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,880
we will all see Moscow soon.

592
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:55,930
And I will know that

593
01:04:56,929 --> 01:05:02,019
I have played a small part
in all of this.

594
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:06,360
I congratulate you, General,
on a successful operation.

595
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,860
Thank you...

596
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,280
Not only my achievement,
but the entire army...

597
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:14,609
Nothing can lift spirits
of the soldiers as an attack.

598
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,450
I heard from the Allies that

599
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:21,449
they're about to recognize your government

600
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:23,659
as the only legitimate one in Russia...

601
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:27,210
Whatever laws we pass we'll still be shot,

602
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,460
if we lose this war.

603
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,590
My heart swells with pride for you

604
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,510
and all who are fighting beside you

605
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,179
for the revival of Russia...

606
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:39,719
We need to build on our success
and continue the offensive in all directions.

607
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:45,849
Your goal is to reach Ufa.
Good luck, general. Godspeed!

608
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:48,610
More than a year has gone by

609
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,030
since the last time we met.

610
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:57,569
Your Excellency.

611
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:00,200
General Janin from
the Allies has arrived.

612
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:04,869
After all the changes we've been through

613
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:06,829
I was wondering how you would...

614
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,460
I... I'm afraid even
to think about this.

615
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,720
Most of all I'm afraid to place
you in an awkward situation

616
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:19,509
because of my unexpected arrival.

617
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:25,179
General Janin, our allies France and Britain

618
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:27,349
Have given you the rank
of Head Commander.

619
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:30,059
And you are the Supreme Commander of Russia.

620
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:32,690
Put it over here, bring the hot water!

621
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,110
A foreigner cannot command
the Russian army.

622
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,790
Do you invite me to command
the Czech prisoners of war

623
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,579
who guard the railway?

624
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:49,460
It is a strategic object.

625
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,380
From now, you are commander

626
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:56,470
of the allied Czech forces.

627
01:06:56,670 --> 01:07:01,220
- I thank you, Admiral.
- I thank you, General Janin.

628
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:16,190
All I need to know is that you
are in the world.

629
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,740
That nothing bad has
happened to you.

630
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,780
To see you sometimes,
even from afar.

631
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:27,460
If only you knew how
I am tempted to come

632
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:32,000
and see you so we could talk.

633
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,300
My love for you is

634
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,130
even greater than before.

635
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,220
I've been writing this letter
to you for so many days

636
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:46,219
and I still cannot bring
myself to send it.

637
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:47,599
Your Excellency!

638
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:49,940
I welcome you to our city!

639
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:52,059
Accept this bread and salt
as our hospitality.

640
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,700
The geese saved Rome and you
have saved our city.

641
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,240
Here you are, your Excellency...

642
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,990
It's a good thing it's
not a cow, gentlemen!

643
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:11,579
Write it down as a gift.

644
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,550
Officers and soldiers of the Russian army!

645
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:26,010
Ladies and gentlemen!

646
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,430
Perm, Ekaterinburg and Elabuga

647
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,560
have been taken.

648
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:36,569
General Kappel recently took Ufa

649
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:39,189
in battle.

650
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:41,319
We're only about 100
versts away

651
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:45,319
from Denikin's armies.

652
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:49,500
The Reds have broken the front in three places.
The First and the Second armies have been defeated.

653
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:53,039
Together with them we shall
move on Moscow!

654
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,880
Go.

655
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:11,770
As the Apostle Paul said:

656
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,600
"For now we see

657
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:21,400
through a glass darkly...

658
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:24,949
And now abideth faith,

659
01:09:25,489 --> 01:09:27,869
hope and love... "

660
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,550
May God help us!

661
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:45,180
You are starting to recover.
God is merciful.

662
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,970
There are rumours that
there will be evacuation.

663
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,180
Where are we going to load the wounded?
Anna Vasilievna,

664
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,480
you should speak with him:
well, about the rail wagons.

665
01:09:57,979 --> 01:10:00,939
- Are the Reds so close?
- Haven't you heard the cannons?

666
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:04,649
There are not enough cars
for the wounded.

667
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,119
Kolchak can't think about them.
You should have reminded him.

668
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:12,579
Vera, it's impossible.

669
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,369
Besides, we were not that close.

670
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,710
Who will listen to me?
But you are a lady.

671
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,340
They will listen to you
and kiss your hand.

672
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,720
I don't know

673
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:30,010
how to act as a petitioner.

674
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:33,470
Come on, my dear,
it would be easy for you.

675
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:35,979
Ladies,

676
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,360
they brought some
wounded officers. By revolted soldiers.

677
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:42,519
Let's go.

678
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:47,399
There are pockets of resistance
even in the far rear.

679
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:49,199
It's worse at the front,

680
01:10:49,569 --> 01:10:53,079
not to mention the constant lack
of ammunition and provisions.

681
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:55,579
The Reds have crossed the Tobol River.

682
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,920
Omsk can never surrender.

683
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,880
Losing Omsk means
losing the army.

684
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,260
We can't risk the army.

685
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:15,310
Gentlemen! There can only be one decision.

686
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,140
To fight with our last force
to save Omsk.

687
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,810
Yes. Of course.

688
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:25,569
I swear before God! I am with you!

689
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:28,609
Kappel's army is still trying
to keep back the Bolsheviks,

690
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:36,369
Giving up Omsk -
That would be the disaster!

691
01:11:36,789 --> 01:11:38,619
Excuse me, gentlemen.

692
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:44,460
I'm from the front, so no time
to make myself more presentable.

693
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,010
- May I report?
- Yes.

694
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:51,050
Bad news, gentlemen. Treason.

695
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,310
The second Ukrainian regiment has
defected

696
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:57,730
and abandoned the central front.

697
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,270
The Reds are moving towards Omsk.

698
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,650
They will be here in another week or two.

699
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,859
That's how it is, gentlemen.

700
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:12,869
It's your decision,
Sir Supreme Ruler.

701
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:25,840
I declare Irkutsk to be
the seat of power.

702
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,840
I order the evacuation
from Omsk to begin.

703
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,890
We will make this sacrifice
to save the army. To carry on...

704
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:34,930
Omsk, november 1919

705
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,140
...our struggle against the Bolsheviks.

706
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:40,430
I'm not letting you through!
Move aside!

707
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,039
The Prime Minister's office
will be in carriage B.

708
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,750
Viktor Nikolaevich, how is loading
transportation of the wounded proceeding..

709
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,920
This is where the Executive Office
will be located.

710
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,420
And the last compartment
will be used for telegraph calls.

711
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,180
Alexander Vasilievich.

712
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,640
Could you come here
for a minute?

713
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,850
What?

714
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:26,060
I think I just saw Anna Vasilievna here.

715
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:45,670
Alexander Vasilievich,

716
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,210
the medical cars are completely full.
No room even for minor injuries.

717
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,970
- Open the carriage.
- I can't.

718
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,800
- Make room in the second car.
- The merchants boarded are in there.

719
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,350
- They paid.
- Did you hear my order?

720
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,940
- It's up to you...
- Carry the wounded.

721
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:12,399
Would you like them to lie
in the snow?!

722
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:16,319
- Do as you... They're frozen.
- Carriage full.

723
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:23,699
Dear Anna Vasilievna.

724
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,420
Once I made an unforgivable
mistake in parting from you.

725
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:29,920
I never want to make
the same mistake again.

726
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,760
I... Will you come along with me?

727
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,920
In the same carriage.

728
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,100
I'm not sure if you'll agree
to remain always by my side

729
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,470
from now on. Morning and evening.
Otherwise I...

730
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:47,730
I can't go on without you...

731
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,520
My sweet dearest Anna Vasilievna!

732
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:01,489
No room! Where are you going?!

733
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:12,630
Paris, France, 1919

734
01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:53,289
"How Iong will the Supreme Ruler
of Russia continue to retreat?"

735
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,970
"The Ruler of Russia abandoned Omsk.
Has Kolchak lost the war to the Bolsheviks?"

736
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:13,359
Trans-Siberian railroad.
470 km to Irkutsk

737
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:26,829
Merry Christmas.

738
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:32,960
Where is your ring, Anna Vasilievna?

739
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:40,420
I haven't worn it for a while -
and you didn't notice.

740
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,100
Anna Vasilievna, there is something

741
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,810
I need to tell you.

742
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,069
Today I wrote a letter to Sophia Federovna.

743
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:00,609
I asked her for a divorce.

744
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:05,739
I don't know how much time
the Lord has left me,

745
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:09,199
but I want to be honest
with her until the end.

746
01:17:09,409 --> 01:17:14,579
Tell me... will you be my wife?

747
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,480
Alexander Vasilievich...

748
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:39,859
We're together at last.

749
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:42,279
Isn't that enough?

750
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:49,159
Anna Vasilievna, I asked you
a very clear question.

751
01:17:52,949 --> 01:17:55,460
Why do you remain silent?

752
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,300
We haven't even said our Chirstmas toast.

753
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,220
What happened?

754
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:15,690
Nizhneudinsk station.
450 km to Irkutsk

755
01:18:19,149 --> 01:18:22,359
- Mama, Iook it's the Czechs!
- Step back!

756
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,069
It's the Allies!..

757
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:38,460
Merry Christmas.
Greetings, Anna Vasilievna

758
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:42,130
- Why have we stopped again?
- The Czechs have delayed us.

759
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:46,380
The bastards are moving
their 20,000 cars

760
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:47,970
stuffed full of junk

761
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:49,760
and then perhaps it will be our turn.

762
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:53,310
They are completely brazen!
Convoy - to the arms!

763
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:14,199
Stand aside!

764
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:25,630
Major! Stopping the Ruler's
train is an act of treason...

765
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,300
The Admiral told the
convoy to take up arms.

766
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:30,300
It's an order from
General Janin...

767
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:34,890
General Janin obey
the orders of Admiral Kolchak.

768
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:37,560
Who is the Supreme Ruler of Russia.

769
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,360
Mr. Prime Minister.

770
01:19:45,069 --> 01:19:46,779
There is an uprising in Irkutsk.

771
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:50,609
You have nowhere to go.
Please let me pass.

772
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,739
Kappel's army is moving
after us

773
01:19:54,989 --> 01:19:57,789
and we are prepared to
quell any resistance.

774
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,460
- May I come in?
- Certainly.

775
01:20:00,869 --> 01:20:02,880
There is a telegram from Kappel...
from Kulomzino.

776
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,550
Bypassed Kulomzino. Heading straight.

777
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:12,590
Quick! Put me through
to General Kappel!

778
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:18,730
Your army must reach
Irkutsk at all costs!

779
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:22,020
The city is rebelling.
I am heading there now.

780
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:27,150
Discharge your duty honorabIy!
Thank you!

781
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:32,779
My horse!

782
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,289
Why have they stopped firing?

783
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,750
We're out of ammunition!

784
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,760
Your Excellency,
we're out of ammunition.

785
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,760
- Run to Lozhkin and get some!
- None there either!

786
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:15,319
Lieutenant-General Voytsekhovsky
with an advance detachment...

787
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:20,409
We're being pressed on the left flank.
And we are out of ammunition.

788
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,289
You may go.

789
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:26,880
- What about communications?
- We can't... Line's cut.

790
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,130
Keep trying!

791
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:43,230
- Answer, headquarters...
- Headquarters here.

792
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,730
Vladimir, how did you get here?

793
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:49,319
Everything is under fire. Why have
you ceased the offensive?

794
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,650
What offensive? We haven't
got a single bullet left.

795
01:22:01,539 --> 01:22:05,539
I received Kolchak's telephonogram.

796
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:08,539
There's a rebellion in Irkutsk.
We must free the city.

797
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,960
We'll get through to the Admiral.
Only we can save the city.

798
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,510
We need to attack.

799
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,010
- Is the main army on the way?
-We'll be dead when they arrive.

800
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,600
Prepare for battle. We have
no other option. Time is running out.

801
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:28,399
Sergei Nikolaevich, tell
the men to line up.

802
01:22:38,489 --> 01:22:41,659
Officers and soldiers!

803
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:47,369
Lads... We have nowhere to get
ammunition. To hell with it!

804
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:51,710
God is with us!
And with God and prayer

805
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,300
we have always defeated the
enemy and we will go on doing so!

806
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,510
All is in God's hands.

807
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,890
If we are destined to die
we will go down with honour!

808
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:04,850
We will go down with honour!
It's do or die now!

809
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:11,770
To faith, to the Homeland,
Bayonets ahead - forward march!

810
01:23:11,979 --> 01:23:14,609
Attach bayonets!

811
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:22,579
Vladimir Oskarovich, you can't.
You're leading the army.

812
01:23:23,369 --> 01:23:25,829
Where are the musicians?!
Army Music! QuickIy!

813
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:28,039
Music, I said!

814
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:31,039
Musicians - forward, march!

815
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,989
CIose formation!

816
01:24:43,529 --> 01:24:45,779
Into fire!

817
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,060
Lads - advance!

818
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,640
Music! Faster! Forward!

819
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,400
Hooray!

820
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:22,989
- Eh, you got shot a woman...
- Bastards!

821
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:43,800
Get back!

822
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:54,310
Forgive us Lord out of your great mercy,
we pray to you, hear our prayers.

823
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:02,609
Are we going to lay the Reds
by the Whites?

824
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:03,859
Together.

825
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:06,609
We are all Gods people.

826
01:26:06,989 --> 01:26:09,699
God didn't paint them
in different colours.

827
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,340
Irkutsk. General Janin's
control headquarters

828
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,390
Greetings!

829
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,230
I understand...

830
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:20,399
that you cannot suppress
the riot in Irkutsk.

831
01:27:20,609 --> 01:27:21,939
General Janin!

832
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:23,819
The situation is difficult.

833
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:25,529
You must ensure

834
01:27:25,819 --> 01:27:27,239
that my convoy reaches Irkutsk.

835
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:29,029
The Czechs reject

836
01:27:29,239 --> 01:27:30,699
all their obligations as Allies.

837
01:27:30,909 --> 01:27:32,369
They have declared neutrality

838
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:33,789
and are evacuating.

839
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:35,909
They are tired and angry.

840
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:37,909
Admiral, the railway

841
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,960
has already been
taken by partisans.

842
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,630
My garrison is blockaded there,

843
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,550
I have to go!

844
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,340
The Reds won't touch you,

845
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,050
if you go to Irkutsk

846
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,850
with the Czechs.

847
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,680
The outcome of the war depends on

848
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:57,270
how soon I will be in Irkutsk.

849
01:27:57,479 --> 01:27:59,389
You must believe me.

850
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,900
I give you the word of an officer.

851
01:28:02,109 --> 01:28:04,189
I guarantee your safety.

852
01:28:08,989 --> 01:28:12,819
Only the convoy officers
will accompany me to Irkutsk.

853
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:17,119
All other ranks will remain with
their convoy in Nizhneudinsk.

854
01:28:17,409 --> 01:28:19,619
Nizhneudinsk train station.
450 km to Irkutsk

855
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,220
Mr. Udintsov, it's time to go.

856
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,180
Yes, officers, please enter the carriage.

857
01:28:50,819 --> 01:28:52,489
Admiral, I would ask you

858
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:58,369
not to leave the car at stations
and not to stand by the windows.

859
01:28:58,579 --> 01:29:01,289
Tell nobody about your whereabouts.

860
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:04,380
- This is like being under arrest.
- No, sir Admiral.

861
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:08,170
The workers are rebelling.
They demand to hand you over.

862
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:41,619
Trans-Siberian railroad.
400 km to Irkutsk

863
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:49,000
I wish we could just move on and on...

864
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,170
You know, Anna Vasilievna,

865
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,680
I never like traveling by train.

866
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:09,360
There really are Reds at the stations.

867
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:12,189
It's like sailing through a minefield.

868
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:16,239
Like when you were off the coast of Pillau?

869
01:30:16,989 --> 01:30:19,079
Sergei Nikolaevich told me all about it.

870
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:29,039
I just wish we could meet
with Kappel now.

871
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:32,550
The Czechs have disarmed
our garrison in Irkutsk.

872
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:44,480
Kappel has 2,000 kilometers behind him.
In minus 40 weather. You know,

873
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:47,480
he is a man of light.

874
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:53,529
I will definitely introduce
you to him in Irkutsk.

875
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:58,319
I would be glad to meet him,
Alexander Vasilievich

876
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:14,590
Taiga, bank of the Kan.
375 km to Irkutsk

877
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:26,480
Your Excellency, we've veered
20 kilometers off course.

878
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,850
Cut across the river.
Time's up! Move on...

879
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,860
Don't spread out!
Pick up the pace.

880
01:31:36,689 --> 01:31:40,529
- Vladimir Oskarovich!
- Get back! It's an ice-hole here.

881
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:45,199
Help the commander, quick!

882
01:31:46,909 --> 01:31:48,869
Check the ice further up stream!

883
01:31:49,829 --> 01:31:50,960
Get back!

884
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:54,630
We have to cross it anyway.

885
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,010
Dry boots here!

886
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:03,850
- Hurry!
- Discharge, lieutenant..!

887
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,680
All we need now is for
you to get sick...

888
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,060
I'll go on foot to stay warm. Hurry.

889
01:32:10,899 --> 01:32:14,269
- What?
- Put your boots on. That's an order.

890
01:32:19,529 --> 01:32:20,779
Trans-Siberian railroad.
320 km to Irkutsk

891
01:32:20,989 --> 01:32:22,529
I've just received a message...

892
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,659
Our garrison in Irkutsk has fallen.

893
01:32:26,329 --> 01:32:29,710
Kappel is moving towards the city
and I have to meet him there.

894
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,920
- And you, Anna Vasilievna...
- I will be with you

895
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,670
wherever you are.

896
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,590
- And don't argue with me.
- My dear Anna,

897
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:42,890
what a dreadful story you
got mixed up in.

898
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,810
I have been here with you

899
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:56,570
and these were the best days
of my life. I have only one regret...

900
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:01,569
What is that?

901
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:06,079
We never had the chance to dance.

902
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:09,750
I promise you that
at the first ball...

903
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:13,710
we will dance till we drop.

904
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:25,090
May I come in?

905
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:28,510
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

906
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,640
The officers
have arrived as you ordered.

907
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:34,480
I haven't danced for so Iong.

908
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:46,119
I won't be Iong.

909
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:51,289
Zima station.
230 km to Irkutsk

910
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:23,689
Wait... where are you going? Wait!

911
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:29,619
Where are you going gentlemen?

912
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:35,409
What is wrong with you?
Are you scared?

913
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,170
Why are you abandoning him?

914
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,880
Don't you realize that
this is treason?

915
01:34:59,899 --> 01:35:02,899
The Admiral himseIf
dissolved the convoy.

916
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:23,130
If you want, I will stay.

917
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,670
No. I don't want you to.

918
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,470
So what are your orders?

919
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,350
Live, Misha, live -
always the best thing.

920
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:39,480
Now go. Go.

921
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,750
Find Sonya, Rostislav. Hug them.

922
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,880
Tell...

923
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,850
tell them something.

924
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,470
Farewell!

925
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:29,949
Irkutsk. General Janin's
control headquarters

926
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:38,500
It seems your situation could
not be worse, Mr. Janin.

927
01:36:40,369 --> 01:36:44,039
The railroaders are in revolt,
decided to rip up the tracks.

928
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:46,710
I barely managed to talk
them out of it.

929
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:52,510
The workers' committee decided
to blow up the Baikal tunnel.

930
01:36:56,970 --> 01:37:00,480
- Monsieur...
- Comrade.

931
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:05,479
Comrade...

932
01:37:07,529 --> 01:37:10,109
I am grateful to you
for your kindness.

933
01:37:10,189 --> 01:37:13,779
Where will you go, Mr. Janin
without a railroad?

934
01:37:14,659 --> 01:37:16,279
With your Czechs?

935
01:37:20,659 --> 01:37:22,159
I understand you.

936
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:24,880
What do you want?

937
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:30,300
We demand that Kolchak be
turned over to the Political Center.

938
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,810
But I am supposed to
be protecting him...

939
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:46,730
All right, since you are obliged,
then go ahead and protect him.

940
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:53,449
But what should I tell the workers

941
01:37:53,649 --> 01:37:55,449
who demand that
Kolchak be turned in?

942
01:37:57,369 --> 01:37:59,159
That could lead to Lynch law..

943
01:38:00,619 --> 01:38:03,829
Then I cannot guarantee
your personal safety.

944
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:37,199
Maybe we don't have to, doctor?

945
01:38:38,029 --> 01:38:41,489
There's no way around it...
Frostbite on your lower limbs.

946
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:43,909
Gangrene has set in -

947
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,039
there's no other choice, I'm afraid.

948
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,100
Go ahead, gentlemen...

949
01:39:17,609 --> 01:39:19,819
Your Excellency, leave us.

950
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,420
Lord,

951
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:38,180
help your son to endure
these dreadful sufferings.

952
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,430
Shut the door.

953
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:47,310
And may God be with you.

954
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:09,960
Irkutsk

955
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,350
Two of you come with me.
The rest of you wait.

956
01:40:35,649 --> 01:40:37,529
Here? May I come in.

957
01:40:46,409 --> 01:40:48,949
- Mr. Kolchak.
- What is it?

958
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:53,380
- Gather your belongings.
- Greetings.

959
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:59,760
We are turning you over
to the local authorities.

960
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:04,550
- Which authorities?
- The Irkutsk Political Center.

961
01:41:14,229 --> 01:41:15,559
I see...

962
01:41:28,739 --> 01:41:31,039
Mr. Kolchak, gather your belongings.

963
01:41:32,659 --> 01:41:34,289
Mrs. Timireva?

964
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,050
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

965
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:57,329
Mr. Admiral.

966
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:19,309
Mr. Admiral.

967
01:43:20,689 --> 01:43:23,729
- What?
- One minute, please.

968
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:36,409
I beg your pardon...
Do you have a weapon?

969
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:39,289
Yes.

970
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,380
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

971
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:57,100
What's going on?..
Get your hands off me.

972
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:00,650
- Mr. Pepelyaev, court decides.
- But Janin promised...

973
01:44:08,989 --> 01:44:12,159
Mr. Kolchak, one minute.
Wait here.

974
01:44:13,869 --> 01:44:16,500
- I demand...
- What is it?

975
01:44:16,699 --> 01:44:19,619
- Anna, why are you here?
- Arrest me!

976
01:44:19,829 --> 01:44:22,329
- Out of the way!
- Mrs. Timireva!

977
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:25,750
No order for your arrest.
On what grounds?

978
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:30,970
On the grounds that
I am the admiral's wife.

979
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,800
I implore you, don't do this!

980
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:41,440
Let me disobey you just this once,
Alexander Vasilievich.

981
01:44:48,859 --> 01:44:50,239
It's your right.

982
01:45:23,729 --> 01:45:25,559
Your Excellency...

983
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:29,989
Vladimir Oskarovich,
I insist again...

984
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:33,159
- ... that you...
- I repeat...

985
01:45:33,609 --> 01:45:35,119
...that I will not abandon the army.

986
01:45:37,489 --> 01:45:39,199
God is merciful.

987
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:03,020
Mr. Admiral, enter the cell.

988
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,150
Mr. Prime Minister, go ahead.

989
01:46:16,909 --> 01:46:18,829
- How is it there?
- Bad.

990
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,960
Voytsekhovsky...

991
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:33,670
Voytsekhovsky...

992
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:43,230
We'll take Irkutsk,

993
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,890
expel the Reds,

994
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:49,150
and free the Admiral.

995
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,690
Take charge of the command.

996
01:46:54,439 --> 01:46:56,239
And tell the troops...

997
01:46:56,449 --> 01:46:58,699
that I remained faithful to them...

998
01:47:01,659 --> 01:47:04,250
and proved this by dying
among them...

999
01:47:06,869 --> 01:47:09,710
- Do it... my friend...
- Yes, Sir!

1000
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:20,470
How could I get trapped...

1001
01:47:32,729 --> 01:47:36,029
Irkutsk ahead.

1002
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,119
Put on the pace.

1003
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:57,260
You heard, they're saying
Kappel is nearby.

1004
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:02,970
Look, Admiral.

1005
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,890
He has gone grey-haired...

1006
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:18,820
Stop, Iady. You're not to
be with him any longer.

1007
01:48:22,699 --> 01:48:27,199
Okay, but only for a minute.
Anna Vasilievna. Don't let me down.

1008
01:48:28,119 --> 01:48:29,960
Hello, Anna!

1009
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:34,090
Kappel's troops are just outside Irkutsk.
They'll set us free.

1010
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:38,920
My love, my darling,
we will get out of here.

1011
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:42,300
- They have issued an ultimatum.
- How do you know?

1012
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:45,180
I overheard from the next cell...

1013
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:50,640
- What are they demanding?
- That you be set free!

1014
01:48:55,899 --> 01:48:58,189
Now they will act quickly.

1015
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:01,199
No! No.

1016
01:49:01,659 --> 01:49:04,569
Kappel will make it.
Can't be any other way.

1017
01:49:08,619 --> 01:49:10,289
Anna Vasilievna!

1018
01:49:11,619 --> 01:49:15,250
- It's time.
- Go. Go.

1019
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:17,960
No I can't permit you,
I've allowed you...

1020
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:53,869
Irkutsk.

1021
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:14,849
To the arms!

1022
01:50:28,909 --> 01:50:30,539
Mr. Kolchak,

1023
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:42,460
on behalf of the Irkutsk
Revolutionary Committee,

1024
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:45,300
we have come to announce
a resolution about you...

1025
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:46,340
I understand.

1026
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:50,260
There is no
need for you to continue.

1027
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:59,150
Would you like to make
any requests or statements?

1028
01:51:01,569 --> 01:51:05,899
Let me say goodbye to my wife,
Anna Vasilievna Timireva.

1029
01:51:06,739 --> 01:51:08,029
This is not possibIe.

1030
01:51:08,909 --> 01:51:10,529
Anything else?

1031
01:51:49,529 --> 01:51:51,569
- Here?
- Yes, here.

1032
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:00,170
Would you like to be blindfolded?

1033
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,130
No.

1034
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:09,090
- And you?
- No, thank you, there is no need.

1035
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:27,190
Lord God, forgive me my sins, wilful
and unwilful, I appeal to your mercy.

1036
01:52:28,859 --> 01:52:30,819
Is there something you
would like to say?

1037
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:38,829
Please tell my wife in Paris

1038
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:43,960
that I bless my son.

1039
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:47,590
How many wives do you have?

1040
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,510
All right, I will relay the message.

1041
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:08,360
- Farewell, Admiral.
- Farewell.

1042
01:53:09,279 --> 01:53:10,949
Aim.

1043
01:53:15,409 --> 01:53:16,449
Fire!

1044
01:53:48,649 --> 01:53:51,739
Hey, you three. Put their
things on the cart.

1045
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:03,920
Three of you.
Drag out the next one...

1046
01:54:04,119 --> 01:54:06,960
What an odd hole in the ice?..

1047
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:11,010
It's baptism thing for
a church celebration.

1048
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:07,600
MOSFILM fiIm studio, 1964

1049
01:55:22,539 --> 01:55:25,369
Leave these ones,
and those we don't need...

1050
01:55:25,579 --> 01:55:29,250
I just checked the records.
It's her for sure.

1051
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:32,630
30 years in exiles! Wife
