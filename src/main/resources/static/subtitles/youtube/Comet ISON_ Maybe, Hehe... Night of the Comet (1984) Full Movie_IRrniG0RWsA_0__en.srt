anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a psychological standpoint</font>

370
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:47,318
the radio station represents a link to

371
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:50,200
normalcy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think they'll wandered</font>

373
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,269
I just like to say up front I'm opposed

374
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:57,578
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there's no reason for us to</font>

375
00:34:55,269 --> 00:35:00,909
bring those people or any other

376
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:02,798
survivors back here what about the

377
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:05,318
disintegration factor you just want to

378
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:07,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">let that happen and you don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

379
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:09,670
the condition is progressive I think

380
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,349
we've established that Audrey partial

381
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,210
protection seems to result in a slowing

382
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,338
of the overall effect a progression is

383
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,250
steady in any case drying up the body

384
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:20,230
fluids get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point on transition if</font>

385
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,599
you have some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mately what about</font>

386
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,880
the dust ultimately there is nothing

387
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,190
left but calcium dust right so there

388
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,338
isn't even enough hope to warrant

389
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,909
bringing anybody back here so what

390
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:39,358
you're saying is we shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even try</font>

391
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:44,190
you want to be caught a city after dark

you

484
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:18,690
we found survivors how long were the

485
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,429
blood test take not long I've talked

486
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:23,010
with some of the others and we decided

487
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:26,338
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it would be more beneficial to</font>

488
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:27,839
conduct the blood tests in the field so

489
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:37,139
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to go to LA with the rest of</font>

490
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:38,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">the group whatever the charity won't you</font>

491
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:41,788
don't seem to hold majority rule and

492
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:44,038
very high regard if something's wrong

493
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:46,528
it's wrong majority rule doesn't have

494
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,089
anything to do with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it goes</font>

495
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:50,849
straight to the core purpose of our

496
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">group which is to survive you'll grant</font>

497
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:57,920
me that the core purpose never included

498
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,920
bringing outsiders to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> facility</font>

499
00:50:55,610 --> 00:51:05,360

01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,219
would adolescence with nothing to do go

574
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:39,629

<font color="#E5E5E5">system and the system works why just a</font>

579
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:57,389
few days ago we were only stock boys now

<font color="#CCCCCC">believe let's play again it's called</font>

588
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:34,800
scary noises this is the closest

589
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,920
shopping arcade but the whole area<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

590
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:40,349
absolute monument to consumerism all we

591
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,250
can do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope check all the floors</font>

592
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:43,250
including the basement

593
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:56,689
isn't that a scary noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> went to hear it</font>

594
01:02:52,759 --> 01:03:05,659
again gosh the suspense is killing me

595
01:02:56,688 --> 01:03:08,199
let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it an e-ticket attraction let's</font>

596
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:08,199
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again</font>

597
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:18,219
now wait a minute I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

598
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:21,400
really a bullet in here no now see there

599
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:25,179
it's loaded I just needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a little</font>

600
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">more patient I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it girls I</font>

601
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:28,199
really do

602
01:03:34,829 --> 01:04:02,880
oh we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys really like</font>

01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the great minds of the world all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

605
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:12,659
great intellects who should survive

606
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:15,599
almost survive I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font>

607
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:18,619
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the blood test I can guess</font>

608
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,619
what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

609
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:24,699
you're right

610
01:04:22,869 --> 01:04:27,549
it would be senseless to take her back

611
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">look I'll stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and take care of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it then</font>

tests on him too of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course yeah it would</font>

614
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:40,079

by yourself I'll stay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>
