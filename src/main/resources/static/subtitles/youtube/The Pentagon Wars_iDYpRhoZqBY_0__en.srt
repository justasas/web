1
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,538
I think it might be useful to clarify
a few things right off the bat.

2
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,780
By simple definition,
we are in the business of winning wars.

3
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,777
What else do you need an army for?

4
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:54,335
Take the Cold War,
we won without firing a single shot.

5
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,168
Why? Number one,
we just flat out out-spent them.

6
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,769
The Russians couldn't shovel money
into the fire as fast as we could.

7
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:05,448
Number two, and this is where
my command comes in,

8
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,694
technology.

9
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,492
Nobody shapes nature the way we do.

10
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,332
We take atoms and molecules
and make them into everything

11
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,371
from combat boots to bombs.

12
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,808
Bombs the other side will never see

13
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,217
until they're ploughing down their
chimney like Santa Claus from hell!

14
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,454
General?

15
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,450
What?

16
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,413
This is not the first time
you've been here.

17
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,816
We've been down this road before,
that is correct.

18
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,374
Several times, in fact.

19
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,933
I haven't been keeping count.

20
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:47,734
Let me refresh your memory.
You have before you a document.

21
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,930
I do.

22
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,169
The sensor fused anti-tank missile.

23
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,692
I'll be the first to admit that this programme
had its share of difficulties.

24
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,290
We did experience a glitch or two
with the thing, that much is certain.

25
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,969
But even a heat-seeking missile
can miss a target.

26
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,854
General, I see here
that you taped electric hotplates

27
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,168
to the surface of the vehicle to help
your heat-seeking missile find its target

28
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,292
and that the temperature
of the vehicle was so high

29
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,456
that it could have fried an egg at 20 feet!

30
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,218
Commence fire!

31
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,771
There was a verifiable deviation
of the standard test data accumulation.

32
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,697
There were other deviations,
were there not?

33
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,730
What about the Paveway bomb?

34
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,811
I'm not going to tell you
the Paveway never missed.

35
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:06,617
It missed by a mean distance
of five miles and nearly 50% of the time.

36
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,696
You know...

37
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,336
in baseball, a guy who hits.400
is considered pretty damn great.

38
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,771
In baseball the losing team
isn't killed by their opponents.

39
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,220
Be that as it may,
the Paveway is one hell of a bomb.

40
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,057
Laser-guided, state-of-the-art.

41
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,888
And it proved what?
That we have an effective weapon

42
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,728
as long as the enemy allows us
to build a two-storey crane

43
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,770
directly above their tanks?

44
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,169
We have had some spectacular successes.

45
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,053
- Such as?
- That's classified information.

46
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,173
General...
Let's move on to the next item.

47
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,290
The Bradley fighting vehicle.

48
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,290
What would you say the batting average is
for the Bradley, General?

49
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,734
It takes people with sophisticated knowledge
and expertise

50
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,931
to conduct these tests
and to interpret the results.

51
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,971
If the US Army acted on the advice

52
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,931
of every Tom, Dick and Harry
who had an opinion,

53
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,973
we'd wind up with a bunch of B-52s
powered by outboard motors.

54
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,012
- I fail to see your point.
- My point is...

55
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,372
that a lot of things have to come together
to create a new weapon,

56
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,456
and it takes teamwork.

57
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,218
Good, old-fashioned teamwork.

58
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,211
Colonel James Burton -
was he part of your team, General?

59
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,250
More or less.

60
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,492
Post, sir?

61
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,733
Sergeant.

62
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,818
Can you tell me how to get to 4E-624?

63
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,330
Forward into the escalator,
your left, two flights up to four,

64
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,850
your left, E-ring, your right,
proceed past corridor nine, face left.

65
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,097
Thank you.

66
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,295
It's no secret that
Colonel Burton had a rocky tenure,

67
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,978
that we didn't see eye-to-eye.

68
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,409
But it didn't start out that way.

69
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,853
No, no, no, no, no!

70
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,855
I spoke to General Hall.

71
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,617
General Hall spoke to General Jones...

72
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,220
...General Jones spoke to Admiral Watts.

73
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,774
Well, then, write it down!

74
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,372
That takes care of Spina in Rhode Island,
and Mays from Nebraska. Any Democrats?

75
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,853
No, forget him.

76
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,136
Because he's a scum-sucking Judas
who'd sell his mother for a handful of votes.

77
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,535
How about the Senate?

78
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,492
That son of a bitch.
After we papered his state with contracts.

79
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,455
All right, let's make the fuselage in Michigan
and the landing gear in Mississippi.

80
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,971
By all means, let's keep Congressman Groves
and his bloodsucking buddies happy.

81
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,570
- Welcome, Colonel.
- Thank you, General.

82
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,409
- You and I ought to get to know one another.
- I welcome the opportunity, sir.

83
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,497
- Fact is, I'd like to help you.
- Thank you, sir.

84
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:53,897
Your new job, under certain circumstances,
can turn into a real shit-burnin' detail.

85
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,569
You're gonna need friends.
I'd like you to count me as one.

86
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,576
I appreciate that, sir.

87
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,258
Air Force Academy,

88
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:05,611
Strategic Air Command,
MBA from Auburn.

89
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,418
Your commanding officer,
General De Grasso and I, are old friends.

90
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,258
He says for you the sky is the limit.

91
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,015
But then you draw the short straw.

92
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,129
I was assigned, sir.

93
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,613
Hell, it's a bum deal, whoever made it.

94
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:27,653
Every other year, somebody decides
we're spending too much money.

95
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,535
A bunch of pencil-necks get together
and come up with a plan.

96
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,777
This year, it's the joint
live-fire test programme.

97
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,970
Staffed from all the services.

98
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,409
So now we got the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marines,

99
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,099
doing a circle-jerk over weapons testing,

100
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,972
and you get to hold the big dick.

101
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,091
I mean, who thinks up this nonsense?

102
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,250
Congress, sir?

103
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:59,815
And so it should, that's its job.
You'll never hear me criticise the Hill.

104
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,456
You'd think Congress has enough
of their own shit without wanting ours.

105
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,889
Well, I'm not anticipating any problems, sir.

106
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,578
Neither am I.

107
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,215
A man as clever as you
knows how to walk a minefield.

108
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,658
Howard Matheson.

109
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,658
Came here two rotations ago.
That marlin isn't all he caught.

110
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,171
I got him into SenCom and now
he's head of their missile testing.

111
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,417
- Blake Gelmore, you know Blake?
- No, sir.

112
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,453
Wasn't even a full-bird colonel
when he left for the private sector.

113
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,649
That was four years ago.

114
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,737
A few contracts later and look at him...

115
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,896
He could buy and sell both of us
a thousand times over.

116
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,931
- Lucky man.
- Smart man.

117
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,690
First-rate soldier, just like you. Knew
how to make the best of a difficult situation.

118
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,211
This new job of yours is tough.
It's going to require teamwork.

119
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,456
These are a couple of your projects
undergoing testing.

120
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,937
The UH-60 helicopter,
the AV-8B jump-jet

121
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,937
and the Bradley fighting vehicle.

122
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,539
All outstanding programmes,
all organised and ready to go.

123
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,571
I did a little homework for you.

124
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,530
I appreciate that, General.

125
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,290
You could return the favour by giving
the Bradley a little extra attention.

126
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,012
Attention?

127
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:17,415
We need it in the field.
The sooner the better.

128
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,451
Put it on top of all the things
in your inbox

129
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,572
so it'll get in your outbox
as soon as possible.

130
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,975
As a personal favour to me.

131
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,817
- Best of luck, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

132
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,819
- Colonel.
- Sir?

133
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,932
Next time you're told
to report to this office, be on time.

134
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,937
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,213
Sir.

136
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,889
Colonel James Burton,
I'm here to see the Bradley test.

137
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,215
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Thank you.

138
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,219
- There he is.
- That's the guy?

139
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,375
That's him, supposed to be real smart.

140
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,375
Squadron Officer School,

141
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,332
- Air Command and Staff College.
- First tour with the Pentagon?

142
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,975
He was at the Air Force lab
when Congress called.

143
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,294
He's a soldier, not just a manager.

144
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,298
- What do you mean?
- He's put in his fair share of flying time.

145
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,375
Looks like a fucking choirboy.

146
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,207
Maybe, but nothing goes into production
until he signs off.

147
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,048
Target is now in position...

148
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,413
Colonel Burton, JD Bach.
Welcome to the team. Ha-ha-ha!

149
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,655
- Colonel Bach.
- Good to see you.

150
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,649
This is Major Sayers, our chief tester.
Army Weapons Research Lab.

151
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,658
So how'd an Air Force guy end up
overseeing tests run by the Army?

152
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,419
- It could have been worse.
- How's that?

153
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,889
Congress could have appointed
someone from the Navy.

154
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,652
The range is now hot.
The range is now hot.

155
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,171
Commencing armour penetration tests
on the Bradley fighting vehicle.

156
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,654
Attention on the firing line.
Attention on the firing line.

157
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,497
Are you ready on the right?

158
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:27,856
Ready on the left?

159
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,494
Firing line is ready.

160
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,053
Firing detail, commence firing.

161
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,455
Cease fire. Cease fire.

162
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,174
- Ha-ha! Damn impressive armour.
- Congratulations.

163
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,691
All right, drinks are on me, gentlemen.
Joining us, Colonel Burton?

164
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,493
Congratulations, thanks for your help.

165
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:58,576
We couldn't have done it without you. Thanks.

166
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,568
- Say, Colonel, are you gonna join us?
- Well...

167
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,610
Shouldn't we take a closer look?

168
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,093
No, actually, safety precautions.

169
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,335
See, the fire team goes out first,

170
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,850
no one else is allowed near the vehicle
for another hour.

171
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:17,096
- Why is that?
- Any test involving a live round,

172
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,336
there's a freak chance
that something might blow.

173
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,850
We don't wanna lose you
first day on the job, Colonel.

174
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,255
- How about that drink?
- Sounds good, Major.

175
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,650
There'll be a phone call for you in your office
at 1100 hours. It's important you be there.

176
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,454
- Good morning.
- Welcome, sir.

177
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,458
- Welcome, sir.
- Morning.

178
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,572
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, sir.

179
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,453
- I unpacked a few of your things.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

180
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,410
- Family, sir?
- What's that?

181
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,338
- Family.
- Oh, that's my uncle.

182
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,179
- He was a flier in World War II.
- Hm.

183
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,617
Huh!

184
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,813
- What's that?
- The plane I learned to fly in, a T-28.

185
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,772
I used to take her up, slide the canopy back,

186
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,489
and fly for hours.

187
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,530
Just me and the sky.

188
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,176
Personally, I like the sky where it is -
with me on the ground looking up at it.

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,933
So, where you from, sir?

190
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,652
Just outside of Chicago.

191
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,817
Hm. And where would that be?

192
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,928
Normal.

193
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,177
Normal, Illinois, is that on the map?

194
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,295
Yes, Sergeant, it is.

195
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,053
Is it normal in Normal?

196
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,570
I think the word is uneventful.

197
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,734
You getting paid by the hour, Colonel?

198
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,055
No, I got an appointment.

199
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,579
I'II, um... take this, Sergeant, thank you.

200
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,778
Fine.

201
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,338
Mm-hm.

202
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,691
Colonel Burton.

203
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,573
Hello?

204
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,088
The test on the Bradley,
I hear you wanted a closer look.

205
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,936
How did you hear that?

206
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,814
When it comes to the Bradley,
follow your instincts, Colonel.

207
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,976
- Who is this?
- I can't tell you that right now.

208
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:19,252
Well, whoever you are, I don't take
unsolicited advice from people I don't know.

209
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,416
Just make sure you read
the fine print, Colonel.

210
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,336
Sir, Colonel Burton. Sir.

211
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,173
You're up early, sir.

212
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,055
I'm on my way to the office, Sergeant.
Thought I'd check out the Bradley.

213
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:44,092
Sir, isn't your office 40 miles that way, sir?

214
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,010
Yes, Sergeant, yes, it is.

215
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,730
Has anything been altered
on this vehicle since the test?

216
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,178
No, sir.

217
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,608
Are you looking for something, sir?

218
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,858
Just reading the fine print, Sergeant.
Just reading the fine print.

219
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,011
Stinger missiles, 50 cal tracers.

220
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,255
7.62 tracers.

221
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,415
25mm rounds.

222
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,769
- What's this?
- That was used on the Bradley, sir.

223
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,092
This writing, it's Romanian, isn't it?

224
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,291
Yes, sir, it is.

225
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,536
Sir, Colonel Bach and Major Sayers
won't be here until noon.

226
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,218
That's when our first test is scheduled, sir.

227
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:20,617
This isn't exactly an all-out test, Sergeant.
More like a little pop quiz.

228
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,051
I'm not sure regulations allow us to borrow
the door from the ammunition shed

229
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,454
for a pop quiz, sir.

230
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,732
Sir, regulations state that the ammunition shed
should never be left open, sir.

231
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,576
Duly noted, Sergeant.

232
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,134
Regulations also apply
to removing the door, Colonel.

233
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,772
Also duly noted.

234
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,817
Fire when ready.

235
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,615
Backblast area clear! On the way, sir.

236
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,808
Fire.

237
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,808
Come on straight... Hold!

238
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,298
You wrecked a door?

239
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:08,375
Colonel, the ammunition
used on the test on the Bradley

240
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,615
is the same as we used on this door.

241
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,288
Romanian - the most ineffective
ammunition in the world.

242
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,536
- No wonder the Bradley passed.
- This is serious.

243
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:19,968
- It is!
- Yes, you destroyed a door.

244
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,329
It was tested on
an armoured personnel carrier,

245
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,940
a vehicle to carry soldiers into combat.

246
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,370
This door is property of
the United States government.

247
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,980
The shell barely penetrated the door.

248
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:35,296
OK, but it's all bent.
How are you gonna put it back?

249
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,569
I'm not really worried about that!

250
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,976
- This door protects our ammunition.
- The ammunition doesn't work!

251
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,932
But we need the ammunition for our tests.

252
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,211
Look - I'll buy the Army
a new goddamn door.

253
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,219
You can't afford a door like that.
Did you see what it stood up to?

254
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,536
Exactly! Some spitball from Romania!

255
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:01,130
It was my understanding that only Soviet arms
would be used in these tests.

256
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,459
Well, yes, and Romania
is one of the Soviet blocs...

257
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,451
- Isn't it?
- Colonel Burton,

258
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,298
we've been testing
the Bradley for some time.

259
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,251
You may not be aware
of some steps we've taken.

260
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,770
The Romanian rocket is only 73mm.
That's less than the 85mm Russian.

261
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,336
A smaller diameter means
a smaller explosion and less shrapnel.

262
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,658
We're conducting tests
using ammunition of varying diameters

263
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,659
to determine the exact threshold
of the Bradley's tolerance.

264
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,568
So far it's held up against everything
we've thrown at it, sir - Soviet, Romanian.

265
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:40,450
Latvian, Lithuanian...

266
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,855
Like a rock.

267
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,499
My apologies.

268
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,815
You're new to the project.

269
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:51,850
There's a lot to catch up on.

270
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,099
You're right. So if you'll get me
the test reports, I can catch right up.

271
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,734
- How's that, Colonel?
- Send me the data,

272
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:02,339
I'll do my homework,
and we can push through.

273
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,133
We've got five years of test reports, sir.

274
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,899
- We have a schedule.
- Let's keep to it,

275
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,615
get the Bradley into production, ASAP,
what do you say?

276
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,610
Thank you, gentlemen.

277
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:25,095
This could blow the whole deal.

278
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,371
You've got to stop this
like you did with the last guy.

279
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,048
- Don't worry about it.
- Sir, he wants to see the reports.

280
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:35,535
- Just give him the reports.
- Are you out of your mind?

281
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,413
Now listen to me. Listen very carefully.

282
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,016
Give him everything he wants.

283
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,210
Every single piece of paper.

284
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,978
Everything.

285
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,978
- Sergeant?
- Here, sir.

286
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,172
What the heck is all this?

287
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,451
Everything you ever wanted to know about
the Bradley and weren't afraid to ask.

288
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,059
Every memo on every last nut and bolt.

289
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,369
I wonder which national forest
died for this project.

290
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,413
- You read any of this stuff?
- I hoped you'd have the Cliff Notes.

291
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,896
- I hardly know where to start.
- Maybe that's the whole idea.

292
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,451
I don't get it.
What?

293
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,375
- That.
- It's the Bradley.

294
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,459
Well, if that's the Bradley, then what's this?

295
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:44,173
- What's the date?
- 1968.

296
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,699
The question is, how did they get to that...

297
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,570
from this?

298
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:02,048
Gentlemen, our mission
was to design and implement

299
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,377
an infantry transport vehicle
that would be a worthy replacement

300
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,253
for the M-113 armoured personnel carrier.

301
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,133
We have met that objective and then some.

302
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,774
The Bradley armoured personnel carrier

303
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:19,937
will bring troops to a combat zone
swiftly, efficiently, and safely.

304
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,211
It will hold 11 men plus a driver,

305
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,648
and features a 20mm cannon,

306
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,328
which will provide
ample firepower and flexibility.

307
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,456
Lightly armoured, speedy
and solidly engineered,

308
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,936
our troops will arrive at the battlefield
in the finest American technology.

309
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,256
And at a million and a half per,
a real bargain.

310
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,857
Nice work, Colonel!

311
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,298
Outstanding!

312
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:47,170
Damn impressive!

313
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:54,055
So it was a big taxicab - drive guys
to the battlefield and go back home.

314
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,090
Mm-hm.

315
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:02,173
But how did it
end up with a turret on top?

316
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,019
Hm. Hm-hm-hm.

317
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,368
- This is all well and good...
- Something wrong, General?

318
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,618
There won't be anything left in the budget
for my scout.

319
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,058
I doubt it, Bob.

320
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,978
You don't need scouts -
you have radar, air-recon, satellites.

321
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,730
You always need a scout -
why couldn't this thing serve as a scout?

322
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,930
But it's a troop carrier, General.

323
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,368
This is a speedy vehicle. Why can't it be both?

324
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,375
For one thing, it's too big.

325
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,491
And you can't really see out much from inside.

326
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,088
- Sounds like a design flaw to me.
- Design flaw? No...

327
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,179
We'll just stick a turret on top
with lots of opticals.

328
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,018
But then, sir, it'll be even bigger.

329
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:50,096
What's your problem, Smith?
Not elegant enough for you?

330
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,014
The thing is, it's hard to do a "sneak
and peek" when you're over ten feet tall.

331
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,051
- He's got a point, Bob.
- We need a scout.

332
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:03,693
This is fast enough and it's funded.

333
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,892
- Actually, we're a hair over budget.
- Turn the Bradley into a scout

334
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,297
and we're gonna be selling them off
to some el presidente in no time!

335
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:16,218
Anything for surveillance
ends up south of the border.

336
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:19,569
That anti-aircraft gun,
who backed you up on that?

337
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,612
- You did, Bob.
- Who testified to Appropriations?

338
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,335
- You did, Bob.
- I'm talking to Appropriations next week.

339
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,213
Do I sell you on my scout or do I not?

340
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:32,454
You did, Bob.

341
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,888
How about portholes along the side?

342
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,899
So the fellas can stick out their guns
and shoot people!

343
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,249
Good. And you know what, Colonel?

344
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,577
We already have the turret.
We oughta get the biggest bang we can.

345
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:47,337
I'm sorry - bang, sir?

346
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,417
You can't hurt anybody
with that pansy-ass gun!

347
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,054
Add on some firepower!

348
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,608
- Where do I fit the extra ammo?
- I don't know. Shift things around.

349
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,653
4400 rounds of machine gun ammo,
and you wanna add 25mm shells?

350
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,978
- The General wants his ammo.
- He can't have it unless he carries it.

351
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,010
- Can you squeeze it in?
- No.

352
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,175
Just squeeze it in!

353
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,893
We're not trying on Levi's here, Colonel.

354
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,692
Are you telling me that in a vehicle this size,

355
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,538
you can't fit a few rounds of ammunition?

356
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:24,298
Not in its current configuration, no, sir.

357
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:28,935
So, the configuration is wrong.
There must be something you can dump.

358
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,256
- Dump, sir?
- Something you don't need.

359
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:34,859
General, the interior is very spare.

360
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,778
Besides the ammunition and the men...

361
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:41,698
Leave one of the fellas behind.
Put the ammo where the men go.

362
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,376
Sir...

363
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,490
it is a troop carrier.

364
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,213
So, make a couple of extra trips,
what's the difference?

365
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,736
They want a transport
that doesn't carry men,

366
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:04,771
and a scout that's got a cannon
as big as a tank's.

367
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:07,333
- And portholes.
- Great, portholes!

368
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,850
To shoot at whatever
they can't hit with their cannon.

369
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,413
You don't have to buy it, just draw it.

370
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:34,934
- That's one hell of a cannon.
- That's the problem.

371
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,378
Why?

372
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,971
You go out on a battlefield
with this pecker sticking out of your turret,

373
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,410
and the enemy is gonna
unload on you with all they got.

374
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,213
But it's a troop carrier, not a tank.

375
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,171
You want me to put a sign on it -

376
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,610
"I am a troop carrier, not a tank,
please don't shoot"?

377
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,414
This was going to be so beautiful.

378
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,128
- Good work, Smith.
- Looks perfect.

379
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,216
- Thank you, sir.
- The thing is...

380
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:11,658
Yes, General?

381
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,296
Looks a little like a tank with that cannon.
Probably gonna draw more fire.

382
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,137
Actually, sir, that has come to our attention.

383
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,855
We know it's not a tank,
but will the other side?

384
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,778
I guess we could always thicken the armour.

385
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:31,567
Colonel Smith, could you explain
why you put those portholes there?

386
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:36,977
Yes, sir, as per your request,
so the men can shoot out at the enemy.

387
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,048
- You're joking, aren't you?
- Portholes? Are we in the navy?

388
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,533
Say... you think you could
make this thing amphibious?

389
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,695
Get the troops across a river?

390
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,138
No.

391
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,135
No, sir. No.

392
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,091
No, no, no, no, no.

393
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,132
Amphibious?
The Bradley's supposed to swim?

394
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,050
In theory, at least.

395
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,569
Amphibious troop carrier slash scout...

396
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,018
Slash tank.

397
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:10,778
A couple more months,
I bet this thing can fly.

398
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:13,095
What's this in the margin?

399
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,131
"Please help me,

400
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,614
"I am losing my mind,

401
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,535
"RLS."

402
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,056
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laurel Smith,
head of oversight and development.

403
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,615
Aluminium.

404
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,379
- This thing's got an aluminium skin.
- Huh?

405
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:43,611
Anything fired at it will go through it
like a hot knife through butter.

406
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,618
We're using steel rather than aluminium.

407
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,096
Of course, steel is
much heavier than aluminium,

408
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,335
so it won't go as fast.

409
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,451
We can't lose speed -
it won't work as a scout.

410
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,775
It won't keep pace with tanks, either.

411
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:01,255
Armour's a reactive measure.
Let's think proactive.

412
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:03,608
Equip it with anti-tank missiles,

413
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,288
then it can blast those enemy tanks
before they fire.

414
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:09,330
What do you think, Colonel?

415
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,698
Fine.

416
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,774
- Anti-tank missiles?
- I don't know.

417
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,778
The men will have to wear
the missiles as hats!

418
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:22,175
I don't know, Jones.
That's why you get paid big bucks.

419
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,294
- Colonel, we're not talking about...
- A pair of Levi's. I know!

420
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,694
God damn it!

421
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,335
We are talking about 11 years
with nothing to show for it!

422
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,850
Except an ulcer the size
of the district of Columbia

423
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,936
and a career on permanent hold!

424
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,333
You see this?

425
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,771
I've been... I've been a bird colonel so long,
I swear I'm growing feathers!

426
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:51,971
If you have to design hats to haul
those goddamn missiles, then just do it.

427
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,131
Excuse me, sir...

428
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:26,375
Uh... ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention, please.

429
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,296
If you'd all just take your seats.

430
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,217
Thank you.

431
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,336
We are pleased to present a scale model

432
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:43,930
of the new Bradley fighting vehicle.

433
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,815
Featuring scout, troop transport,
and anti-tank capabilities,

434
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,375
it carries six men.

435
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,615
How many was it supposed to carry?

436
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,969
- 11.
- The Bradley is outfitted

437
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,455
with sophisticated surveillance equipment.

438
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,496
It is also equipped with a rapid-fire cannon,
and an anti-tank rocket launcher.

439
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,690
Which means it's loaded with...

440
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,176
1500 shells and ten TOW anti-tank missiles.

441
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,418
So in summation, gentlemen,
what you have before you is...

442
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,134
A troop transport that can't carry troops,

443
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,173
a reconnaissance vehicle that's
too conspicuous to do reconnaissance...

444
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,212
And a quasi-tank that has
less armour than a snow-blower

445
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:04,251
but has enough ammo to take out half of DC.

446
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:08,612
- Fantastic.
- Congratulations, General Smith.

447
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,695
- General?
- Helluva job.

448
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,650
General?

449
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,530
Let's build it.

450
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,211
They're building it?

451
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,932
This is what we're building?

452
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,138
Please be seated.

453
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,251
This will be brief,
I'm needed at the Oval Office.

454
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,372
I want to show you
this morning's New York Times.

455
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,014
If you'd be so kind to turn
to the editorial page.

456
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:52,132
It essentially says that every weapon
we produce is overpriced junk.

457
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,694
Now, that's not news.
Critics have said it for years.

458
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,809
What was news to me

459
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,172
touched on our supposedly spectacular
"Sergeant York" anti-aircraft gun.

460
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:07,168
It says there when the Sergeant York
proved incapable of hitting airplanes,

461
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:10,370
we test-fired it at hovering helicopters.

462
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,139
When it failed to hit hovering helicopters,

463
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:16,376
we fired at stationary targets
and it missed those.

464
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,570
Now is this possible, General Keane?

465
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:23,498
There was a problem with the proximity fusing.

466
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,295
According to this, one missile locked
on to a ventilation fan in the latrine!

467
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,175
And destroyed the latrine.
Were we test-firing at latrines that day?

468
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:38,009
My first sergeant was in that latrine
and he's around to swear otherwise.

469
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,177
Why am I learning about this
in the newspaper?

470
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:45,098
It makes me look foolish,
and I am not a foolish man.

471
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:49,212
General Cushing, any problems
with the Maverick missile tests?

472
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,659
No, sir.

473
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:53,134
Admiral Morehouse, any problems?

474
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:56,251
- None whatsoever, sir.
- General Partridge...

475
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,336
- Sir!
- Problems with the Bradley?

476
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,735
No, sir, absolutely not.

477
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,771
Production is imminent.

478
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,578
Mr Secretary, I believe
the press is on a wild-goose chase,

479
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,498
looking for problems where none exist.

480
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:15,614
Let's hope you're right, General.
Because we do have problems.

481
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:19,732
Terrorists in Lebanon,
and Colonel Qadhafi in Libya,

482
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,169
and Sandinistas in Nicaragua,

483
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,529
and let's not forget our ongoing problems
with the Soviet Union.

484
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:32,217
Frankly, I don't appreciate calls
from reporters and congressmen

485
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,538
asking me why nothing
we are working on works,

486
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:41,492
and I can't answer them because
the men developing these systems

487
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,735
tell me everything is just peachy!

488
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,696
So, if you don't have problems, good.

489
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,775
If you do, get rid of them.

490
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,371
I want these weapons built.
If not by you, I'll find men who can.

491
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:18,652
You wanted to see me, sir?

492
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:20,212
Yes, I do.

493
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,251
Close the damn door, come on.

494
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,533
About these tests you've been
thinking about conducting on the Bradley.

495
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,570
I understand your concern,

496
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,817
but if you were an armoured warfare expert
instead of a flier,

497
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,296
you'd understand
the Bradley is a good vehicle.

498
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,333
4,000 Americans will be employed building it,
the Army wants it.

499
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,497
- Read the files...
- I've read the files, sir.

500
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:48,413
200 pages on the rear door,

501
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,773
250 pages on the paint job,
computer simulations of combat -

502
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,177
not a single test that indicates what
might happen if the Bradley takes a hit.

503
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,409
Which is why I've ordered
a full-up live fire test.

504
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:08,727
I want to equip a Bradley with
all the ammunition it would take into battle,

505
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,137
fill all the fuel tanks, and hit it
with a Soviet anti-tank weapon,

506
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:16,251
- to see how it'll hold up.
- Cancel it.

507
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,289
Sir?

508
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,615
I think we're having
a communication meltdown.

509
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:25,210
Whatever problems there are, we'll fix them -
in the field, after they're deployed.

510
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,491
- General...
- That's the way we're gonna do this.

511
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,416
Nobody takes your job
more seriously than I do,

512
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,769
but I also have a job -
to deploy that Bradley.

513
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,495
I want that rocket launcher
pointed at the Soviets.

514
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:44,737
Here.

515
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,452
Jesus.

516
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,217
Dismissed.

517
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,097
- Afternoon. Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

518
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:58,054
- Fanning!
- Yes, sir?

519
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,132
- What happened to you?
- Don't ask. What's this?

520
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,216
It was on your desk
when I got back from lunch.

521
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:21,298
Some ammunition for your Bradley battle.

522
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:28,978
Hm!

523
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,851
It's a British Army test report.

524
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,575
Top secret too.

525
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,610
Until it landed here.

526
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,137
General Smith, Jim Burton.

527
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,608
How did you find me?

528
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,096
You have very distinctive handwriting.

529
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,291
I've been reading memos on the Bradley
going back to 1968,

530
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,497
with your handwritten notes in the margin,
or... initialled by you.

531
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,335
- This handwriting?
- We should not be seen talking.

532
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:40,094
Look, you contacted me, General.

533
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:44,212
No. You received an anonymous leak
about which I know nothing.

534
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,175
The British found out that aluminium
gives off a toxic gas when hit by a shell.

535
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:52,689
Bad news for men
in aluminium armoured vehicles.

536
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:56,652
Couldn't we... couldn't we sit down
somewhere and actually talk?

537
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,496
If the Pentagon had their choice
of busting us or nailing a Soviet spy,

538
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,894
they would choose us in a heartbeat.

539
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,171
Who exactly is "us", General?

540
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:19,259
Some people who work in the Pentagon
are fed up watching billions of dollars

541
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,691
thrown away on defective weapons
upon which our troops stake their lives.

542
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,892
People like you, Colonel.
We are the enemy.

543
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,898
- To whom?
- To majors who want to be colonels,

544
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,979
colonels who want to be generals,
you bet we are the enemy.

545
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:37,250
To move up, you have to get things done.

546
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,097
You don't want to be the one
who drops the ball,

547
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:43,290
cos if you drop the ball,
no promotion, no star,

548
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,650
no cushy job with a contractor
when you retire.

549
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:52,172
Which is why, Colonel, everyone
attached to the Bradley will stop your tests.

550
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,613
General, I appreciate your interests
if not your methods.

551
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:04,368
Whatever disagreements
I may be having over the Bradley

552
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,253
will be resolved above board.

553
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,899
Now, if you have something to say,

554
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,615
I'm sure the Washington Post
would love to talk to you.

555
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,211
Me? The press? Are you crazy?
The Army is my life.

556
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:24,538
Like you, I work inside the system, and
you don't have a prayer of running your tests,

557
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:27,413
not unless you're willing
to sacrifice your career.

558
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,612
And if you think you're safe because
Congress gave you your job, think again.

559
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,855
Good day, Colonel. And good luck.

560
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,010
So why did you send me that report?

561
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,058
Sir.

562
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,847
- Nice to see you, General.
- Good to see you.

563
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:01,375
- Evening, sir.
- Evening, sir.

564
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,979
So she whispered to me, "Why do you think
the General always stands at attention?"

565
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,739
- Sir, Major Sayers is in the library.
- Tell Major Sayers I'm busy.

566
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,136
He said the little prick
ordered tests on the Bradley.

567
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,251
What? I'll have his ass in a sling so fast.

568
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,736
Whose ass, sir? Major Sayers
or the little prick?

569
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,931
General, he knows about
the study the Brits did.

570
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,050
- What study?
- On aluminium.

571
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:35,329
Aluminium's used on the Bradley, sir.

572
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,416
When hit by a shell, it burns
and gives off a toxic gas.

573
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,608
God damn it.

574
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,891
We fought a revolution
so we could ignore the fucking British!

575
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,737
So why mess things up now?

576
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,340
- I thought you talked to him.
- I did.

577
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,177
- The man must be a fool.
- Can't you stop him, sir?

578
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:53,608
No, I'm not his commanding officer.

579
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:58,528
Some draft-dodging junior congressman
wanted more objectivity in the testing process.

580
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,570
Goddamn checks and balances.

581
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:04,248
General, with all due respect,
this isn't just a check, sir,

582
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,370
it's a full fucking body block!

583
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,335
If we don't get the Bradley out there now,
it'll be stuck in development forever.

584
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,729
Start production now.

585
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,375
Throw Burton a bone or two.
Let him run a couple of tests.

586
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,856
Yes, sir. General, actually,
he'd like to blow it up.

587
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,255
I don't give a fuck what Burton wants.

588
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,498
Let him do some piddly-shit stuff,
see if he can parallel park the fucker!

589
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,530
Just get it into production.

590
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,857
Am I to understand
that you were not in favour

591
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,334
of the tests Colonel Burton proposed?

592
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,177
Absolutely not.

593
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,492
Absolutely not, yes,
or absolutely not, no?

594
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,655
Absolutely not absolutely.

595
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,736
Are you questioning
his motives or his methods?

596
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,489
I have no reason to question
Colonel Burton's motives.

597
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,769
I can only speak to his methods.

598
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,894
Which, by anyone's definition
were somewhat peculiar.

599
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,894
There were other ways to find out

600
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,172
if clothing would catch fire
inside the Bradley when it took a hit.

601
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:26,655
Let's take the... the mannequin thing.

602
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,930
- Colonel.
- Yes?

603
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:54,688
- Phone call, sir. They said it's important.
- Very good.

604
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:56,809
- Dalton.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,250
- I'll meet you back at the firing area.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,579
- Strip the dummies.
- Sir?

607
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,812
Strip the dummies, Sergeant, now.

608
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,454
Thank you. Let's go.

609
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,297
Fire when ready.

610
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,615
Backblast area clear!

611
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,219
- Out of the way, sir.
- Fire.

612
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:42,608
Hold it there. Let me see those.

613
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:46,971
Uh-huh. That looks good,
uniforms look good. Great, there you go.

614
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,612
Wait a minute, what's that?

615
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:53,775
That's part of our test, Colonel.

616
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,172
Wait a minute.

617
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:04,695
No one in my command
gave the order to strip the dummies

618
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,811
and put their clothes
inside a fireproof container

619
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,296
inside the vehicle while
Colonel Burton wasn't around.

620
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,854
You're a pair of clowns!

621
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,329
The insults that were traded that day

622
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,291
had no business
showing up in the test reports.

623
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,218
They were deleted from the final report.

624
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,971
All except Colonel Bach's unfortunate
reference to Colonel Burton's mother.

625
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,615
Temperatures were running high.

626
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:35,378
Apparently inside the Bradley as well.

627
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,369
There's a degree of uncertainty
involved in every test.

628
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,168
That's the point of doing tests -
to find out what happens.

629
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,615
If we knew what the results would be,
we wouldn't need to do the test.

630
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:57,255
And just because the tests
didn't always come out

631
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,655
the way Colonel Burton expected...

632
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,375
is no reason to assume that
anything devious was going on.

633
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,209
I ask you, General,
filling the fuel tanks with water

634
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,491
for a test designed
to check the combustibility

635
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:17,168
of those tanks - that wasn't devious?

636
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:21,177
If the tanks had been filled with fuel

637
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:24,928
there's a good chance
the vehicle would have exploded.

638
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,210
Isn't that the point?

639
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:34,692
If the vehicle had exploded,
we couldn't run additional tests.

640
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,210
I can't order up an unlimited number
of Bradleys just to blow them up!

641
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,853
Unless you're telling me
to spend more money.

642
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,019
General, I believe that efforts
were made to make the Bradley amphibious?

643
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:53,056
Yes, although how that's relevant
I fail to comprehend.

644
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,297
How many Bradleys
were lost during that experiment?

645
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,739
Lost?

646
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,693
The report says
four of the Bradleys sank during testing.

647
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,730
That is a matter of opinion.

648
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,056
It's not opinion, General.

649
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:10,090
Four of them sank.

650
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,693
Technically, yes.

651
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:19,333
General,
can we get back to the fuel tanks?

652
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,137
Come on. Good.

653
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,773
Sergeant, have the tanks
always been filled with water?

654
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:30,931
No, sir.

655
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,699
Only when the vehicle is being tested, sir.

656
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,730
What else don't I know?

657
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,414
Sergeant, I'm asking you a question.

658
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,974
What else don't I know about these tests?

659
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:50,017
The ammunition stored in the Bradley, sir.

660
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,852
What about it?

661
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,938
Sand.

662
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,936
That's affirmative, sir.

663
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,851
Tell me...

664
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,572
did the term "court-martial"

665
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,610
ever enter anyone's mind here?

666
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,650
- No, sir.
- Really?

667
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,815
That's truly amazing, Sergeant.

668
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,899
Here we are watching
water drip out of the gas tanks

669
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,818
and sand spill out of the ammunition

670
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,899
after a test that was done to figure out
whether or not the damn thing is safe!

671
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,809
And no one here even thinks
of the term "court-martial"?

672
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:44,335
Now why, if you don't mind my asking, is that?

673
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,012
We were under orders, sir.

674
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,369
Is acting on those orders
conscionable, Sergeant?

675
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,730
It doesn't matter what I think or do, sir,

676
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,248
because you desk warriors from Washington

677
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,450
will find a million different ways

678
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,492
to make the tests turn out
whatever way you want, sir.

679
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:06,215
I'm not here to manipulate test results.

680
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,773
- I'm here to learn the truth.
- You want the truth, sir?

681
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,335
We get a new white knight
every other year, sir.

682
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,416
Some guy just like you,
and you all start off the same.

683
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,614
Big speeches that turn to shit after six months
when your next promotion comes due.

684
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:24,889
And then it's business as usual.

685
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,728
Where did you pick up
this lousy attitude, Sergeant?

686
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,736
Right here, sir,

687
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,291
watching guys like you.

688
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,936
Well, I'm sorry.

689
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:43,250
I'm really sorry to hear that.

690
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:49,456
Cos unlike you, I take my job seriously.

691
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,338
Really?

692
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:01,176
Well, maybe... maybe
you can explain to me, Colonel,

693
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:06,692
why the Bradley has been ordered into
production before you have done your job.

694
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:27,009
What is this?
100 Bradleys have been ordered?

695
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,690
I'm not gonna have it on my record
that the Bradley fell behind schedule

696
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:33,695
because of some goddamn tests.

697
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:36,378
Those goddamn tests could save lives.

698
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,856
The Bradley will save lives, Colonel,
by bringing men to the front line.

699
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,255
Do you know what would happen to those men

700
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,097
if the Bradley is hit and the aluminium burns?

701
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,737
I know all about the British study, Colonel.
And it is bullshit.

702
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,374
That thing could be a deathtrap.

703
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,570
- Says who?
- Says me.

704
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:59,373
Have you put people in there during the test?

705
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,969
- No, of...
- So you don't actually know anything.

706
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:06,695
And until you do,
all you're doing is wasting our time.

707
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:15,337
Are you suggesting Colonel Burton
had no reason to be concerned?

708
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,419
I am suggesting
that Colonel Burton and his tests

709
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:23,418
did not reveal anything
we didn't already know.

710
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,213
Except his own penchant for theatrics.

711
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,013
- Theatrics, General?
- Yes, theatrics.

712
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:31,175
Cheap theatrics at that.

713
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:33,687
Now the little prick has issued a memo

714
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:38,290
that stipulates that for the tests
he'd like to use sheep.

715
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,650
Jesus, we already started work
on the chassis assembly.

716
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:43,849
- Don't worry.
- If the sheep die

717
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,778
- we're gonna have to stop production.
- There are ways around it.

718
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,731
- Absolutely.
- Like what?

719
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,374
We could sic the animal rights people on him.

720
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,537
It is cruel and unusual treatment of sheep.

721
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,695
Rack of lamb.

722
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,097
Yeah, that would be me.

723
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,336
- Yes.
- Major Sayers just called, sir.

724
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,896
- When do they plan to run the tests?
- As soon as we send over the sheep.

725
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,329
"We"? I thought they were
in charge of the sheep.

726
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,847
They say it's being handled at our end.

727
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,374
The Surgeon General's office.

728
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:25,929
What does the Surgeon General
have to do with sheep?

729
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,650
- Excuse me.
- Colonel Burton.

730
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:35,931
- We were told you might show up.
- Who told you that?

731
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,610
Colonel Bach, he established this office
last week with the Surgeon General.

732
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:44,652
- You're trying to kill the Bradley.
- Who told you that?

733
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,128
I'm sorry, sir, all information
in this office is classified.

734
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:54,333
So, what is
"ruminant procurement" anyway?

735
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:57,852
That's what this office has been created to do.

736
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,528
- But what is it?
- Analysis and policy determination

737
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:05,458
for tendered research data
on the optimal test ruminant.

738
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,297
Such ruminants are to be...

739
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,016
You're talking about sheep.
You're in charge of buying sheep, correct?

740
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,967
We can't just go out and buy sheep, sir.

741
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:17,612
Why not?

742
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:20,538
We're doing a vaporifics test on sheep.

743
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:26,496
Vaporifics is all about what happens
when a warhead penetrates armour.

744
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:29,576
Lieutenant, I know what a vaporifics test is.

745
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,530
I'm the one who called for it.

746
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:36,050
Well, then you know we have to have
sheep specs before we can proceed.

747
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,853
Sheep specs, what is sheep specs?

748
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,572
Specifications!

749
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:45,250
Shorn or unshorn, rams, ewes or lambs?

750
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,978
Merinos or short hair?
Shorn merino ewes or unshorn merino lambs?

751
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:54,092
Bighorns or domestic?
Domestic shorn lambs or bighorn unshorn?

752
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:57,529
Just, how long will it take you
to get your sheep specs?

753
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:00,616
Not long at all, six, eight months, tops.

754
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:06,018
But then we'll require another eight months
to evaluate the data.

755
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:10,132
After which we can move
into prototype ruminant evaluation...

756
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,135
- How much?
- Well...

757
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,775
All right, bring it back.

758
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,971
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

759
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,575
A little more. A little more.

760
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,098
Whoa!

761
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:29,371
Sir, Colonel Bach is on his way over here, sir.

762
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,615
I'm sure he is.

763
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,891
It sounded like a world-class shit-fit, sir.

764
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,771
I'm sure it is, Sergeant.

765
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:45,817
- Come on, move it.
- What are these sheep doing here?

766
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,327
- I bought them.
- You can't do that!

767
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,258
- Well, I did.
- There are no sheep specs, Colonel!

768
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,178
- I devised the specs, Major.
- What are they?

769
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:57,370
They're live and kicking,
and that's good enough for me.

770
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,697
Testing is a science, Colonel.
It needs controlled experiments.

771
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:05,971
- Just sticking sheep into a...
- All right, you don't want sheep?

772
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,537
Lennon, Chavez,
get the sheep out of there,

773
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:13,173
- and get in the Bradley. Dalton!
- Yes, sir?

774
00:57:13,219 --> 00:57:14,811
Get in the Bradley.

775
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:18,936
- Sir?
- I need a vaporifics test, get in the Bradley.

776
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,255
- Everyone inside.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

777
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,531
You think this is
some kind of joke, Colonel?

778
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,048
All right, we'll just use the sheep.
That's a terrific idea.

779
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:32,772
Use the sheep in the Bradley.
Go on, sheep.

780
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,288
Get in there... God damn it!

781
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:39,097
Backblast area, clear!

782
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:41,778
- On the way, sir.
- Fire!

783
00:57:52,699 --> 00:57:55,213
Oh, God, Granger, don't breathe!

784
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:59,131
- What the hell happened?
- The damn fumes!

785
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,056
Stay back!

786
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,693
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK.

787
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,333
Jesus, just one tiny whiff...

788
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,530
Did you get a look inside?

789
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,934
Nothing could have survived those fumes.

790
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,650
Sergeant, where are the sheep?

791
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:33,259
Major Sayers said they had to be incinerated.

792
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,450
- What?
- They carted them away, sir.

793
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,333
Whoa! No! Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

794
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,251
- Follow those sheep!
- Sir?

795
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:48,330
- Stop that truck, that's an order!
- Yes, sir.

796
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,778
Sergeant.

797
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,492
I need them, for autopsy.

798
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,456
To verify test results.

799
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,896
I see him, we got him, sir.

800
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,817
- Pay no attention to them!
- Sir?

801
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,657
Concentrate on the sheep.

802
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,889
Look out!

803
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:36,052
Move it!

804
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:37,498
Come on!

805
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,414
Damn it, what are you stopping us for?

806
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,132
- Stop the sheep!
- What's the hurry, sir?

807
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:55,775
Not one of the tests I've ordered
has been conducted according to plan.

808
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,934
And since my job...

809
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:01,690
Your job is to stop whining and serve
the United States as befits an officer!

810
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:06,654
My job is to oversee the joint live-fire
test programme and report to Congress.

811
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:11,011
In order to do that, I'm gonna have to insist
on a live-fire test of the Bradley

812
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:12,891
under combat conditions.

813
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,648
Listen to me, fly-boy,
you don't know shit about combat!

814
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:19,771
I know there are a lot of ways
to die in that vehicle, sir.

815
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,617
- Don't you preach to me!
- I want a realistic...

816
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:26,732
- The number one priority is...
- People first, vehicles second!!

817
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,012
Those are my priorities. The Army's
priorities seem to be the exact opposite.

818
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:33,527
You are way out of line here.

819
01:00:36,019 --> 01:00:39,807
I won't sign off on the Bradley
without a live-fire test.

820
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:53,377
- Sir?
- Who is Burton's commanding officer?

821
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,059
General De Grasso, sir.

822
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:58,010
Get him for me now.

823
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:08,414
It's an economic move, Colonel,
you're being reassigned.

824
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:13,971
In the meantime, should I... continue
in my present assignment?

825
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:17,978
Your present assignment
has been eliminated, Colonel.

826
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:20,853
I didn't think my job could be eliminated.

827
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,853
- I was appointed by Congress.
- But you're paid by the Army.

828
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:31,092
If they can't afford you - and they can't -
you have no job.

829
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,851
Colonel, it's time to move on.

830
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,496
Let's not let this little blip on the screen
ground you permanently.

831
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:19,253
Would the Colonel ever consider
having a drink with an enlisted soldier?

832
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,849
Does the enlisted soldier
think the Colonel needs one?

833
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:27,614
- What are they gonna do, fire you?
- OK, just a little one.

834
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,576
You know what's really ironic?

835
01:02:55,539 --> 01:03:00,329
General Omar Bradley was a brilliant tactician
and a great leader.

836
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,530
No ego, just did the job.

837
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,217
And he looked out for the morale
and the safety of his men.

838
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,411
And they go and put his name on this thing!

839
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,291
Talk about a kick in the ass.

840
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,457
The closest the brass ever get to a battlefield

841
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,378
is the first tee on a Saturday morning.

842
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,410
You know, Fanning...

843
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:29,292
I've been around long enough to know
that the Pentagon is not a charity,

844
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,898
it's cashflows and egos.

845
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:35,409
That's part of it, it's what helps drive it,
fine, but...

846
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,137
somehow...

847
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,648
somehow I always thought the men came first.

848
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:51,177
I always thought that the people on top knew

849
01:03:51,219 --> 01:03:54,256
that it was about the soldier in the field.

850
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,775
You gave it your best shot.

851
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:02,054
- Did I?
- Yes, sir, you did.

852
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:10,097
Well, now it's somebody else's problem.

853
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:15,528
My problem is salvaging my career.

854
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:20,938
Which apparently is not beyond repair
if I'm a good little boy.

855
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,019
So, that's it.

856
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:26,572
That's it.

857
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:29,179
The man said, "war is hell".

858
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,336
He should've tried peacetime.

859
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:37,615
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, be my guest.

860
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:39,809
I don't believe in government waste.

861
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,019
- Burton.
- So they're moving you out?

862
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,215
Is there anything you don't hear about?

863
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,969
Well, how far are you willing to go
with this thing?

864
01:04:57,019 --> 01:05:00,978
The question is...
how far are they going to send me?

865
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:04,456
You ought to take a trip to California
this weekend.

866
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,094
I'm not up for a vacation right now.

867
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:10,257
No one goes to Fresno
for a vacation, Colonel.

868
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,332
- Can I help you, sir?
- Colonel Burton.

869
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,099
I'm here to see the project manager.

870
01:06:11,019 --> 01:06:13,010
- Colonel Burton?
- Yes.

871
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,856
Steve Johnson, project manager.

872
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,891
Hi, thank you.

873
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,534
All set, let's go!

874
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:29,616
What's going on here?
Who changed the specs?

875
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:31,058
The Israelis.

876
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:33,897
The Israelis? When?

877
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,931
When they placed their order.

878
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,975
- So these are for export?
- Yes.

879
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:41,739
- All of them?
- Yes, Colonel.

880
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:46,057
You're telling me we're manufacturing
two different versions of this vehicle?

881
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:49,887
The Israelis wouldn't take the Bradley
as designed, Colonel.

882
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,659
They wanted the fuel tanks on the outside,

883
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:55,771
reinforced armour,
a different ventilation system...

884
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,289
All right.
What about the specs for our Bradleys?

885
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:03,458
Exactly like the ones
you're testing, Colonel. No change.

886
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:30,652
- You think you were followed?
- Followed?

887
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:33,896
I drove for hours.
I don't even know where we are.

888
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,296
Maybe you'd prefer to meet
at the officers' club?

889
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,610
- When did the Israelis test it?
- They didn't have to,

890
01:07:41,659 --> 01:07:45,288
they knew by looking at it
that it was a deathtrap.

891
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,173
So while we're sending our guys off to die,

892
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:52,007
the Pentagon brass is redesigning
the damn thing for somebody else!

893
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:55,096
They can't sell it overseas like it is.

894
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,730
Business as usual.

895
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:07,969
So maybe you'd like to keep
fighting the bastards?

896
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:14,619
I've lost my job, General.
They're moving me out.

897
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:18,811
So, they're moving you out,
you haven't been discharged.

898
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:22,215
Work from inside,
from wherever they send you.

899
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,694
And turn into you?

900
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:29,534
Passing anonymous notes
and meeting in parking lots?

901
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:35,329
You're great at sitting in the shadows.
Why don't you do something?

902
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,371
I can't.

903
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:41,015
- Help me!
- I have done everything that I can.

904
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,813
I've been fighting this for almost 20 years.

905
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,818
I'm not gonna go to the mat over this!
I... I've got too much to lose.

906
01:08:55,779 --> 01:08:57,690
70,000 troops.

907
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:03,251
70,000 American boys
will ride into battle in the Bradley

908
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,369
if America fights another war.

909
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,855
We can't be a part of
sending them to their deaths.

910
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,856
One call.

911
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,256
- What?
- One call.

912
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,291
I'll make one call and that's it.

913
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,097
Sit down.

914
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,137
General Partridge, you've read
today's Washington Post?

915
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,454
- I have.
- And seen the story,

916
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,457
attributed to a highly placed Pentagon source?

917
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:49,528
Yes, and I am as distressed as you that
anyone in the Pentagon would stoop so low.

918
01:09:49,579 --> 01:09:53,413
Leaks within the Pentagon
are how I get most of my information.

919
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:57,498
Are you suggesting that
the Pentagon is less than forthcoming?

920
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:01,613
Then perhaps you can explain
why I have to learn from the press

921
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:05,698
that the man in charge
of testing the Bradley has been fired?

922
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:10,248
- He wasn't fired, sir, he was reassigned.
- By whom?

923
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,257
By General De Grasso,
his commanding officer.

924
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,494
I'm as shocked as you are.

925
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:19,738
I guess there was some confusion
between the Army, the Air Force...

926
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:22,088
The sort of trouble you always get

927
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,894
with these cross-departmental
joint-testing programmes.

928
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,452
- Yes.
- Congressman Stratton is on the phone.

929
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,332
Sam, what can I do for you?

930
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,132
What article? Oh, that article.

931
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,331
No, completely untrue, inter-office SNAFU.

932
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,609
File it under creative journalism.

933
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:54,131
I'm looking into it now,
you'll be the first to know. Right. Right.

934
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,976
My best to Ellen.

935
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,252
General, I want a full update on the Bradley

936
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,211
- and I want it in writing.
- Right away, sir.

937
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:14,611
That is the last call
I expect to receive on this matter

938
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:19,413
from Congressman Stratton
or anyone else on the Hill.

939
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,210
Do I make myself clear, General?

940
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,851
Perfectly.

941
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,854
Colonel Burton, I want you to write
your report on the Bradley.

942
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:50,971
Sir? I was under the impression
that my job had...

943
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,011
Your job has been reinstated.

944
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,257
I want your report on my desk
by 1800 hours tomorrow.

945
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,337
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, in case you are unaware,

946
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,975
as per the military manual, you will deliver
your report to me and to me alone.

947
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,569
Should a single copy be made public,
I will charge you with

948
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:11,771
subversion of military procedure
and have you court-martialled.

949
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,896
Stop packing, we're staying.

950
01:12:34,939 --> 01:12:38,375
- How'd you do that?
- I didn't do anything.

951
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,980
- Do we have a rule book?
- A rule book, sir?

952
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:44,376
- A book with rules in it.
- What do you need a rule book for?

953
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,537
To play by the rules,
cos I always play by the rules.

954
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:51,538
Then why do you need a rule book
to tell you what the rules are?

955
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:56,175
I need a rule book to tell me which rules I...
Just get me the book.

956
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,615
You need anything else, sir?
Chinese food, No-Doz?

957
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:27,854
No, thank you, Sergeant, I'm fine.

958
01:13:28,699 --> 01:13:30,530
Well, then, night, sir.

959
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,694
What sounds better?

960
01:13:33,739 --> 01:13:37,255
"The Bradley has so far
failed virtually every test"

961
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,689
or "The testing program of the Bradley

962
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:42,537
"has been without any coherent standards"?

963
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,856
They both sound like something
the General wouldn't want in his report.

964
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:51,528
This is not just a report,
it's a deadly weapon.

965
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:54,777
Sir, an M-16 is a deadly weapon.

966
01:13:54,819 --> 01:13:56,889
A report is just a pile of paper,

967
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:00,898
unless you plan to inflict
a lot of extremely vicious paper cuts.

968
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:02,817
Go home, Sergeant.

969
01:14:02,859 --> 01:14:04,737
Good night, sir.

970
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:17,769
"The failure of the Bradley to incorporate
even the most elementary safeguards

971
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:22,131

972

- Rewrite it!
- Sir?

01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:09,132
Rewrite the fucking piece of garbage
so it smells like a rose!

983

01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,177
Thank you, sir.

997
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,859
- But, sir...
- What?

998
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:24,380
What does it mean?

999
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,332
What do you mean, what does it mean?
You wrote it.

1000
01:16:31,699 --> 01:16:33,690
- Afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

1001
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:38,574
"The Bradley tests have been
extremely consistent."

1002
01:16:38,619 --> 01:16:41,930
This thing is exactly the opposite
of what you wrote.

1003
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:43,617
How can they do that?

1004
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:46,127
They're playing by the book, Sergeant,

1005
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,136
and so am I.

1006
01:16:49,579 --> 01:16:51,376
Paper cuts...

1007
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,057
vicious paper cuts.

1008
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:12,694
"The characterisation in your report
is at best a serious misunderstanding

1009
01:17:12,739 --> 01:17:17,416
"of the testing procedures
on a vehicle as flawed as the Bradley.

1010
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,690
"As noted in my original report,
the integrity..."

1011
01:17:21,619 --> 01:17:25,168
Jesus Christ! Who did this fucking thing go to?

1012
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,337
The distribution page listed 198 names.

1013
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,690
Court-martial the son of a bitch!
Lock him up now!

1014
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:34,128
- We can't.
- We sure as hell can!

1015
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:37,092
Burton's report was classified,
it was sent to you,

1016
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,335
you revised it and sent it back to him.

1017
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,449
He wrote a memo on your revision

1018
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,856
which can be sent to anyone
remotely involved with the Bradley.

1019
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:48,208
In this case, 198 people.

1020
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,456
I will fucking kill him.

1021
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,287
I will fillet him, draw and quarter him,
stick his head in a vice.

1022
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:59,775
We can't touch him, sir. It's by the book.

1023
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:03,858
Then you find something in that book
that'll help me fry the son of a bitch!

1024
01:18:03,899 --> 01:18:05,298
What?

1025
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,773
Sir, the Washington Post is on the phone.

1026
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:15,572
That was fast. Leaks don't usually
get to them till after lunch.

1027
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:20,574
Yes. No, we cannot comment
on that right now.

1028
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:22,211
Yes?

1029
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,854
No, he cannot comment on that.

1030
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:29,256
I'm sorry, but under military rules,
I'm unable to comment.

1031
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,096
I... I can't comment.

1032
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,654
No. No, no comment.

1033
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:38,094
Sorry, goodbye.

1034
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,938
I'm getting lockjaw from not saying anything.

1035
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,699
Burton.

1036
01:18:45,739 --> 01:18:48,697
I... I can't comment.

1037
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,014
Is there anything I can comment on?

1038
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,331
Well, yes.

1039
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:02,128
I've just received orders
that I am to report for duty in... Alaska.

1040
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:06,536
Alaska is a prestige posting, Senator.

1041
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:09,935
No, no, no,
I assure you that memo of his

1042
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:13,289
had nothing to do with his being transferred.

1043
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:17,730
Senator, I'm sorry, I've just been informed
Secretary Weinberger is on the other line.

1044
01:19:17,779 --> 01:19:21,295
I'll get right back to you.
I promise, thank you.

1045
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:25,015
Sir, Weinberger is on two,
line one is the Times.

1046
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,813
Three is the Wall Street Journal,
four is Newsweek,

1047
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:31,613
line five is the House
Armed Services Committee.

1048
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:33,615
What do they want?

1049
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,333
Hearings, sir. On the Bradley.

1050
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,499
Alaska?

1051
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:48,452
- What?
- I said Alaska, General.

1052
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:53,976
As I said in my opening remarks,
Madam Chairman,

1053
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,695
a lot of things have to come together
to create teamwork.

1054
01:20:58,539 --> 01:21:03,135
- Good old-fashioned teamwork.
- Yes, you told us, General.

1055
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,456
And Colonel Burton's not a team player,

1056
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,060
he's a rogue operator.

1057
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,534
I'm not a name-caller, Madam Chairman.

1058
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:15,538
But if you wish to make that connection,
that would be your choice, not mine.

1059
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,615
Did you ever say to Colonel Burton

1060
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:22,733
"If I get one more call from the Hill
about your, uh, expletive deleted, reports,

1061
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:25,054
"you'll be sitting on your brains"?

1062
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,934
- Does that sound like me, sir?
- Answer the question, General, please.

1063
01:21:28,979 --> 01:21:32,494
I don't remember saying it.
Not that I wasn't provoked.

1064
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:37,893
Two witnesses testified that you said
those words to Colonel Burton

1065
01:21:37,939 --> 01:21:40,089
outside the Pentagon pharmacy.

1066
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,813
I have visited the pharmacy.

1067
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:45,817
Quite a bit lately for antacids.

1068
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:52,259
But I would never say
anything like that to anyone.

1069
01:21:52,899 --> 01:21:55,174
Let alone a fellow officer.

1070
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,769
But what about your antagonism
towards Colonel Burton?

1071
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:02,414
It's his report that I don't approve of.

1072
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:09,016
Colonel Burton's report is fallacious,
misinformed, and accusatory.

1073
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:15,135
And I have no use for an officer who is
more interested in grabbing headlines

1074
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,740
than he is in defending this country.

1075
01:22:21,579 --> 01:22:23,490
I thought he was in Anchorage.

1076
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:30,377
Madam Chairman, Colonel Burton's here.

1077
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,052
The committee would like to call as witness

1078
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,490
Colonel James G Burton,
United States Air Force.

1079
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:42,050
- Madam Chairman.
- Yes, General?

1080
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,776
Under the rules of military conduct,
no man can appear at these hearings

1081
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:50,414
without the express order
of his commanding officer.

1082
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,975
Unfortunately, General De Grasso
is on a tour in Germany.

1083
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:58,252
General De Grasso has not ordered
Colonel Burton to testify.

1084
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,090
You're quite right, but as Colonel Burton
has been transferred to Alaska,

1085
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,416
he's no longer under
General De Grasso's command.

1086
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,451
Am I correct?

1087
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:39,177
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth

1088
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,414
- so help you God?
- I do.

1089
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:46,372
Looks like you've stirred up
a hornet's nest, Colonel.

1090
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,694
It was never my intention, ma'am.

1091
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:50,650
What was your intention?

1092
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:55,331
Simply to do the job I was assigned to do.

1093
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:03,618
The Army test reports do not make
the possibility of casualties a top priority.

1094
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:07,938
In fact, General Partridge's
report on the Bradley

1095
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:10,652
doesn't even mention the word casualty,

1096
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:12,417
not once.

1097
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:18,489
I came to the conclusion that
what was required was a live-fire test.

1098
01:24:18,539 --> 01:24:21,815
I requested such a test, repeatedly.

1099
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:26,378
- Did you get that test?
- No, ma'am, I did not.

1100
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,819
Why not?

1101
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:31,932
I wanted more realism than Army testing
was accustomed to providing.

1102
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:34,447
You want realism?

1103
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,649
General, you are out of order!

1104
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:40,931
Madam Chairman, in the interest
of resolving some of these issues,

1105
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:43,209
I'd like to say something.

1106
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,251
Please be brief, General.

1107
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:49,131
Of course.

1108
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:56,293
Colonel Burton wants more realism,
so let's talk about the real world.

1109
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,775
The real world has enemies in it.

1110
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:05,050
There are forces at work,
even now as we speak

1111
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:11,096
with one objective in mind -
the destruction of this country.

1112
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,378
We must not, we will not
allow those forces to prevail,

1113
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:20,458
for if we do,
you can be certain that you and I,

1114
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,652
and everyone else
will never again enjoy the luxury

1115
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:27,896
of meeting in this building
to debate anything!

1116
01:25:27,939 --> 01:25:31,852
As I said at the outset,
we are in the business of winning.

1117
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:35,413
That takes teamwork.

1118
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:43,497
General, the teamwork you so prize,
I take it it was in full force

1119
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:46,337
during the development of the Bradley?

1120
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,971
Textbook!

1121
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:52,574
Perhaps you'd like to tell us
how much has been spent so far

1122
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:55,087
to develop the Bradley?

1123
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,131
How much?

1124
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:59,899
Well, you have the figures, don't you?

1125
01:25:59,939 --> 01:26:01,657
Of course.

1126
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,699
14.

1127
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,128
- More or less.
- 14.

1128
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:49,170
- 14.
- Million?

1129
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:51,537
Bill... ion.

1130
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,649
What did you say, General?

1131
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:01,019
Billion.

1132
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:07,132
Billion... with a B?

1133
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,090
With a B.

1134
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:16,935
$14 billion for designing
one armoured vehicle?

1135
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,456
That's one way of looking at it.

1136
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,377
Of taxpayers' money.

1137
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:29,207
We are all taxpayers, after all.
We're in this together.

1138
01:27:29,739 --> 01:27:32,856
General, how many years
has this programme been running?

1139
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:42,490
Bear with me, just a moment.

1140
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:45,054
Um... er...

1141
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,091
Let me... Ah.

1142
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,375
Let's see. 12, 15...

1143
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:56,052
- 17.
- What?

1144
01:27:57,699 --> 01:27:59,530
17.

1145
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:03,207
Which is evidence...

1146
01:28:04,699 --> 01:28:08,328
of the enormous care my team takes

1147
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:13,818
in the development of every weapons system
undertaken by the Pentagon.

1148
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,892
Hm.

1149
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:19,611
17 years.

1150
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:26,168
$14 billion of the taxpayers' money.

1151
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:29,769
General, I think it's time
the American public

1152
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:33,938
gets the live-fire test
that Colonel Burton wants.

1153
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:45,210
- Tomorrow's the big day, sir.
- Uh-huh.

1154
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:48,930
I'll tell you one thing.

1155
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:53,131
Every damn one of these nuts and bolts
has been taken off and put back on again.

1156
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:00,452
This wouldn't be flame retardant, would it?

1157
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:04,890
You think they made the men
trick this whole thing up?

1158
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,449
It wouldn't surprise me.

1159
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,091
Not a bit.

1160
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,579
Room, attention.

1161
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,177
At ease, gentlemen.

1162
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,411
Looks like you've been working hard.

1163
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,536
- Corporal.
- Sir?

1164
01:29:40,579 --> 01:29:42,649
Let me have one of those M-16s.

1165
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,496
I wanna tell you a story.

1166
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:51,810
You got a problem with that, Sergeant?

1167
01:29:53,699 --> 01:29:55,655
No, sir.

1168
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:59,010
About a year ago,
I went to the veterans' hospital

1169
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,018
to visit a friend of mine
from my flying days.

1170
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,809
Only I took a wrong turn
when I got off the elevator.

1171
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:09,976
Now, when I look back on it,

1172
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,375
I think I was meant to go down that corridor.

1173
01:30:13,939 --> 01:30:16,578
Cos that's where I met Phil.

1174
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:22,614
Thank you, Corporal.

1175
01:30:22,659 --> 01:30:26,288
- But, sir...
- Let me finish, Dalton.

1176
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:32,372
I want to pass on something
I learned about the M-16 from Phil.

1177
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,650
You all know the M-16 better than I do.

1178
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:39,408
A lot of you used it in Vietnam.
But you were lucky.

1179
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,817
In the early days of that war,

1180
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:47,330
they sent guys off to fight
with M-16s that jammed in combat.

1181
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:52,773
A little bit of dust, a little bit of rain,
and the gun was useless.

1182
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:57,456
Maybe those early M-16s
weren't tested properly.

1183
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,649
Maybe somebody somewhere
was more worried

1184
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:03,931
about a production schedule or a promotion

1185
01:31:03,979 --> 01:31:07,892
than he was about those grunts
in some faraway jungle,

1186
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:11,534
who might end up with
their stomachs in their hands.

1187
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:19,368
But you don't know anyone
that happened to, do you?

1188
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,810
No. I'm sure not.

1189
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:24,975
Otherwise you'd be out there right now

1190
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:29,615
making sure that that Bradley
is exactly - and I mean exactly -

1191
01:31:29,659 --> 01:31:34,096
the way it would be
under normal combat conditions.

1192
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:38,292
With some of your buddies
riding inside, guys like Phil.

1193
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:43,971
Only Phil has been in a coma
for the last 20 years.

1194
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:48,252
Since the day his M-16 jammed
somewhere outside of Vinh Long.

1195
01:31:50,979 --> 01:31:53,652
But hell, you don't know the guy.

1196
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,899
Or anybody like him.

1197
01:32:00,779 --> 01:32:02,292
Right?

1198
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:55,528
Sir?

1199
01:32:55,579 --> 01:32:57,934
Over here!

1200
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,609
- General!
- Good morning, sir.

1201
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:10,457
- Everything all right?
- Fine, sir, just fine.

1202
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,177
Keep coming. Keep coming. Keep coming.

1203
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,893
A little more. Keep coming. Keep coming.

1204
01:33:22,939 --> 01:33:24,930
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

1205
01:33:27,859 --> 01:33:30,327
- Everything all right, Sergeant?
- Fine, sir.

1206
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,018
- Thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

1207
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,891
Welcome, Sergeant.

1208
01:33:49,659 --> 01:33:52,890
Jeez. Looks like some party.

1209
01:33:59,619 --> 01:34:01,814
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

1210
01:34:02,539 --> 01:34:04,052
Thank you.

1211
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:08,772
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished members of Congress.

1212
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:13,131
I think it's fair to say that
you'll be seeing enough from this test

1213
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:17,412
to give you the basis once and for all
to form your own conclusion

1214
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:22,170
about the sort of systemic excellence
we've been pursuing.

1215
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,289
I will be giving the signal shortly.

1216
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:29,573
When I do, I want you
to visualise combat conditions.

1217
01:34:29,619 --> 01:34:33,898
Imagine that the men firing that round
are the enemy.

1218
01:34:33,939 --> 01:34:38,217
And that the Bradley,
I don't have to tell you...

1219
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,454
the Bradley is on our side.

1220
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:44,573
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished members of Congress,

1221
01:34:44,619 --> 01:34:47,692
I give you your Bradley fighting vehicle.

1222
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,251
Can you believe this?

1223
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,451
Sergeant.

1224
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,615
Everything's gonna go as planned, isn't it?

1225
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:12,650
It will go exactly as it should, sir.

1226
01:36:12,699 --> 01:36:14,929
As planned, right?

1227
01:36:14,979 --> 01:36:16,458
Corporal, this is Sergeant Dalton.

1228
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,855
Move the vehicle about five yards forward
and then clear out. Over.

1229
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,457
Roger that.

1230
01:36:23,659 --> 01:36:27,938
For your further edification,
the Bradley can be fired accurately...

1231
01:36:27,979 --> 01:36:31,289
How much fuel is in those tanks, Sergeant?
Just enough to do those manoeuvres?

1232
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,934
No more than it would have
if it was in combat, sir.

1233
01:36:33,979 --> 01:36:38,450
Seven TOW missiles fired
from a launcher mounted on the left side...

1234
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,573
- And the ammunition inside the Bradley?
- Up to spec, sir.

1235
01:36:42,619 --> 01:36:44,610
- Whose specs?
- Manoeuvrable,

1236
01:36:44,659 --> 01:36:48,130
- and capable of keeping pace with...
- No! No!

1237
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:52,970
Carrying infantry troops
needed to support tank operations,

1238
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,773
more than we have in the test conditions.

1239
01:36:55,819 --> 01:36:58,174
And the hour is at hand.

1240
01:36:59,899 --> 01:37:03,528
All eyes front on the Bradley fighting vehicle.

1241
01:37:03,579 --> 01:37:08,938
The vehicle that will carry our boys to victory
for many, many years to come.

1242
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,937
Backblast area clear!

1243
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,733
Fire!

1244
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,051
Who's the best, baby?

1245
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,091
Dalton, Granger!

1246
01:38:09,939 --> 01:38:12,407
- Sir.
- Sir.

1247
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,212
Could you explain, please?

1248
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:19,216
We tried to tell you, sir.

1249
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:22,935
You see, sir, when you gave us
that speech last night

1250
01:38:22,979 --> 01:38:25,812
we had already fixed the vehicle
back to the way it should be.

1251
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,091
So you were...

1252
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:36,377
- you were ahead of me.
- I don't know about ahead,

1253
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,207
but we've been behind you
ever since you fried those mannequins.

1254
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:45,612
And the sheep, sir. Man, that was epic!

1255
01:38:54,899 --> 01:38:58,255
I'm sorry I made you listen
to that lecture now, I...

1256
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:01,576
Sir, you have nothing to apologise for, sir.

1257
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:06,650
We had you figured wrong.

1258
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:10,578
The men come first with you,
and you proved that.

1259
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:13,054
It was a hell of a good speech though, sir.

1260
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:16,649
Any time you want to give another one,
you know where to find us.

1261
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:21,291
Thank you, men. Thank you, all.

1262
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:25,692
Sir.
