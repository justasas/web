with glass inside it

137
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,409
I can't see anything inside but i think
if i break the glass there might be

138
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:56,490
water inside it was to drink no water
nothing inside that all pain

139
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,750

147
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,700
I believe there is an undying birthday
Phoenix King that lives on this planet

148
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:02,630

of bird right and i believe it is only

it nearly you're right but there's one

174
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,080
problem we must sound before the Phoenix
can help pass the problem you mean an

175
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,449
