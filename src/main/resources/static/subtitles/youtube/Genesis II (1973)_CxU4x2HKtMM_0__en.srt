the day on which I died

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,320
my last look at my world was to be from

00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,359
inside a pressure chamber at NASA's

through our solar<font color="#E5E5E5"> system it had been my</font>

00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,939
decision that our method was ready to

22
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:51,728
test on a human so it seemed that any

23
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:53,258
risk should be mine too I had guided the

24
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:57,218
basic research since being appointed

perhaps my confidence in our experiment

00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,098
dated from that trip

now bridged his first continent it

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,060
seemed to me that mankind's ingenuity

build our laboratory in a deep grotto

608
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:35,210
feared they've discovered a missile site

609
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:39,130
which with full generator power they

610
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:39,130
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use against us</font>
