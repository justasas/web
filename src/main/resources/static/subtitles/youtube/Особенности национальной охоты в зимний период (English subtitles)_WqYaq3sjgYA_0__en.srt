00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,359
His name was H Thou,
and he was a great hunter.

He got in his craft
such heights

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,359
had no equal
throughout China.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,358
He grasped all the nuances
and tricks of the case.

8
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,359
Any animal or bird could
catch in snares and traps.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,358
5 times H Thou took part
in competitions

10
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,801

He wrote treatises on art 8

Pass on their knowledge to many people,

16
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:15,359
but no one could call
his disciple.

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,760
I got bored and he decided to find

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,359
worthy of his skill
and ability in other lands.

19
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:27,859

who could compare with him
in skill and knowledge of the case.

21
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:38,359
Not yet reached the end of the earth,
where all the space is covered with snow,

22
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:42,861
and winter lasted almost a year.

23
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,359
Residents of this icy country hunted

24
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:49,359
and fished so
strange ways,

25
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:54,359
that the shaken ideas and views
H Thou on the art of hunting.

26
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,359
He went into the cold forest,
and after a long wait

27
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,359
he managed to lure into their snares
just one little bird.

28
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:06,359
Then there were the people with strict
persons

29

even on a small tales
do not squeeze out.

35

Oh, someone else has arrived!

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,358
- You - the huntsman?

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,359
Olga V., in my opinion,
they are not naturists.

85
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,359
Something of their long gone. As if
polymerize not used to it.

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Yes! This change in lifestyle can
a negative impact on their health.

They long ago our Ministry

93
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,358
So what to do now?

94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,360
All! Check the full program.
Do you like with the beast?

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,358
- To run out there in the wild.
- That's right, run.

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Unfed, I suppose. Without human
heat without a care. Wildly all.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
- What happened?
- Environmentalists have come, I tell you!

98
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,358
Home at them - a woman.
I talked about it.

99
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,359
She used by the Ministry of
reclamation took place.

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,340
All men, cover holidays!

101
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:17,358
Yeah, and something very like it, nothing?

102
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,860
Yes, you did not raise such
not to hill.

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,319
Or, after the road so bathhouse
load off?

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
I opponent, and you do not advise.

105
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,360
All our troubles and suffering
But from this.

106
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,358
How could you have with nature, a ranger?

107
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Normally, one might even say -
beautiful nature.

108
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,358
Yes, we have a wonderful nature!

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Who to us nor come only:

110
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:09,360
prosecutors, generals
and all the other officials.

111
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,860
And, without exception, are
lost in admiration

112
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,110
from a modest and unassuming
our nature.

113
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,360
And destroy nature! Bonfires bundle
Trees felled.

114
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,839
- Yes Yes Yes!
- Beasts shoot.

115
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:29,341
And then wonder: no animals.

116
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,359
How else do you want to test
fat of the beast?

117
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,359
He is an animal, especially a wild,
so simple hands is not given,

118
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,320
so we can check it fat
layer, especially in the winter.

119
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,026
And this tobacco

120
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:49,360
you break the delicate balance
in our nature.

121
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Tomorrow will begin to examine in detail
your possessions.

122
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,359
Oh please! Whatever you say.

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,340
And now to bed!
Rise early in the morning.

125
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,860
They are in the yard.
How to get out - just behind Apparatchik.

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Well, what did I tell you ?!
Now, do not spit without permission.

127
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,860
How - ecological upsets.

Do not worry. Now we fix that your
health. And take off stress.

Jams have something,
that the smell was not?

So now wallowing here!

136
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,610
What do you, the huntsman is going on?
The toilet is not possible to go!

00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,359
Well, I have, of course, special
Comfort is not. But the exotic!

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
It is generally quiet,
Only very curious!

146
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,359
Yes. In time the den does not lay down,
That run hither.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,759
And before you here, all of
Prosecutor General's Office arrived!

This is a hangover and suffering!

From this, and to do for you.
For compassion, maybe.

151

Who is it?

152
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,359
Bear seven years.

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,840
Six yet.
I've been watching him since birth.

154
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,341
Precocious and outgoing.

155
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,860
- What is it with you?

156
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360

Oh, do not fuss, Yataro.

167
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Who drinks, he does not understand life.

168
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,860
But she was right.

169
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,359
Well, that and will sit dry?

170
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,359
Norsemen, pour!

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,359
And what are you doing
sitting in the suburbs?

172
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Yes, I can not! In the
morning I will suffer.

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,359
Oh, do not worry about it.

174
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,360
I've got this air
and the purity of the natural,

175
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
that as the baby wake up.

176
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,319
- Well, then as a second?
- I was then in a saucer.

177
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,359
For conspiracy.

178
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,159
Mich absolutely right.

179
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,759
And do not worry about the head,
It will not hurt.

180
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,860
- Well, how?
- Thank you, Olga V.. Excellent!

181
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,860
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

182
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,860
- Everything is now all!
- We have work to do.

183
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,759
Just a minute, Yuri.

184
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,360
Please wait a little.
I quickly.

185
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,860
Good morning everybody!

186
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,359
I am in Japan, "rock garden"
Kyoto visited.

187
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,860
Honestly, I did not understand.

188
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Whether it was hot, or we have lunch
warm sake was accepted. I fell asleep.

189
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,860
Yuri, free!

190
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,860
Yuri, free!

191
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,860
Yuri?

192
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,359
Yuri, and what are they?

193
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,840
A nonsense. Mind and meditation
the head can not be cured. Will not work!

194
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:47,320
You see here, Igor, find us some
schoolchild. Cabbage better.

195
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,860
- Cabbage?
- Yeah, better than cabbage. Our!

196
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,359
Following, following steps! Boggy swamp!

197
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,359
- Mich!
- A?

198
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,359
- And you can walk narrower?
- I can!

199
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,860
- Carefully, Olga V.!
- So why do you not step?

200
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,360
Boggy swamp! Here in the spring
Geologists have two tractors sucked!

201
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:18,860
Next in the trail to go. Over bumps.

202
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Haste thee not. I am afraid
that by the night it’ll turn.

203
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Lord. Drink no one, eh?

204
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,860
- On.
- Yeah.

205
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,320
Thank you. Well, let's go?
Why waste time to lose ?!

206
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,860
Why stand? Come on!
Follow me!

207
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,360
- Mich! Large field! - What did you say!
Three of Monaco will get!

208
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,360
- And what is there to grow?
- Sedge, lichen, moss! Swamp it!

209
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,860
A solid!

210
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Oh, judging by the trail of the beast is.
And who's gone?

211
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,319
Vole ran.
And over there - weevil.

212
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,159
And who is this weevil?

213
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,859
Weevil - a small
local predators.

214
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,860
Maybe the fire dissolve, rotogravure?

215
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,358
Bonfires only destroy nature.

216
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,319
Yes, it would not hurt to get warm.
There's still something to drink?

217
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,358
What is it?

218
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,859
- Tea.
- Give!

219
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,339
- It is not tea.
- What?

220
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,840
- Cognac.
- Can not be!

221
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,859
- Come on, will soon begin to darken.
- Exactly!

222
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,358
- Mich!
- A?

223
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,359
But wait you! Where?
Where the road leads, in the end?

224
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:23,360
- Well, there - on a military
training ground. - So.

225
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,359
- And there - in my cordon.
- So.

226
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,358
A stone's throw!
12 kilometers left.

227
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,358
Ivan Susan in, we could here
by car to get there?

228
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,359
Of course, can! But you yourself
I want to see my land.

229
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,359
Here I have shown and their possessions.

230
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,358
Two of Luxembourg with a tail
almost will.

231
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,358
In my opinion, we all three passed.

232
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,358
Do not understand. And where...?

233
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,319
Mich, well, you ...
The original, great master!

234
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,359
I would say - only the original.

235
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,359
- Do not understand!
- Yes, what is there not to understand?

236
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,359
What the banana you shook us swamps
and snow?

237
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:05,360
I have all the legs, on the ears, erased!

238
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:09,359
You've got all of these?
Large? Originals?

239
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,319
No, I do not understand! You also had four!
Where is this - a little?

240
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,358
Yataro.

241
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,859
Dimes! Where are you?

242
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,859
Yataro, to me!

243
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,358
Oleg!

244
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:37,319
- His traces are still there!
- Where are you?

245
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,859
Dimes!

246
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,358
Oleg!

247
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,359
Grandiloquent us to contact them,
Yuri!

248
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:57,359
- Yataro!
- Where the predators are there?

249
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,319
There is. Vaughn, took a pair of wolves.
But it's still morning.

250
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,358
Dimes!

251
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,859
- I think his track.
- Oleg!

252
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:19,360
- Oh, gone!
- Yataro!

253
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:23,359
Quietly you be quiet!

254
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,358
- Well, there it?
- He slept.

255
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:31,359
What is it? Dimes! I lay down to sleep!
Snoring! Now I'll get you!

256
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,359
- Well, he was there, alive?
- A living, breathing!

257
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:43,359
Oleg! Climb!

258
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,358
Now I'm gonna get you!

259
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:51,359
Dimes, and Come on, get out!
Always with you nothing but trouble!

260
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:54,359
- In my opinion, he's not alone.
- Trouble.

261
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,359
- Get out. Get out immediately.
- And who is he?

262
00:20:56,361 --> 00:21:00,861
Well, he was there, Olga V.?

263
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,358
There's a bear.

264
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,358
Yuri.

265
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,358
- Oleg. Yataro.

266
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,358
- Get out slowly.
- Olga V.!

267
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,359
- Come on, come out! Faster!
- I have someone holding the leg!

268
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,360
- Do not Such you down! Not Jeri beast!
- Come on, come on!

269
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,359
- Who?
- Huntsman!

270
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,359
- Not Jeri it!
- Yes, can I help!

271
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,360
- I was someone's leg holds.

272
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:26,359
Yes, I say, do not hit the bear
in the face!

273
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,859
- Bear ?!
- Do not hit in the face with a bear down!

274
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,359
- Yes, drag, drag me!
- Yuri! Keep up!

275
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:38,360
- Where are you going?
- Igor, one do not run away!

276
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,359
You get lost.

277
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,359
Olga V., run after me!

278
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,359
Why be afraid?

279
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,358
- He's home.
- Do not Eli beast!

280
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,359
- Faster, Olga V.!
- Keep a bear!

281
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,840
Do not hurt the animal!

282
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,358
Protect nature, Mich!

283
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,859
Stop! Freeze!

284
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,859
Well, and this is lost.

285
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,319
Good dog, beautiful.
F! F! F!

286
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,859
Get out!

287
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,358
Mikhail, in my opinion,
it's not cordon Mich.

288
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,359
Machinery, doggy some strange.

289
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:35,359
No, Mich cordon.

290
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,859
I've walked around - "rock garden"
in place.

291
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,358
Yes, with our uncertain
Russian life

292
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,743
anyone can build yourself

293
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:49,319
not only the "rock garden"
but whatever came.

294
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,859
I mean, unbridled imagination
people went.

295
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,358
Especially far from cultural centers.

296
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,319
This marginalized and alone all
Anything can take a notion in his head.

297
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,935
My professional experience
She suggests:

298
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,319
Mich 4 people at a party.

299
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,359
And one of them - a woman.
So that a shelter can go Mikhail.

300
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:22,359
Can, if only without women.

301
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,358
Oh I reached.

302
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,358
Hi, Mich!

303
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,358
- Health, Mich!
- Bath, bath, cook!

304
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,358
- I.E?
- We have a strong one frostbitten.

305
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,359
And maybe all four.
Oh, they should rub snow!

306
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:41,860
Wow, barely overlook!
Especially one - hard!

307
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:44,950
Who hard? What are you doing?
To shoot someone, huh?

308
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,474
Well no. These are my guests. Barely
through the forest they gathered.

309
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:49,434
Well, come on, come on! Help, help!
3:10 00: 23: 51.360 ->

310
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,383
00: 23: 54.360 Well, no need
to rub snow - will not help.

311
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:56,359
Why - the right remedy.

312
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,359
They need hot water.
Do you have suitable containers?

313
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:04,360
Well there is. Japanese bath, wood.
Furor called.

314
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,359
I have it as a gift from Japan sent.

315
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,692
The idea is that all will be included.
If no complexes.

316
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:11,359
There is one woman.

317
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:15,861
Well, not to the complex!

318
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,359
Mich, come quickly, there is still
one stirred.

319
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:37,861
- Now I go!
- I got warmed. You can stand it.

320
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,358
Where is it? Aha!

321
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:59,358
Hello? No, it's not Yataro.
He can not talk right now.

322
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,319
Call hassock through the pipe.
Maybe it departs. Aha! Till!

323
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,358
Hello, hello!

324
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,359
What are you doing? You what ?!
You what ?! You hand it to blossom?

325
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:26,360
I'll show you! I was with the men bare
in the tub to keep ?!

326
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:29,359
This is not a tub, and the present
Japanese furor!

327
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,359
- It furor.
- I as a gift from Japan sent.

328
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:34,359
I do not care,
where the tub, the audacity!

329
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,358
- Natural Japanese tree.
- Yes, we have them taken out!

330
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,359
Who knew ?! Oh sorry! Who knew
before you move away ?!

331
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:42,359
He has become a move!

332
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,359
I know that there they move!
From this and woke up!

333
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:48,360
- Me? With the naked man?
- Mikhail!

334
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:52,359
As you were!

335
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,859
You would have been in the heat, and
that in fact, and You can catch a cold.

336
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,339
Who are you?

337
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,840
Leo I am!

338
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,358
Olga V., you remind me
a lady,

339
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:24,319
I have served in the division
instructor in unarmed combat.

340
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,358
So ...

341
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,358
Yes, I'm sorry, I'll call back later.

342
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,358
On the hunt here?

343
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:41,319
Why, I dropped a couple of days off -
We decided to rest.

344
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,358
To shoot innocent animals?

345
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,359
Wow, innocent!

346
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:52,360
And who of the innocent bear I ran
through the forest, but the whole night?

347
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:58,861
It is another matter! We protect nature,
and you silhouette it for fun!

348
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:04,320
- Yes Yes Yes!
- Yes, we hunt! It's a sport.

349
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,359
Well, not necessarily
shoot the animals.

350
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,360
In fact, we do not do this.

351
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,359
- Yes.
- We appreciate the process.

352
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,358
- That's it.
- An introduction to the world of nature.

353
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:22,359
Here you can see for yourself.
Tomorrow, we invite you for a wild boar.

354
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,358
- On whom?
- Wild boar.

355
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,358
Here is the migration path
boars.

356
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,358
They cordon through my neighbors go.

357
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,859
We, too, let's go!

358
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,039
Can I go on migration
see Olga V.?

359
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,358
Black Raven,

360
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,859

361
00:27:51,861 --> 00:27:56,359

362
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:00,359
- Mikhail, Holocene positivity?
- Yeah!

363
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:06,361
You production will not wait,

364
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:13,361
black raven, I'm not yours.

365
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:20,340
You production will not wait,

366
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:26,319
black raven, I'm not yours.

367
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,859
Stop!

368
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,358
Arrived! Hence the numbers stand!

369
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,359
I'm sorry, then I call back.

370
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:54,360
We have now just arrived
to track the migration of wild boars.

371
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:57,359
Okay, then explain.

372
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,359
Put the car into the bushes. The motor can
be do not turn off, that he is not afraid.

373
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:06,861
- But not to make noises!
- Good.

374
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,358
Yes? I can not talk right now.
I just stand on the issue.

375
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,332
Yes, I do not know on what.
I recognize - and then call back.

376
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:26,320
Sorry, Olga V..

377
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,359
Lou, how are you?

378
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:34,359
Quiet. Till.

379
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,339
- A Mikhail where?
- There.

380
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,840
- Where?
- I'm here Mich!

381
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,358
Well, whatever our guests?

382
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,359
Do not worry, I'll put them in the road.
They quietly. Kazan not walk.

383
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:51,861
- Well, no fluff you a pen!
- Yeah!

384
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,358
Just environmentalists.

385
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,339
Forgive me, Olga V..
I have weak lungs.

386
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,840
Should drink less! And do not climb
in snowdrifts the bears!

387
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,358
This accident. I do not understand,
How did it happen.

388
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,359
Well, quiet!
That shout - a wild boar is on the way.

389
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:17,359
- And where?
- Still far.

390
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,358
But hearing his amazing.
And the scent is not deprived.

391
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,319
This is a special ointment - sodium.
In order not to irritate the beast.

392
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,358
- It's getting dark.
- Yes.

393
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,358
Like them in the dark, you'll see?

394
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,358
How, how - the eyes red.

395
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,665
Clothes rubbing is not necessary,
Only open body.

396
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,319
He is not afraid of the smell.

397
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,859
Special ointment sodium.
The spirit of human discourage.

398
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,859
But the car you're so vain
close set.

399
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,359
Nothing was too late. You can scare,
you know.

400
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,359
What kind of ointment? Spruce smells!

401
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,359
Fir! But the main component -
their feces.

402
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:14,861
- Whose?
- Boars naturally.

403
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,859
- Olga V., you cold?
- And no.

404
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,319
Let's go to the car. From the living
room as well the road is clear and warm.

405
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,358
I feel empty, no animals.

406
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,319
Just nothing like shit plastered.
Sorry, Yuri.

407
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,319
In the cold ointment person he pulled.
The skin itches.

408
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,359
Organic any.
Olga V., want?

409
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:18,861
Yataro, look!

410
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,358
You see, over there?
Wisps of red?

411
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,359
Mich said that he had in the dark
eyes red.

412
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:29,359
Said.

413
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,859
Strange somehow glances at us,
like winks.

414
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:40,360
Squints. We spotted. What to do
we, Olga V.?

415
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:43,359
Only strange it all.

416
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,358
We have two-geek, normal
a man sitting here,

417
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,359
covered with the devil knows what, in
the car. In anticipation of a reptile.

418
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:57,360
But are you in vain, we're on the hunt.

419
00:32:57,361 --> 00:33:01,861
Sorry, Yuri.

420
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,359
That is, they began to shoot?
Boar on the approach!

421
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:21,861
I went beast! Who shot?

422
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,359
Who scared of the beast?

423
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:30,861
Something wrong.

424
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,859
Kazan went. Handsomely!

425
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,358
Look heap. Exactly on the roof.

426
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,359
Judging by their appearance,
wheelbarrow end.

427
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,360
- Be careful!
- Caution!

428
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,359
- And then who?
- We!

429
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,859
Who are we? Environmentalists, too?

430
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:57,359
- Yes!
- I Yataro!

431
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,359
- You are safe?
- Intact, only lie uncomfortable!

432
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,359
What happened?

433
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,358
What happened, what happened!
Kazan migrated.

434
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,359
And in his way, not made
sonnet!

435
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:08,360
Reach us as quickly here!

436
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,359
- The cake! - Mich, I'm afraid,
to not dig up in the morning.

437
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,359
- Who shot?
- Who shot?

438
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,358
We! We shot a wild boar!

439
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,360
In a wild boar? You've been in the car all
glass landed!

440
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,358
- Just have not ruined!
- Excuse me!

441
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,760
Olga V.,
You lie comfortably?

442
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
But how to pick out them out?

443
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,358
Come on, do something!

444
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,358
- Yeah, grandiloquent.
- Well, the same to us out of here!

445
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,358
Yes, I like Mich said, between the eyes
shot. They glowed in the dark.

446
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,700
What a wild boar? That's
what we smoked in the cabin!

447
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:44,384
Shooter damn! Have you
done something, eh?

448
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,358
Yes, we thought the boar is.

449
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
- Eyes of the world.
- That we were smoking!

450
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,358
Well, who is on the hunt smokes? Well?

451
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,360
- Well, quickly remove!
- Hey, what are you doing there?

452
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,359
We rested! Remove us of here
faster!

453
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,359
Yes, actually, and what
are you doing there?

454
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,358
What's that - a fall migration.

455
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,320
Hunters damn! Now I know,
What is your hunting!

456
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,358
You do not worry there are forces beware!

457
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,358
What shall we do, Mikhail?

458
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,360
- Come on, take it right! Right!
- Good for you, fit!

459
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,358
Come on! Forward!

460
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,358
Go to the place!

461
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,360
- You're not gauzy not gauzy!
- Yes, I'm kicking twist!

462
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,358
More, more, Mikhail, yet!

463
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,358
More more!

464
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Brakes!

465
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,358
Stop!

466
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,358
- Le, I am now!
- Come on!

467
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,860
Quickly would be cold!
The whole body numb!

468
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,278
Thirteenth cordon. Mich.
The police come.

469
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,559
Sergeant Semen ova!

470
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,360
Well, do the something!
Faster remove!

471
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,359
- Good!
- We are here as sprats in the bank!

472
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,839
All you got! Now
We will free you!

473
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,340
Quickly would be cold!
The whole body numb!

474
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,860
We're suffocating from the stench!
Break you this car!

475
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,333
Lea, you still more careful
with a jeep!

476
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,319
This machine as a native!

477
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,360
And it may be, you can still fix it?
What do you think Lou?

478
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,359
You can, if only for a convertible.

479
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,358
O Lord, and it is your hunting, eh?

480
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Well all Mikhail, phoned
to Norsemen.

481
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,359
Who will come to the special
rescuers.

482
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,359
Brazen, dirty, smelly creature!
I mean the wild boars, Comrade General!

483
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,358
Shoot them right!
Bastards - one word!

484
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Well, let's be consistent,
Olga V..

485
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,359
They are intelligent animals.
They need to take care.

486
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,359
You yourself have in this convincing.

487
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,860
I admit my mistake.

488
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,358
Stop!

489
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,358
- Wow!
- Good morning, Alexis!

490
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,358
- Health, Norsemen!
- That's the best specialist, lifeguard.

491
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,693
Well, then who needs help?

492
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:21,360
Just quickly, and then I
ripped straight from the wedding.

493
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,359
Yes, that's stuck, you know.

494
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,358
But what stuck there?

495
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,360
- Slow down!
- Careful, we're almost deaf!

496
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,859
Oh, the signs of life are served!

497
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,358
- How many are there?
- Two.

498
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,358
We'll get. I'm in the last year 7 people
of "Zaporozhye" learned.

499
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,860
Gypsies. At some holiday
back, well, in a ravine and rolled.

500
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:50,359
You will not believe the car was like ...
Well, no more drums of diesel fuel.

501
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,359
- Where is their head?
- Who?

502
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,358
Well, who in the car.

503
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,340
Lenin reach.

504
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,358
- Who?
- Lenin.

505
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,358
- What is Lenin?
- In the name of Lenin, our lifeguard.

506
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
It is because of this submitted
does not love.

507
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,359
Because of his surname.

508

Hello? I am busy right now!
I'll call you later!

00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,860
When we go to the deer?

00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,860
So, let's start?

538
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,860
Maybe males are gone?

539
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,860
Come on, give me.

Exit male. What does he want ?!

Or maybe this is not the
call of the females,

546
00:45:33,342 --> 00:45:35,358
and more on the contrary
- the cry of the male?

547
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,360
Well, we call the male to a fight, and they
fear and go.

548
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,860
We are not gone! Come again!

The glass had my contact lenses.

564
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,358
You do not need help?

00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,666
Don be upset. They had
dissolve rapidly in the stomach.

566
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,319
Nothing special.

567
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,860
Sit down.

568
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,860
- Wait, wait.

Brazen as a responsive, well!

Very correct my horn,
if it responds to the animal itself.

Now we will lay. Come on!

573

578
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,358
Something bothered me to hunt.

Oh, I was captain of the beast.
All that shouting, demanded.

- Out of left.

00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,360
In the neighboring district forester
working. They say that was the normal guy.

590
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,359
No, my not so. Its so easy
not processed.

That's where you're wrong.

596
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,360
Well, for real women, and they,

00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,860
Well, for women!

599
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,472
Throughout the year, or
even more, I spent H

600
00:50:10,496 --> 00:50:13,359
Thou among the inhabitants
of the snowy country.

601
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:19,359
But he could not comprehend the meaning of and
their skill in catching birds and animals.

602
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,358
He learned about the most revered hunter

603
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,358
and I came to him with a desire
learn skills,

604
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,860
grasp all the nuances and peculiarities
hunting locals.

605

I want to be your disciple.

606
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,358

to reach your level? "-
Thou said H skillful hunter.

608
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,358
At least seven years,
no more than eight.

609
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,358
So long? Is there no more
shortcut?

610
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:56,358
Yes, but you will know only the outer
by scientists, but not its essence.

611
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Even if you meditate in the yard

612
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,359
day and night in a pose of "cherry
on the snow-covered stone "

613
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,358
then it can take 6 years.

614
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,358
By itself, the meditation will not make
You master

615
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,840
but may return the tranquility
mind and body,

616
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,319
that is so necessary to any hunter.

617
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,860
Yes.

618
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,358
Yataro, where are you?

619
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,358
Dimes! Oleg!

620
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:11,360
Hey, Yataro! Get up,
you have weak lungs.

621
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,358
- What, it's time to hunt?
- No hunting!

622
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,320
Stop your hunts us.
Anything, but not hunting.

623
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,358
Here!

624
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:36,320
There is good depth. Even carp can
take. Or someone else.

625
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,360
Mich! And who is sitting there,
on the tree?

626
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,358
- Where?
- Lupercalia.

627
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Oh, and the next one. And there still.
And we do not have guns!

628
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,359
He said the same: at least one gun
should always have with you.

629
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,358
Yes, they still can not take!

630
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,360
They are specifically from the top of the
sitting, to get close to them is not.

631
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,358
Unless the approach?

632
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,358
Approaching ?!

633
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,358
Norsemen!

634
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,860
Something I'm tired of fishing.
Come along with me as well.

635
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,360
Lou! Here I am found!

636
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,358
Wow! Will.

637
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,860
Lou! Are you quite sure?
The point is risky!

638
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,360
This method is still in the hunt benefits
Training will!

639
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,359
And it can, and will enter the annals.

640
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,358
- In memory.
- Come on.

641
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,358
For stories!

642
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,860
Wait, not so! Come on!

643
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,344
Norsemen, and I dreamed of since childhood

644
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:09,319
conquer the air element.
Finally!

645
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,860
Well, good luck!

646
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,860
Go!

647
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,360
Do not get them? How!

648
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,359
From Hitchhike’s
no one has ever left!

649
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,359
On every trick is a natural
savvy!

650
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,358
You're like, Le?

651
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,860
Oh, good picks!

652
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,358
More slack!

653
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,358
Yet? Stradivarius!

654
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,358
I say, the grass, but be careful!

655
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,358
Le, are you okay?

656
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,358
Lou is there?

657
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:57,360
We were born to make a fairy tale to ...
Norsemen!

658
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,358
- You Measure out?
- What?

659
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,358
How many meters measured?

660
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,340
30 meters, you understand?
30 meters counted?

661
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:09,358
Lou, speak louder!
I can not hear you!

662
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,840
I say 30 meters, no more!

663
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,340
- Got it?
- What? I do not understand!

664
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,860
- Norsemen!
- What?

665
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,609
You got me ... you above!

666
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,358
Above lift? I got it!

667
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,360
What's more podiatrist?
I can not hear!

668
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,359
- Above raised!
- Le, I'm letting go!

669
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,860
Idiot! I'll let you go!

670
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:42,360
I say, down, down to descend, you idiot!
You are welcome!

671
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,340
Hey, help me! O Lord,
what it is?

672
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,319
Higher? Lou, how is it? Handsomely?

673
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,860
- Help!

674
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,860
What do you mean ?! Let go!

675
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:09,360
Lou! Lou! For trees cling!

676
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,860
Do you hear?

677
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,860
Dimes, you bite, Oleg?

678
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,358
- A?
- Do you bite?

He told about the discovery the teacher.

818
