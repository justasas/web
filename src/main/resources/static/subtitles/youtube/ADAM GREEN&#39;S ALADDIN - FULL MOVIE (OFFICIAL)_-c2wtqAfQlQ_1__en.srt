1
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:06,038
(calm music)

2
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:17,711
♫ Ain't I fair ain't I kind

3
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:20,975
♫ And I'm paid to feel fine

4
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,339
♫ But I haven't spent a dime

5
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,591
♫ Since I met you

6
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:31,103
♫ Your breasts are like two wrists

7
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:34,332
♫ That I've handcuffed to my dick

8
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:39,280
♫ In a subculture of love and refraction

9
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:45,016
♫ But I die every morning again

10
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,918
♫ Me at my worst is fun for them

11
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:51,149
♫ And I die with the feeding tube

12
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,832
♫ While you try to fix my blues

13
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:57,291
♫ Your city is so unclean

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,437
♫ In a Washington machine

15
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:05,438
♫ And your face is like
a cage and two of them

16
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:10,343
♫ And your sentiment is gone

17
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:13,737
♫ And you're now enslaved by gods

18
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:18,737
♫ While I strum my
broken legs like a banjo

19
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:24,253
♫ But I die every morning again

20
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:27,405
♫ Me at my worst is fun for them

21
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:30,640
♫ And I die with the feeding tube

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,757
♫ While you try to fix my blues ♫

23
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:35,473
- "Phoning in the Blues,"

24
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:38,267
Zintendo Records, take 15.

25
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,496
Rolling.

26
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:41,593
♫ I'm phoning in the blues

27
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:44,259
♫ Cuz my life ain't stalling

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,692
♫ The phone just rang

29
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,348
♫ To say the blues ain't calling

30
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,472
♫ I thought that I'd always
called it like I saw it

31
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,521
♫ I've got the blues and I
know just how to call 'em

32
00:01:56,522 --> 00:02:01,522
♫ Baby that's how they call the blues

33
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,974
♫ I'm phoning in the blues ♫

34
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,021
Wait cut, cut.

35
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,591
Aladdin, are you okay?

36
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:11,427
- I honestly feel that
I'm deaf to my own soul.

37
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:14,180
- You remind me of somebody
who's about to get fired.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,371
- I'm just trying to pinpoint the moment

39
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,966
that I lost my mojo.

40
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,861
- That's when you started getting drunk?

41
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:22,335
- I get drunk so that I
can continue my research.

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,386
- You told me that you spent
30,000 spacebux on cocaine.

43
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,540
- I only take cocaine to go to Brooklyn,

44
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,984
besides it helps me phone in the blues.

45
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,445
- Zintendo has been a
company since medieval times,

46
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,544
always on the forefront of innovation.

47
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,377
We invented flesh cubes, flesh digits,

48
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:39,225
faggot rock, houseface.

49
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,062
In your case, we are
not going to continually

50
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:43,520
press the same button
expecting a different result.

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,186
- Okay, Ms. President, so will I be judged

52
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:48,971
and discarded at the
hands of a corporation?

53
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,045
- Have a seat.

54
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,185
I passed a diner on my
way into Regular Town

55
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:58,894
that serves shit sandwiches,
so I got you one.

56
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:02,272
I hope you enjoy it.

57
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:03,808
- You're delivering me a shit sandwich

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,421
and you hope that I enjoy it?

59
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:07,263
- [Both] Uh-huh.

60
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,275
- But Farmer Dave, you made
me change my name to Aladdin

61
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,051
for my ninth album.

62
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,007
- C'mon, let's try
another take of the song.

63
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,741
♫ People say I'm the nature of the clown

64
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,841
♫ They say can't hold anything down

65
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:26,473
♫ If it's true will you
help me cheat on you

66
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:30,843
♫ If it's true will you
help me cheat on you

67
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:41,482
♫ What I know on your secrecy depends

68
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:44,631
♫ Treating every girl as my girlfriend

69
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:49,229
♫ When I do is it healthy being through

70
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,405
♫ If we do will you help me cheat on you

71
00:03:56,001 --> 00:04:00,825
♫ Because my hope Is a vision unruly

72
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,897
♫ And people say I'm the
nature of the clown but

73
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,669
♫ I'm not gonna kiss you
I'm not gonna kiss you

74
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:14,492
♫ I'm not gonna kiss you
I'm not gonna kiss you

75
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,411
♫ Unless you want me to

76
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,906
♫ So you want me to woo hoo ♫

77
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,442
- [Princess Barbara] No, I'm not!

78
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,608
- You will get married to a Prince!

79
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:32,742
- Stop trying to bully me

80
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:34,865
when you have no idea what's in my heart!

81
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,247
- Even if it is just symbolic,

82
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,091
it must happen.

83
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:42,319
- Great Sultan, with all due respect,

84
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,533
perhaps we just need to
get her the right drugs,

85
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,733
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:48,956
We are developing things all the time.

87
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:58,588
This is one of the protesters we arrested,

88
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:01,904
he's from a rebel group
called Magical America.

89
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,538
- What is he charged with?

90
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:05,122
- We have Internet evidence

91
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:08,557
that he pursued being gay and failed.

92
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,691
- I wish that I was bisexual.

93
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,051
- There is a prison
inside all of us, yeah.

94
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:17,208
- Hey Dad, do you think
that I'm a criminal too?

95
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,073
- Princess Barbara!

96
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:23,237
It is the law that if you
are not married in a month,

97
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:26,117
I have to execute you.

98
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,716
- So that we can film the second season

99
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:29,922
of your 'Virtual Reality Show?'

100
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:33,304
Love is not a savage form
of publicity, besides,

101
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,363
I like to fuck average people.

102
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,036
- We are fighting the war on privacy,

103
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:42,544
the Virtual Reality Show
is the next frontier.

104
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:46,573
- Normally I advocate Internet removal

105
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:47,964
for this type of thing.

106
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:51,151
However in this special case...

107
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,348
- What is so special about this case?

108
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:55,404
- Well, Your Majesty,

109
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:57,993
he didn't have to act
like he had a big dick.

110
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:06,848
- Thou shalt not advertise falsely.

111
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,441
- I didn't have to act
like I had a big dick.

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,299
- Goodbye, Mister.

113
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,160
(screaming)

114
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,124
- It just bores me to chairs.

115
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:22,288
- I like everything,
some things I like a lot,

116
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:24,281
and other things I just like.

117
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:27,161
- King of kings, in
accordance with your wishes,

118
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:31,062
all exposed people will now be developed!

119
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:34,793
- So long, guys.

120
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,846
- [Emily] Hey, Laddy, hey!

121
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:42,216
Long story short, your father's dead,

122
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:44,156
and I told you so.

123
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:49,473
They emailed me from Africa.

124
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:50,752
- To announce the death of the monster

125
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,372
who forgot about us?

126
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:55,798
- He/She didn't forget about us,

127
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:59,891
they sent a check every week
since the two of you were born,

128
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,826
though I guess now that's going to stop.

129
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,891
Could you hold my cigarette for me?

130
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,812
- Hey, how was your film class?

131
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,182
- Hmm, it was awesome!

132
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,576
I'm gonna make a movie about our family.

133
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,601
- Is that what you think
is cool now, Emily?

134
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,114
Making movies?

135
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:20,112
- If you play my mom
real good in the movie,

136
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:22,173
I'll let you be my mom in real life.

137
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,781
(laughs)

138
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,391
Why are you smiling?

139
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,999
You're still ugly.

140
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,817
- Hey, Laddy, check out this camera I got!

141
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:47,310
- Is your goal to wear me
out and make me sentimental?

142
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,593
- I want to make a profound documentary.

143
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,911
The entire working world

144
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:52,750
is either on probation or unemployed,

145
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,521
so there's never been a
better time to make artwork!

146
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,600
I want this movie to be a cry for peace.

147
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,106
- This is a mining town.

148
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:06,314
These mountains are filled
with baseball diamonds.

149
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,446
Your father, before he was a woman,

150
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:13,798
was a miner just like
everybody else in Regular Town.

151
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:18,790
Well then, that Sultan
came in from Hollywood.

152
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,860
Who put him in charge?

153
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,887
Yeah, I heard his father was a stunt-kid.

154
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,326
- The Sultan is God's grandson,

155
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,694
he is, according to e-history,
the grandson of a god.

156
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,052
- C'mon, Laddy, let's go for a walk

157
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:35,163
and check out the protests.

158
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,539
- No!
- C'mon!

159
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,117
(calm guitar music)

160
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,659
- The protestors have been camping

161
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,742
outside the Sultan's castle for weeks,

162
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,410
they call themselves
the Magical Americans.

163
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,423
They're an actual rebel
army that does crazy stuff

164
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:51,228
that's gonna change the world.

165
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:51,997
Hey!

166
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,365
- Hey!

167
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,558
- Wouldn't it be amazing
if we joined them?

168
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,916
- I only want to be bad
enough to get spanked.

169
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,898
- Can I knick a fag mate, a ciggie?

170
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:03,682
- You know, we're not walking
down the street for you.

171
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:05,159
- Where am I supposed to buy cigarettes

172
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,296
on an 8-Bit pixilated street, yeah?

173
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:13,642
Hey, not that it matters,
but I used to be a big fan.

174
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,143
You still making music?

175
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,386
- Oh god!

176
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,086
- Let's go!

177
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:21,677

179
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,521
- Cheers, One, Two!

180
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,272
- [Crowd] Cheers, One, Two!

181
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:28,869
- Who out there is perverted by nerves?

182
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,680
- [Crowd] Who out there
is perverted by nerves!

183
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,384
- Don't believe the hype that you're dead.

184
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,152
No gods allowed!

185
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:37,264
- [Crowd] No gods allowed!

186
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,870
- Maybe I'm a robot because
I definitely feel dead.

187
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,466
- I think he's amazing.

188
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:44,399
It's better than being
a sitting duck at home.

189
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,615
- But you are not dead yet,
you gray, huddled masses,

190
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:52,935
stuck in this bureaucratic
hell of secret government

191
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,118
and bad money,

192
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:57,632
all while your shadow
is trying to eat you.

193
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,096
But if you aren't gray
enough, or eaten enough,

194
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:06,235
or in debt enough, then
he's gonna lock you up

195
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,967
for a few years in the Labyrinth of Lies.

196
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:12,509
We're all his pets!

197
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,216
- [Crowd] No Gods Allowed!

198
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,110
- No Gods Allowed!

199
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,697
- [Crowd] No Gods Allowed!

200
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,203
- Shit, CIA!

201
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,019
- You're all under arrest!

202
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,195
(ominous music)

203
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,581
- Oh fuck!

204
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,520
- Follow me, quick!

205
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,953
- Okay!

206
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,743
- We have to correct the world's posture.

207
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,677
The world was meant to be beautiful!

208
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:39,055
- I've just arrived from Africa,

209
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,287
and I'm glad I found you when I did.

210
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,609
I'm your Uncle Gary!

211
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:47,232
- Uncle Gary?

212
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,430
Mom never told us we had an uncle.

213
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:52,245
- I've always wondered if
Dad even knew I existed.

214
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:55,533
- Oh, he was very impressed by you...

215
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,658
no example.

216
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:58,346
Anyway, we spent years together

217
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,970
on the coffee house
scene being entertainers.

218
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,127
- What happened, you guys
just never hit it big?

219
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:04,315
- Oh, to me, pleasure's always been

220
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,248
the finest form of entertainment.

221
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,430
I convinced him to leave
all the mining and seek fun.

222
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,346
- So at what point did Dad
decide to become a lady?

223
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:19,611
- It was at the end of me,
and the beginning of us.

224
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,346
- Huh?

225
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:23,894
- Let's go find your mother.

226
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,250
- Hi Mom, this is Uncle Gary from Africa.

227
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,221
He's here because Dad sent him.

228
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,948
- Well, Gary, thanks for coming by,

229
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,375
but it's a little much because
I barely knew their father,

230
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,001
although he gave me twins
and a few hangovers.

231
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:49,871
- Ah, but you would like
some golden spacebux though.

232
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,038
Hmm?

233
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:56,096
As I said before, I'm just here to help,

234
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,855
and you'll find that
I always keep my word.

235
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,665
- How did you know I collected gold?

236
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:06,411
- Gary, you are terrific
because I was just saying

237
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,477
it's time for us to meet a rich person!

238
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,591
- That ought to cover your
rent for a little while,

239
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:13,163
and look, my instinct is to protect you.

240
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:17,326
I am the protector of women from men.

241
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:22,298
And now, I'd like to
prepare you a frittata.

242
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,422
- A frittata!

243
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:27,457
- We're fools, I'm from a family of fools.

244
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,716
- See, guys, all that nothingness

245
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:33,086
we've been doing is
finally having some effect.

246
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,302
- Y'know, Aladdin,

247
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:37,605
- your father wanted me to
impart some wisdom upon you,

248
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:40,379
just general life lessons, you know.

249
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,783
Tomorrow morning, I wanna take you

250
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:44,523
on a hike in the
mountains, what do ya say?

251
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:47,148
- Hey, Laddy, I don't trust Uncle Gary.

252
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,178
Hang out with me tomorrow, will ya?

253
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,365
- Well, I see you're
used to having your life

254
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:52,094
run by some little chick.

255
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,136
- No, I wear the pants,
but they're her pants.

256
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:59,096
(calm music)

257
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,876
- Your father was never late,

258
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,462
but he did also not
believe in being early.

259
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,413
Being early for something is
an aggressive act in itself.

260
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:19,828
- I deny the date entirely.

261
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:21,326
What's the difference,

262
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:22,533
I'm an upper middle class pauper

263
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,777
about to get dropped
from Zintendo Records,

264
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:26,221
I don't even subscribe to romance

265
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,258
outside the family tradition.

266
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,473
- Oh, wouldn't it be great

267
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:32,796
if we had an emotional
stuntman for our hearts?

268
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:35,158
- What's up here, the Ten Commandments?

269
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,669
- Right now, we're in
the high part of hell,

270
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:40,211
up there is the lowest part of heaven.

271
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,062
There's a mine up here
your father used to work in

272
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,564
I'd like to show you.

273
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:51,319
- Ciao.

274
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:52,504
- Ciao.

275
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,014
- Uncle Gary, what's that?

276
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:00,180
Are we not supposed to be here?

277
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,798
- Yeah, this place is also
a graveyard for aliens,

278
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,856
the Lumambrians.

279
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:06,698
- [Aladdin] The Lumambrians.

280
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:09,126
Are aliens natural?

281
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:11,901
- Sure, all technology is natural.

282
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,221
Look...

283
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:16,673
God equals Humans

284
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:21,025
divided by Nature plus Aliens.

285
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,581

288
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,474

00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:54,495
♫ I don't believe that

290
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:59,038
♫ I just believe each man is a lost king

291
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:05,464
♫ And I'm feeling sorry
for someone else's plan ♫

292
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,850
- Hey, look, it's the old mineshaft

293
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,173
Do you have the key?

294
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:21,073
- It'll be dark soon.

295
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,161
Gather some wood, I'll build a fire.

296
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,600
As I said, this is a very special place.

297
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,989
Miners discovered things
here, magical things.

298
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,141
Underneath this ground

299
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,485
is the stuff that makes up everything,

300
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,901
you know, the real star stuff!

301
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,511
Something I learned back in the days

302
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,615
when I was talking real fast in Cairo.

303
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:50,037
We start by globing the circle,

304
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,911
then cubing the globe,

305
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,076
and finally triangulating the cubic globe.

306
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:59,163
My, my! Ramaho! Niya! Niya!

307
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,562
- What's it for?

308
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,033
- It's the cave computer,

309
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,730
it's a sacred intelligence
that begins and does not begin

310
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,954
with everlasting and
never-lasting colored cords.

311
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,932
In the left corner, that's you.

312
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:19,239
That's me.

313
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,500
And at the bottom,
that's what's down there.

314
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,511
- I've never seen anything like it,

315
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,874
how are you supposed to hold it?

316
00:16:28,874 --> 00:16:31,274
- You've got to go down there and get it!

317
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,149
Go to the entrance of
the mineshaft and say,

318
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,443
My, my! Ramaho! Niya! Niya!

319
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:43,639
- My, my! Ramaho! Niya! Niya!

320
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,471
- Each man is a lost king.

321
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,108
Inside this cave is a treasure

322
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,860
that will make us richer
than a fugger, it's true!

323
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,335
Through that entrance

324
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:57,619
is the wreckage of an alien spacecraft.

325
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,757
Down the stairs, there are three rooms.

326
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:02,091
Walk straight through them
and you will come to a garden

327
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,824
with beautiful trees and many treasures.

328
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,892
Cross the garden path
and walk up many steps

329
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:15,892
to where a lamp is displayed
on a fiery pedestal.

330
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:20,517
This is not an ordinary lamp.

331
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,790
Take the lamp and bring it to me.

332
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,774
- Why don't you do it?

333
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,025
- No, I can't.

334
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,567
This is your door.

335
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,630
Believe me when I say this
door was made only for you.

336
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,109
(calm music)

337
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:39,916

353
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:01,436
What is the most beautiful
language in this world?

354
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,826
- The most beautiful
language in this world

355
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:07,077
is sign language.

356
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,936
- The lamp is yours.

357
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,329
- The CIA!

358
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:21,841
Aladdin!

359
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:25,578
Aladdin!

360
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:30,040
Aladdin!

361
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:37,237
Aladdin, quick throw up the lamp!

362
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,810
- Uncle Gary, give me
your hand and help me up.

363
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:39,880
- [Uncle Gary] I will, of course.

364
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:40,993
Just throw up the lamp first

365
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,512
so it doesn't get in your way.

366
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:46,604
I'm afraid we're out of time.

367
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,968
- [Aladdin] What the hell! Come back!

368
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:05,021
(grunting)

369
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:14,124
Lord, please forgive my transgressions.

370
00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:19,008
(enchanting music)

371
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,002
What?

372
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:41,959
- You have a lot of nerve
to drive me out of the lamp.

373
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,970
- It's true, I have a lot of gumption.

374
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,514
- What are you?

375
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:51,240
- I'm Mustafa, the interface of the lamp.

376
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,984
I'm the future as the present.

377
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:58,629
- Mustafa, can you save me?

378
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,962
- I can save you from your corporate fate

379
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,539
if we work together.

380
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,086
- I don't want to get involved
in any monkey business.

381
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:09,775
- The lamp is a printer,

382
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:14,694
I can print you anything
that you wish for,

383
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:18,624
but understand, unlike a gift,

384
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:22,693
a wish has more in common with a hole.

385
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:24,024
- I couldn't seem to imagine the depths

386
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:25,899
at which I wouldn't want a wish.

387
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:29,515
- Just let go of what you don't have.

388
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,014
- That's personal.

389
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,216
- Just let go of it.

390
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,729
- Okay, yeah.

391
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:38,183
Print me out a ladder
and a key to that door.

392
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:41,990
(scratching sound)

393
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:54,708
- I've heard that you reject every prince,

394
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,845
no matter what, but I was curious

395
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:58,517
if your confidence masked
a greater insecurity.

396
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,372
- No, I'm about as arrogant as I look.

397
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:05,306
- You look as if you are
going to hate growing old.

398
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:07,144
- You waste of flesh, go home,

399
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:08,361
you can't win me

400
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,027
because you are not worth
being made a fool over.

401
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,119
It's as simple as that.

402
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,850
Delete your face.

403
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:19,149
- Time is running out, Princess,

404
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:21,205
and you know what you haven't done.

405
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,884
- Mom, I'm not sure if Uncle
Gary's really our uncle,

406
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:36,411
and also on that walk we
took, he tried to kill me!

407
00:22:36,411 --> 00:22:39,366
- Oh Aladdin, don't be so hard on him.

408
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,404
Uncle Gary is a complicated man,

409
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:43,561
but he's been very generous with us.

410
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:45,094
- But he was still trying to sacrifice me

411
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:47,221
on top of a mountain for a god.

412
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:50,070
- But he made me a great frittata.

413
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,915
- Look, check this out!

414
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:56,202
- Who's that?

415
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:58,648
- I'm the guy who knows what time it is.

416
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:03,148
- Mustafa, print us a luxury living room.

417
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,794
- Okee-dokee.

418
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:08,262
(scratching noise)

419
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:15,189
(squeals)

420
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,324
- Print us 10 million spacebux!

421
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,788
Wow, this is a lot, maybe too much stuff.

422
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:46,576
You know, some people
like to go on the road,

423
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:50,574
but I'm the progenitor of
the "Stay at Home" movement.

424
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,931
- Aladdin, you really are
the world's greatest son.

425
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:55,818
Mwah!

426
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,797
- Everything's a number these days.

427
00:23:57,797 --> 00:24:02,005
(calm music)

428
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,397
- Well, the bad news is that
Magical America is bankrupt,

429
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,127
we are completely broke.

430
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,512
- Give us some good news, Ralph.

431
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:31,092
- Well, 15-Year-Old, the good news is that

432
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:33,566
ultimately we're all
working for the Internet.

433
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:35,073
Preventing the Sultan and the CIA

434
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,783
from seizing control of e-history

435
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:39,987
is one way to subvert the doom spiral,

436
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,489
yet we have no resources.

437
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,030
- I'll do whatever I need
to do to aid in that.

438
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:50,155
Hi, I'm Emily, I'm a fan.

439
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:53,984
- Hi, I'm 15-Year-Old.

440
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:56,522
- So, what does your graffiti stand for?

441
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:58,734
- Oh, it's Graffiti Stands For.

442
00:25:00,726 --> 00:25:03,420
- I'd like to make a Fahrenheit
9/11-style documentary

443
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,208
about all the shit that's
going down in Regular Town.

444
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,150
- We believe 9/11 was an accident.

445
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,473
- In general, our stance
on creative endeavors

446
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,057
is that everyone's amazing,

447
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,725
so we have a strict no-masterpiece policy.

448
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,621
- Huh.

449
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:17,816
I can deal with that.

450
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,209
So, what's your stance on monogamy?

451
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:23,615
- Great Sultan, we prepared
the technology report.

452
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:25,636
- Terrific!

453
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:28,138
First question, can you fuck it?

454
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:31,222
- We discovered a particle
that responds to prayer.

455
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:34,645
- Why are people always
trying to fix something

456
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:36,615
when there's nothing wrong?

457
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:41,056
Yes, yes, pray to Grandpa God.

458
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:44,173
- Also down at the lab,
we've invented a robot.

459
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,110
It's a walking briefcase.

460
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:51,111
We call it the Storage Eunuch.

461
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:55,161
Your daughter seems to
be quite fond of it.

462
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,538
- Bravo, bravo Gennaro Russo!

463
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,373
The promised age of leisure has arrived.

464
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,603
These robots, they will
do all the work for us.

465
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:11,248
You know, I think I might still be it

466
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:13,276
from my last game of tag.

467
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,132
(phone ringing)

468
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:23,410
- [Aladdin] Hi, this is
Aladdin, I'm not here right now.

469
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,194
Please don't leave a message, send a text.

470
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:27,970
(long beep tone)

471
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,345
(phone ringing)

472
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:35,052
- Aladdin, you decadent
fool, pick up the phone.

473
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,879
(calm music)

474
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:50,203
- Ah, Princess Barbara, may
I speak with you a moment,

475
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:53,099
do you have a meeting with the drama club?

476
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,338
- I'm going to the Chinese Dance.

477
00:26:56,337 --> 00:27:00,578
- Oh no, it's just, do you know who I am?

478
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,508
- You're the head of the CIA.

479
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:04,063
- I'm far more than just an enabler

480
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:05,713
of your father's technophilia.

481
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:07,118
After a few drinks, I assure you

482
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:10,016
my face can become quite average.

483
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:13,506
- Gennaro Russo, what did I
tell you about being cool?

484
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,032
- What I'm trying to say is

485
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:19,564
there may be an opposite
world where pain is good.

486
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:22,590
- I left my keys in the Storage Eunuch,

487
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:26,040
and I'm off.

488
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,999
- Please allow me to
accompany you, Barbara.

489
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:33,943
(funky music)

490
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:52,459
- Hey!

491
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,125
- Aye!

492
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,207
- You partying tonight?

493
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:57,294
- Aww, yeah, mate, what
are we getting into?

494
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,329
- I was thinking about
giving myself a little taste.

495
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:03,322
- Sure, mate, I've always
justified it in the past meself.

496
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,868
I got some clean needles in me roadcase,

497
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:11,867
or maybe a bindle of beak perhaps.

498
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:14,122
- Gimme a bindle of beak,

499
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:15,527
you know, I'm going to the Chinese Dance.

500
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,827
- Nice one.

501
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,900
(engine revving)

502
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:21,180
- Whoa!

503
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:24,231
- Ciao, Paesanos.

504
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,627
- Princess Barbara, mate,
she's a well fit bird.

505
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,273
♫ Feel my love

506
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:36,383
♫ Coming from the heavens above ♫

507
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:38,519
- Fuck me, guy.

508
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,567
♫ When my eyes meet your eyes

509
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:45,054
(calm music)

510
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:52,957
♫ Baby come dance with me

511
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,546
- Try and drink this!

512
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:03,209
♫ I'm TV at the TV station

513
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:09,319
♫ Baby come dance with me

514
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,293
♫ Baby come dance with me

515
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:19,057
♫ I'm TV at the TV station

516
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:29,217
- Will you go on a date with me?

517
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:31,099
Yes, maybe, of course?

518
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,855
Of course.

519
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,564
A fountain pen is a serious aphrodisiac.

520
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,472
- I also have a headphone splitter.

521
00:29:40,472 --> 00:29:43,818
- Your shirt looks like it has a big cock.

522
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:45,289
- Well, I'm hiding a genie in there,

523
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,644
so when's our date?

524
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:49,430
- Honestly, it's not going to happen,

525
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,349
my father will only let me
go on a date with a prince.

526
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,926
- Great Sultan, there's
a woman here to see you.

527
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:04,339
- A woman, I'm jealous
of every woman I see.

528
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,630
Does she have poise?

529
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:09,508
- Is having poise the girl
equivalent of being cool?

530
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,443
If so, she does not.

531
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:13,923
- Very well, let her in.

532
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:25,900
- Your Majesty, I'm a messenger

533
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:28,192
from a wealthy prince from a far away land

534
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:31,752
who wishes to ask your daughter on a date.

535
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:36,321
Additionally he has all the
cool things that assholes own,

536
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:40,569
I beg you please do not
delay his dream fulfillment.

537
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,533
Oh, also he asked me to deliver a note

538
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:45,281
to the Princess Barbara.

539
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:52,391
- Oh father,

540
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:55,667
maybe I would like to go
on a date with this prince.

541
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,286
I've been thinking about it

542
00:30:57,287 --> 00:31:00,495
and I may have been leading
an inappropriate life.

543
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:02,273
- You tell your prince

544
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:07,273
he can have his date as
soon as he brings 36 slaves,

545
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:11,778
handsome, well built,

546
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:16,778
and 36 laptop computers made of gold.

547
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,502
Golden computers...

548
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:25,039
- Your majesty, I think
perhaps this suitor...

549
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,895
- What's the prince's name?

550
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:31,197
- He goes by Prince Average Cabbage.

551
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,675
♫ And I say uno dos

552
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:36,739
♫ Uno dos tres

553
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,384
- Cheers.

554
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,311
- Cheers.

555
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,031
(relaxing music)

556
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:57,987
♫ Bingo birthday bimbo bambo

557
00:31:57,988 --> 00:32:01,891
♫ This is Aladdin's birthday mambo

558
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:06,151
♫ Jingo Django light the candles

559
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:10,278
♫ Aladdin's birthday mambo ♫

560
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:15,086
This hotel room comes with a
complimentary Swedish roommate.

561
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:18,395
Will my butler please give
her a bump of Pinocchio?

562
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,600
- Yeah, that's the good stuff, mate.

563
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:26,041
- We're going on a drunken spree!

564
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,173
I feel as dumb as a cool guy.

565
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:33,604
Let me just print out a condom.

566
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:38,866
Keep playing!

567
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:40,199
Keep playing!

568
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:43,842
- Hey Aladdin, so what
were you saying before

569
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,908
about vaginal theory?

570
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:48,331
- Ah, vaginal theory, here goes.

571
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:52,094
A pussy is a vagina that
comes pre-moistened,

572
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:55,788
and as it dries out,
turns into a vagina again.

573
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:57,836
- I'm watching that
pussy turn into a vagina

574
00:32:57,836 --> 00:33:01,067
right before my very eyes, mate.

575
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,279
- A twat is something a 3-year-old has,

576
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,307
- and a cunt is a man's mouth
where a vagina should be.

577
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:10,429
- You stupid cunts, cunts all of ya',

578
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:12,865
ha-ha, right, mate?

579
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:16,569
- Well, technically,
that's just your perception

580
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:18,127
of the pieces.

581
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:20,474
(moaning)

582
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,173
(victory music)

583
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:37,528
- It's hard to keep me hungry.

584
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:41,699
Hey, let's drink another song
and listen to another beer.

585
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:45,147
Hey, fellas, can I make a request?

586
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:48,281
Do you guys know how to
play "Interested in Music?"

587
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:51,093
- We play an excellent 11-minute version.

588
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,616
Two three four.

589
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:57,545
(calm music)

590
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:04,234
♫ Are you interested in music

591
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:06,973
♫ You like to walk in town ♫

592
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:09,532
- Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

593
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:13,855
a royal prince, Average Cabbage!

594
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:18,208
(cheering)

595
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:21,361
- It's the next contestant on the Sultan's

596
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,155
virtual reality show!

597
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:26,713
Everything we used to call
porn is now our culture.

598
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:28,635
- The Princess is a connoisseur of trash!

599
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:31,467
- I'm just a cool cat in a small town.

600
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,724
Ms. President?

601
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:34,872
- You look really stupid up there.

602
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:37,511
- I'm not stupid, I'm just inconclusive.

603
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:38,388
- Farmer Dave.

604
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:39,583
- Call me.

605
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,166
- Welcome to Primavera Palace.

606
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:58,047
(groaning)

607
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:01,565
- He spends his whole life
sitting on that dildo.

608
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:03,947
- You remind me of somebody pretty.

609
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:07,656
- I'm clever to feel
and expensive to love.

610
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:10,092
You remind me of somebody nice.

611
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:13,251
- Come with me on a flying rug ride!

612
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,936
(calm music)

613
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:20,793
- I like it up here away
from all those cameras.

614
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:23,846
- Too many gods always blocking our view.

615
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:25,329
- Ciao, birds.

616
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:31,854
- Level after level of
heaven after heaven,

617
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:34,006
I'm your Pegasus, dollface.

618
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:38,929
- I dare you to respect
me more than I do you.

619
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:42,080
- Hmm, sexuality is imbalance,

620
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:43,583
perhaps it's nice to live in a world

621
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,373
dominated by gravity.

622
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,177
You see that traffic light?

623
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:51,586
I'm gonna get that for you.

624
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:53,265
And that bike, and that pickaxe,

625
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,800
I'm gonna get that for you too!

626
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,525
Mustafa, print us out a shit sandwich.

627
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,340
(scratching noise)

628
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,612
- Ha-ha!

629
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:08,927
- What is this, a shit sandwich?

630
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,525
Who gave this to us?

631
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:13,523
- Hey man, we don't
want your shit sandwich!

632
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:16,152
(laughing)

633
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,864
Let's print out some ecstasy.

634
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:25,332
(scratching noise)

635
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,123
- I wonder what
self-realization would mean

636
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:31,044
for a guy like me.

637
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:33,318
- It would probably be pretty ironic.

638
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,560
What does ironic mean anymore?

639
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:39,731
- Ironic is what comes after modern.

640
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,806
Everything after modern is ironic,

641
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:44,115
including all of e-history.

642
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,447
- If we had sex, would that be ironic?

643
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:54,148
(moaning)

644
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,472
- I think you're a big deal, Barbara,

645
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,942
I love you.

646
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:08,415
- You don't love me, it's
just the ecstasy talking.

647
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,941
- No, no, not true, dollface.

648
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,489
If you keep on peeling off the layers,

649
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,350
you'll just discover a guy
who wants to be with you.

650
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:15,960
I have an idea.

651
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:21,920
Mustafa, print us out a baby.

652
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,005
(scratching noise)

653
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:25,004
(baby coos)

654
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:28,420
- Cute, what shall we name him?

655
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,052
- Let's call him Gizmo.

656
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,995
Hi, Gizmo.

657
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,596
- How many of these Aladdin passports

658
00:37:34,596 --> 00:37:36,204
are we gonna make?

659
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:37,862
- Seven billion.

660
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,994
- Maybe his next album could come

661
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,247
with a free pack of cigarettes.

662
00:37:41,246 --> 00:37:44,676
- Maybe his next album could
be a pack of cigarettes.

663
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:48,000
He's just turned so massively nihilistic.

664
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,807
First with all the cocaine,
and what's he even celebrating?

665
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,208
Well, I guess an artist
is a captain at sea

666
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,509
just keeping a ledger.

667
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,376
- Artists are people who
are constantly in search

668
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,244
of the reason why people like them.

669
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,557
Only in his own world
can he feel handsome.

670
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:10,592

he's not picking up his phone.

686

I can see you've been
appreciating the Midas touch.

687

- Aladdin's at the Ferrari store.

688
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:16,130
No, no, no, actually,
he's at the Chinese Dance.

689

Y'know, Gary, I can't help,
but think about that night

Sometimes I wish that he'd
just aimed for the toilet,

693
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:35,732
then I could have really
done something with my life.

We are what's missing from this world.

00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,157
surveillance efforts
does something to subvert

706
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:40,307
their control over e-history.

707
00:40:40,306 --> 00:40:42,903
- We need transparency from
the government on down.

708
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:44,242
This entire system was built

709
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:47,019
with 18th century technology in mind.

710
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:50,197
We could create a digital liquid democracy

711
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,525
and live in an experimental
prototype community.

712
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:56,241
We could recreate what money is

713
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:59,301
and develop a money that
rots like vegetables.

714
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:03,079
But we just don't have any resources.

715
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:10,222
- My brother has something
that I think could help us.

716
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:13,134
I'm gonna go find him.

717
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:24,052
(calm music)

718
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:30,524
- Your Excellency, these
are gifts from your suitor.

719
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:45,460
- I told you I was
gonna get those for you.

720
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,532
- How did you have the time

721
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:48,750
to print those without me noticing?

722
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,927
Oh well, I guess I had
time to fuck Mustafa

723
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:53,940
while you were in the shower.

724
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,067
- What?

725
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:57,144
- I said I fucked Mustafa.

726
00:41:57,143 --> 00:41:59,173
He's very fun to fuck.

727
00:42:00,077 --> 00:42:02,099
I won't be made a fool of.

728
00:42:03,226 --> 00:42:06,385
- My disappointment is like
a third party between us.

729
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:09,478
Where's Gizmo?

730
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:10,786
Gizmo!

731
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:21,396
- It was your job to feed him, not mine.

732
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,556
He's now dead like our
love was an aborted wish.

733
00:42:23,556 --> 00:42:25,304
- You have a despicable soul.

734
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:28,300
Your personality is like a mind trick.

735
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,481
- The worst part is that
I probably do love you.

736
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:32,968
- Why don't you go fuck a genie instead?

737
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,028
- Doesn't this prove that
you don't love me forever?

738
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:37,177
- Just because I'm sensitive
doesn't mean I'm nice.

739
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:40,311
My goal was always to change
you and then discard you.

740
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,750
- Listen up here, Prince Average Cabbage.

741
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:46,019
You've been up for five days straight,

742
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,186
go home and sleep.

743
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,690
- Can you please squeeze me?

744
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,871
I just want your little ass to hold me,

745
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,588
and I need more and more.

746
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,798
- Delete your face!

747
00:42:59,862 --> 00:43:04,472
(calm music)

748
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:10,275
♫ Things are not so horrible

749
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:19,133
♫ Now you're not my Oracle

750
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:27,119
♫ Something died for all time

751
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,056
♫ When I saw you conspiring

752
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:35,684
♫ To never lift a finger ♫

753
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:37,291
- Print out a magic lamp.

754
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:41,440
(scratching noise)

755
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:04,530
♫ Once you were my manager

756
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:12,663
♫ Then you were my passenger

757
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:20,693
♫ Different highs different lies

758
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:25,693
♫ 'Til no soul would reshape you again

(phone ringing)

764
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:04,030
- Ms. President?

765
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,360
- What are you doing?

766
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,608
- I'm looking in the mirror at garbage.

767
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:08,581
- Nonsense, you're blessed

768
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,230
with an extremely pure soul, Aladdin.

769
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:12,857
- I'm surrounded by sentimental fools

770
00:45:12,856 --> 00:45:15,018
and psychic vampires.

771
00:45:15,018 --> 00:45:16,063
- Well, where do people go

772
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:18,121
when there's no such place as away?

773
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:19,939
- I'm glad you asked that question.

774
00:45:19,938 --> 00:45:21,509
In the future, bad people

775
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,432
will have to be encouraged
to kill themselves.

776
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:25,652
- Reasons should be abundant,

777
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:28,695
maybe it's time for a
visitation of judgment.

778
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:31,371
- Will you go get vodka
and caviar with me?

779
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:32,771
- Definitely.

780
00:45:37,585 --> 00:45:38,991
- Chinese Dance.

781
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:46,715
- Hey mister, read all about it,

782
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:48,021
"Average Savage."

783
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:49,641
Barbara and her new boyfriend
got into some kind of

784
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,942
digital printing accident last night.

785
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:53,822
- Let me see that.

786
00:45:53,822 --> 00:45:55,534
Aladdin!

787
00:45:55,534 --> 00:45:57,449
Franchastic!

788
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:58,854
The lamp.

789
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:02,282
It's the ultimate outsider's curse!

790
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,182
Come with me, boy.

791
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:11,153
(sucking sound)

792
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:33,933
- That was the best
blowjob I've ever heard.

793
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:36,288
- Now you can't say anything
about me doing drugs.

794
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:37,836
- I never would, Barbara.

795
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,693
(zips)

796
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:40,368
I never would.

797
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:48,050
Great Sultan, with all due respect.

798
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,201
We like everybody in some kind of debt.

799
00:46:51,202 --> 00:46:53,952
That way we get the most
amount of work out of them,

800
00:46:53,952 --> 00:46:55,790
and they are too emotionally distracted

801
00:46:55,789 --> 00:46:57,617
to rise up against us.

802
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:02,061
- I'm so hungry and fat.

803
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:03,648
- An emotional tax will be necessary

804
00:47:03,648 --> 00:47:05,541
as well as an economic one.

805
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:09,682
Firstly we can extract
psychic debt using Wi-Fi.

806
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:11,601
Now Wi-Fi is basically a video game

807
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:13,522
that simulates drowning.

808
00:47:13,523 --> 00:47:16,823
Timing is everything, time versus choice,

809
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:18,715
and it's because choices take time

810
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:21,528
that we can really drown them in Wi-Fi.

811
00:47:21,528 --> 00:47:24,150
For example, a mandatory app we developed

812
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,119
called 'Thankster.'

813
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,509
People have to thank
everybody for thanking them.

814
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:30,052
It's an endless thank loop.

815
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:32,813
They'll never have time
to leave the house again.

816
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,320
People break dozens of laws each day.

817
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,005
The only thing that stops everybody

818
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:39,315
from being in jail for life

819
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,496
is our inaccuracy in detecting
all the little laws they broke

820
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:44,635
and then prosecuting them for it.

821
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:48,298
These tiny drones, the size of a housefly,

822
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,708
hover over their heads,

823
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:52,364
monitoring everything that they do.

824
00:47:52,364 --> 00:47:53,896
We're gonna need millions of them,

825
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:55,152
and they're expensive.

826
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:56,921
For everyone's debt,

827
00:47:56,922 --> 00:48:00,115
we demand that they shower us with tech.

828
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:01,844
We're gonna need money to buy drones

829
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,701
to make debt to get tech!

830
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:08,779
- I'm the luckiest god in the whole world.

831
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:11,393
In the whole world!

832
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:13,833
Ohh!

833
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:19,743
- Awesome!

834
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,751
- Let's get together 300
of the best people we know

835
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,068
and start a community
based on our own integrity,

836
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:29,366
and the gift of the lamp that
Emily has bestowed upon us.

837
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:32,334
Mustafa, print a stack
of guns for our militia.

838
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:36,293
- (15-year-old) Nice.

839
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:39,380
- The love generation
was a failed experiment,

840
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,017
until it worked!

841
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:43,679
- Being a revolutionary

842
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,966
has always been attractive to a young man.

843
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,934
- What ever happened to
correcting the world's posture?

844
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:51,619
- I dunno, maybe it could be solved

845
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:54,216
by the simple writing of a check.

846
00:48:54,215 --> 00:48:55,552
- I completed an algorithm

847
00:48:55,552 --> 00:48:58,045
for the new digital-spacebux currency.

848
00:48:58,045 --> 00:48:59,469
- Good job, 15-Year-Old.

849
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,674
Are you guys okay with
this being all digital?

850
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:03,706
- It doesn't even matter.

851
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:05,684
This lamp is making
money with its copyright.

852
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:08,639
- Do your dreams pay
attention to copyright?

853
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,639
- If life is a dream, then
it certainly is a long one.

854
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:15,137
- For our main meeting hall,

855
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:18,438
we'll need you to print
out a geodesic dome.

856
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:22,186
(scratching noise)

857
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:26,773
- What about the rest of the planet?

858
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:29,079
- How manageable is my
neighbor's delusion?

859
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:31,605
I think we'll just have
to speak for ourselves.

860
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,224
- Prints are like martinis.

861
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:35,391
Printing one thing is
fine, two is too many,

862
00:49:35,391 --> 00:49:36,825
and three is not enough!

863
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:38,011
- Life is a gift.

864
00:49:38,012 --> 00:49:42,030
After that, we just
live the life we print.

865
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,172
- I've created a printing cult!

866
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:46,510
(sighs)

867
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,143
(calm music)

868
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:00,095
- So it didn't work out
with your girlfriend?

869
00:50:00,094 --> 00:50:01,896
- Her heart was a butcher shop.

870
00:50:03,806 --> 00:50:04,813
- Don't you mean the kind of shop

871
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:07,099
where they massage the
money out of your pants?

872
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:10,911
(calm music)

873
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:19,189
- She's always holding herself
hostage with her drugs.

874
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:22,701
She must be miserable without me.

875
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:25,699
- Can someone like that love
you without killing you?

876
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:27,666
- Her love is a guilty pleasure of mine.

877
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:31,723
I have the choice between
broken hearted or delusional.

878
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:34,193
- Well, I guess some things
don't have to be settled.

879
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:40,914
- I see no cooperation in the night sky.

880
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:43,503
The planet to me is just a stone tumor.

881
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:46,433
- Yes, we are bacteria and fungus,

882
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:49,711
but that's the least
important thing about us.

883
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:53,603
- It's encouraging that we're
getting someplace together.

884
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:59,825
- Now, we must make the world remember

885
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:01,744
where it left the lamp.

886
00:51:02,822 --> 00:51:06,252
One cup of ground up computers,

887
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:10,635
one bucket of rainwater.

888
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:14,059
- What's it to ya if
it's rainwater or not?

889
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:15,972
- Memories just a bucket of rain.

890
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,375
This will help the world unforget.

891
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:23,376
Now, My My Ramaho Niya Niya!

892
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,932
- That bubble's made out of stone, Mister.

893
00:51:27,932 --> 00:51:30,016
- It's the Cave Computer,

894
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,478
it's leading us to the lamp!

895
00:51:39,878 --> 00:51:42,264
- This world runs on worlds.

896
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:44,228
It's a cannibal universe.

897
00:51:44,228 --> 00:51:47,195
- Everybody always feeding
off of everybody's privacy.

898
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:51,501
Mustafa, print us some caviar and toast.

899
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:56,836
- We all fight for privacy
and we all lose the fight.

900
00:51:56,836 --> 00:52:00,108
The 'Virtual Reality Show,'
it's pornography of the soul,

901
00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:01,701
but then again, just a few days ago,

902
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,293
you were famous and broke.

903
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:05,743
- They were gonna throw
me in debtor's prison.

904
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:07,227
- Human life on earth is purgatory,

905
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:10,134
so don't be surprised when
purgatory doesn't stop.

906
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:13,799
- So we think that pornography
is an aspect of purgatory.

907
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,717
- And so is technology.

908
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:18,816
One day we will all be naked
again through technology.

909
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:21,004
- Sometimes it makes me wish there was a

910
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,172
technology-limiting-machine.

911
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,447
- Until we are naked and alien,

912
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:27,181
it's a purgatory.

913
00:52:29,887 --> 00:52:31,925
We gotta be quiet, my
roommates are sleeping.

914
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,249
I wanna try try using the lamp sometime.

915
00:52:38,248 --> 00:52:39,740
- You'd love it.

916
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,400
It's like mainlining your dreams.

917
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,471
I wanna use your body in a different way

918
00:52:43,472 --> 00:52:45,079
than I'm accustomed to.

919
00:52:45,956 --> 00:52:48,396
- Question: Do you feel like

920
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:50,081
you are being pulled inside the lamp?

921
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:53,033
- Yeah, every time I feel closer to you,

922
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,713
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside the lamp a little bit.

923
00:52:56,911 --> 00:53:00,611
- I'm thinking it might be
fun to go inside the lamp.

924
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:03,577
- Just because it's inside
doesn't mean it's good.

925
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:06,403
I only get with lunatics and
hot idiots, Ms. President.

926
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:08,721
I am that awful man.

927
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:11,132
- Aren't you content
just to be a naughty boy?

928
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:13,295
- Sometimes I'd just like to have sex

929
00:53:13,295 --> 00:53:14,836
and feel like it's vaguely fair.

930
00:53:14,836 --> 00:53:17,235
- I'll be sleazy just to contradict you.

931
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,112
- But this shit sandwich
keeps flying towards my face.

932
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:22,190
I don't know how to avoid it.

933
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,329
- Aladdin,

934
00:53:25,532 --> 00:53:28,123
I don't mind splitting a
shit sandwich with you.

935
00:53:40,362 --> 00:53:41,572
- It is one of the most important things

936
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:43,755
in the universe that we make love.

937
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:51,129
- [Ms. President] Don't
look back, Aladdin.

938
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,985
(moaning)

939
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:07,114
- I was jerking off the other day,

940
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:09,576
and Mustafa came out of my dick.

941
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:14,684
- Well, isn't that the saddest
sexual fantasy of all time?

942
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,009
- No, I think it happened.

943
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:20,653
Lemme put this mask on.

944
00:54:22,672 --> 00:54:24,233
- I'm not into it.

945
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:26,701
C'mon, don't you want to
be sexually - creative?

946
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:30,021
- You, Ralph Caulfield and Emily Green

947
00:54:30,021 --> 00:54:31,190
are being charged

948
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,186
with possession and
distribution of marijuana,

949
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:36,774
pirating music and films.

950
00:54:41,021 --> 00:54:45,932
Jaywalking, littering,
public intoxication,

951
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:49,262
failing to declare income,

952
00:54:49,262 --> 00:54:51,651
larceny at a salad bar,

953
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,062
public exposure, cohabitation,

954
00:54:55,063 --> 00:54:58,416
sodomy, and printing guns.

955
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,130
You're both monsters,

956
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,818
and I am sending you
straight to bureaucratic hell

957
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:05,203
in the Labyrinth of Lies.

958
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:08,043
- The law is a tax, and paying your taxes

959
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,011
is like having a subscription to jail.

960
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,158
- You're the devil!

961
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:13,529
- No, I'm the Devil's clone!

962
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,740
- No! (gasps)

963
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,876
- Let this be a wake-up alarm to you.

964
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:21,426
- I didn't realize that
my body parts were alarms.

965
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:23,757
- And I'll be confiscating this!

966
00:55:23,757 --> 00:55:24,800
- Hey, what's the big idea?

967
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,402
Give that back, Mister!

968
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:36,142
(calm piano music)

969
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:42,775
- That was the strongest orgasm
I've ever had in my life.

970
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:44,913
- Ms. President,

971
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:47,248
I always thought you were a company girl.

972
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:50,081
- And that's a bad thing,
because I have a job?

973
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:52,817
Besides, the company
I'm working for is you.

974
00:55:52,818 --> 00:55:54,018
- You're working for me?

975
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,717
- I have a bad-boy part of my personality

976
00:55:55,717 --> 00:55:58,050
which I need for my
partner to express for me.

977
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:03,114
We are now insiders of each other.

978
00:56:03,114 --> 00:56:04,782
You have a bottomless need
for every woman in the world

979
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:07,539
to love you, as every
woman in the world knows.

980
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:09,276
Yet it's you who now seek averages,

981
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:11,567
in moderation and balance.

982
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,582
- My biggest fear is
to be poorly suspended

983
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,286
on a tightrope between birth and death.

984
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:17,780
- Well, of course, you're
going to be insecure

985
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,668
if you're not tucked in correctly.

986
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:20,882
- I never thought that
I could trust myself

987
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:23,090
with someone else's heart,

988
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,770
maybe I had to be a
prince to become a genie.

989
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:27,594
Mustafa, you live here!

990
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,135
- I'm the big fat bear

991
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,867
hiding behind a tiny little tree.

992
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:38,712
- C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

993
00:56:38,713 --> 00:56:40,870
- Aww, geewhiz!

994
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,474
- So this is what mainlining
your dreams looks like.

995
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:48,510
- In here, we all look like
what's right next to us.

996
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,440
- The lamp connects to
a frequency of Wi-Fi

997
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,360
that mushrooms tap into,

998
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,792
fungus is a space-age material.

999
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:57,543
- So the lamp is basically a mushroom.

1000
00:56:57,543 --> 00:57:00,037
- Even Jesus was a
little bit of a mushroom.

1001
00:57:00,036 --> 00:57:02,009
And at Zintendo, we've been
developing digital mushrooms

1002
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:03,554
for quite some time.

1003
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:04,849
Within a hundred years,

1004
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:06,411
assuming we live in an average universe,

1005
00:57:06,411 --> 00:57:08,400
humans will be contacted by aliens

1006
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,110
and during that time, we'll
have evolved ourselves

1007
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,762
into a techno-fungal insect species.

1008
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,710
- If they are going to
start reinventing humans,

1009
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,192
they should really start at
the back and the spine area.

1010
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:20,010
- Human beings are basically insects

1011
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,013
wrapped in pigskin.

1012
00:57:22,012 --> 00:57:25,211
- So our culture is more
of a yeast after all.

1013
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:28,177
- Technology is ushering
in a neoclassical age.

1014
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:31,548
These columns of data,
tablets, icons, and graffiti

1015
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,829
are a continuation of the Roman arts,

1016
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,539
reappropriated ideals that form the basis

1017
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,204
for a monolithic social sculpture

1018
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,671
that is greater than the pyramids,

1019
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,414
the Parthenon, the Coliseum, Disney World,

1020
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:43,414
all manmade wonders combined.

1021
00:57:44,356 --> 00:57:46,675
Have you ever even wondered
why Mario is Italian?

1022
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:47,847
- Here's something.

1023
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,293
Why are we symmetrical vertically,

1024
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:51,024
but not horizontally?

1025
00:57:51,023 --> 00:57:53,836
- We actually don't look anything
like what we think we do.

1026
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:55,516
The lamp is five-dimensional.

1027
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:57,617
In the five-dimensional view of things,

1028
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,723
we are all one person,

1029
00:57:59,722 --> 00:58:01,657
one great person with invisible string

1030
00:58:01,657 --> 00:58:04,950
connecting all of our hands.

1031
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:07,612
All our hands are actually the same hand.

1032
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:10,827
- Winged-sandals!

1033
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:12,208
What a relief.

1034
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,081
Mustafa, how does it feel
to have a bird's eye view

1035
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:15,809
of time and space?

1036
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:17,873
- I'm dying to die,

1037
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:20,631
but there is no death inside of me.

1038
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,914
- They didn't even hide it,
they just left it on the bed,

1039
00:58:25,914 --> 00:58:27,413
now where is Aladdin?

1040
00:58:27,413 --> 00:58:29,519
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1041
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:32,371
Uncle Gary? Oh no!

1042
00:58:36,987 --> 00:58:40,100
(groaning)

1043
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:43,231
(evil laughter)

1044
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,888
- Aladdin!

1045
00:58:56,889 --> 00:59:00,490
Oh there you are, franchastic!

1046
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:01,475
- Well, Uncle Gary,

1047
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:02,603
I'm really glad that it happened this way

1048
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:04,092
because at least from inside there,

1049
00:59:04,092 --> 00:59:05,746
you can't hurt us.

1050
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:07,110
- Hurt you?

1051
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,112
Aladdin, I'm here to save you.

1052
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:13,851
I'm not your uncle.

1053
00:59:15,224 --> 00:59:16,674
I'm your dad.

1054
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:22,215
- King of kings, it's time
again for the Technology report.

1055
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:24,896
- I'm kinda busy right now;

1056
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,210
I have to thank all my friends

1057
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,797
for thanking my photos on Thankster.

1058
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:32,581
What are you wearing on your head?

1059
00:59:32,581 --> 00:59:35,007
- It's a hat, it records
everything I am thinking,

1060
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:37,840
it tastes like bananas,
and it's crushable.

1061
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,423
- Psychic soft electronics, incredible!

1062
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,922
How did you design such a thing?

1063
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:45,234
- I printed it,

1064
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:47,062
with this lamp that I confiscated

1065
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:48,967
from Magical America.

1066
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:50,018
Watch.

1067
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:52,690
Mustafa, print out a million drones

1068
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,371
and a million drone printing machines

1069
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:56,496
to print out a hundred million more.

1070
00:59:58,434 --> 01:00:01,230
- Genarro Russo,

1071
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,329
we can finally have anything that we want!

1072
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:21,994
- Aaah!

1073
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:24,607
Oh Aladdin, I don't know what to do!

1074
01:00:24,608 --> 01:00:26,860
Emily and her friends
are in jail for life!

1075
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,246
They delivered me her arm this morning.

1076
01:00:29,246 --> 01:00:30,952
- My poor daughter!

1077
01:00:30,952 --> 01:00:33,357
Aladdin, you must go save her!

1078
01:00:33,356 --> 01:00:35,050
- Who's that inside the lamp?

1079
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:37,206
That doesn't sound like Mustafa.

1080
01:00:37,206 --> 01:00:39,070
- Mom, Uncle Gary is
stuck inside the lamp,

1081
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,867
and now he says that he's actually Dad.

1082
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:42,284
- Gary?

1083
01:00:42,284 --> 01:00:43,855
- First off, Dad,

1084
01:00:43,855 --> 01:00:45,773
why did you abandon me in the mineshaft?

1085
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:47,766
If I hadn't rubbed the
lamp, I would have died!

1086
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:49,184
- The CIA was coming,

1087
01:00:49,184 --> 01:00:51,386
and I didn't want to risk
them getting the lamp.

1088
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:53,583
I came back the next day
but you weren't there,

1089
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,898
and I couldn't find you anywhere,

1090
01:00:54,898 --> 01:00:57,514
I've been looking for you for over a week!

1091
01:00:57,514 --> 01:01:00,758
- Due to the constant
irritation of Magical America,

1092
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,983
would you consider
hosting a mass-beheading

1093
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:05,067
later this afternoon?

1094
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:07,219
- Oh, I think if we
chopped off their heads,

1095
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:08,704
they would love it.

1096
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:12,242
- Also, it has come to
my attention from the CIA

1097
01:01:12,242 --> 01:01:16,077
that our Prince Average
Cabbage is not a prince at all

1098
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:19,855
but a recording artist
for Zintendo Records.

1099
01:01:19,855 --> 01:01:22,820
- Send the drones after him at once!

1100
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,832
- I was a wanted man!

1101
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:29,512
You see, after I left to
become an entertainer,

1102
01:01:29,512 --> 01:01:31,956
I ended up hanging out in Hollywood.

1103
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:35,184
The Sultan was hanging out too,
but he wasn't a Sultan yet,

1104
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,670
you see, he was the ne'er-do-well son

1105
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,260
of a former stunt kid who
had started his own religion.

1106
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,396
Me and the Sultan opened up
a children's massage parlor

1107
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:47,014
for rich and famous children.

1108
01:01:47,014 --> 01:01:49,963
But kids started to go
missing and I came to realize

1109
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:52,677
that the sultan was comparing
the size of his penis

1110
01:01:52,677 --> 01:01:55,208
with all the boys who came in,

1111
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,826
and every time there was a
boy who had a bigger one,

1112
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:59,023
he'd kill them.

1113
01:01:59,023 --> 01:02:01,195
Now the Sultan was so well
connected in Hollywood

1114
01:02:01,195 --> 01:02:02,882
that the cops wouldn't
do anything about it

1115
01:02:02,882 --> 01:02:04,564
no matter how much I begged.

1116
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:07,590
They even told him I was
trying to turn him in.

1117
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,184
The last thing he ever said
to me was to leave town

1118
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:15,184
and if he ever saw me again,
he'd kill me and my boy.

1119
01:02:19,538 --> 01:02:21,657
- Well, then, your cover is blown,

1120
01:02:21,657 --> 01:02:23,527
there's drones all over this house.

1121
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:25,525
The CIA will know everything.

1122
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:27,400
- You all have a disease

1123
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,427
and the only thing that will
cure it is sucking my dick!

1124
01:02:34,735 --> 01:02:36,816
Just kidding.

1125
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:38,172
You actually signed a contract

1126
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,650
allowing the Sultan to
kill and enslave you,

1127
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,048
perhaps you should read the fine print

1128
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,009
on your cell phone bills.

1129
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,796
- We already knew the
Sultan was a murderer.

1130
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,039
The Sultan is not a murderer, he's a king!

1131
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,378
In a couple of hours, you
will be smited by headsmen.

1132
01:02:52,378 --> 01:02:54,659
Thanks for playing the video game.

1133
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:56,510
- Fucking CIA pig.

1134
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,926
- Why do we assume pigs
are bourgeois policemen?

1135
01:03:02,873 --> 01:03:05,237
- Only last week, we
were trying to shed light

1136
01:03:05,237 --> 01:03:08,597
on dark, inhumane, secret government shit.

1137
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,010
What happened?

1138
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,399
- I'm in desperate need
of salad and religion.

1139
01:03:14,398 --> 01:03:16,279
- Considering the state of the planet,

1140
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,161
maybe people who think
of themselves as average

1141
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,079
are enlightened.

1142
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:27,958
- Now to reprogram this
Flesh-knob of disappointment.

1143
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:33,534
Mustafa, print me a 40-inch cock.

1144
01:03:35,034 --> 01:03:37,962
- Look at him treating the
lamp like it's his mistress.

1145
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:39,615
Despicable!

1146
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:48,778
- It fits right over the old one.

1147
01:03:48,778 --> 01:03:50,030
Wow!

1148
01:03:51,112 --> 01:03:54,151
(evil laughter)

1149
01:03:55,344 --> 01:03:59,581
Forty inches soft, I
didn't even think of that.

1150
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:01,404
Fair enough, Mustafa.

1151
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:13,032
♫ Bigger than yours bigger than yours

1152
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:17,132
♫ I like mine when it's bigger than yours

1153
01:04:17,132 --> 01:04:19,114
♫ Bigger than yours

1154
01:04:19,114 --> 01:04:20,490
♫ Bigger ♫

1155
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:26,936
(funky music)

1156
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:29,009
- Get your canned lamps here,

1157
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:34,010
canned lamps, free magical
3-D printing lamps in a can.

1158
01:04:36,362 --> 01:04:39,035
Hello Sir, what will you print?

1159
01:04:39,036 --> 01:04:43,384
- Thanks, I'm gonna print
a jungle of pornography.

1160
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:45,244
- Hello, ma'am, what will you print?

1161
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:48,880
- I'm printing a living
bird inside my brain.

1162
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:54,275
- Print me a digital pickaxe
to mine digital spacebux.

1163
01:04:57,346 --> 01:04:58,661
- Print me a contact lens

1164
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,340
that teaches my eyes to
think like an insect.

1165
01:05:03,143 --> 01:05:04,876
- That's cool!

1166
01:05:04,876 --> 01:05:06,683
- Print me a robot that
thanks all my friends

1167
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:09,070
for thanking my photos on 'Thankster'.

1168
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,251
- I like everything.

1169
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:17,149
Some things I like a lot,
but other things I just like.

1170
01:05:17,148 --> 01:05:19,340
- Print me an asparagus chair!

1171
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,110
Wow!

1172
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,789
By the way, who are you?

1173
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:32,273
- I'm the Princess.

1174
01:05:32,273 --> 01:05:33,768
- What?

1175
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:37,005
- I mean, I'm not the Princess,
I'm just a prince named "S."

1176
01:05:37,005 --> 01:05:39,316
- Oh, okay.
- That checks out, yeah, yeah.

1177
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:41,784
(calm music)

1178
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:44,590
- The surveillance drones
can't fly this high.

1179
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,978
- We'll get you out of
the lamp soon enough, Dad.

1180
01:05:46,978 --> 01:05:49,420
- I don't even want to
get out of the lamp!

1181
01:05:50,538 --> 01:05:52,699
Let me explain.

1182
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:56,813
All my life I've felt that
I was somehow degenerate,

1183
01:05:56,813 --> 01:06:00,461
and after some time of
practicing Dark White magic,

1184
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:01,902
I came to believe that the planet

1185
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:04,773
was mirroring my degenerate ways.

1186
01:06:04,773 --> 01:06:07,067
That night in the mines, I cast a spell

1187
01:06:07,068 --> 01:06:09,172
trying to summon Father Earth,

1188
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:11,695
I thought I could give
the planet a sex change.

1189
01:06:11,695 --> 01:06:14,884
I cut open my own penis
and turned it inside out

1190
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:16,126
as part of the ritual,

1191
01:06:16,126 --> 01:06:17,690
trying to unleash the information

1192
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:22,690
necessary to create Lover Earth,
the beautiful hermaphrodite.

1193
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:26,262
I thought I could turn the planet

1194
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:30,605
from degenerate to regenerate this way

1195
01:06:30,605 --> 01:06:33,632
and I mistakenly thought that my cock

1196
01:06:33,632 --> 01:06:35,762
was the Tree of Life.

1197
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:40,523
- Wow, yeah, the planet
probably does need a sex change.

1198
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:42,501
- Well, it turns out, Aladdin,

1199
01:06:42,501 --> 01:06:44,568
that you're gonna have a son,

1200
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:46,746
and your lamp and all that it creates

1201
01:06:46,746 --> 01:06:49,277
is basically just my grandson's cock.

1202
01:06:49,277 --> 01:06:53,110
So now I've crawled
into my grandson's cock,

1203
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,617
you need to cut it open,
turn it inside out,

1204
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:59,179
give birth to your father.

1205
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:02,438
- So the lamp is like a
womb inside of a dick?

1206
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:05,056
- Yeah, and after you open it,

1207
01:07:05,056 --> 01:07:08,135
the planet will become Lover Earth,

1208
01:07:08,135 --> 01:07:11,697
a planet where gender is no longer binary,

1209
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:13,488
nor is technology.

1210
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:18,023
- Print me vampires in submarines.

1211
01:07:18,023 --> 01:07:19,666
- Print me Pandora's Box bombs!

1212
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,931
- Print me pointy boots, see,

1213
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:24,362
I like to look down and see pointy boots.

1214
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:29,302
- That's the most epic,

1215
01:07:29,302 --> 01:07:32,113
brilliant, ace thing on the planet!

1216
01:07:32,112 --> 01:07:34,677
You're a total legend mate.

1217
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:37,105
Print me the biggest bindle of beak.

1218
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:42,713
- Print me the immortal
jellyfish regeneration algorithm.

1219
01:07:42,713 --> 01:07:44,702
- Print me my baseball
uniform that I love.

1220
01:07:44,702 --> 01:07:47,007
- Print me the hair from
last year's haircut.

1221
01:07:47,007 --> 01:07:50,069
- Print me everything I've ever lost.

1222
01:07:51,271 --> 01:07:53,238
- Out of the way!

1223
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,335
Out of the way!

1224
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:55,911
Stay back!

1225
01:07:56,996 --> 01:07:58,574
Stay back!

1226
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:05,023
- [Crowd] Free Ralph! Free Ralph!

1227
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,561
- Let him speak!

1228
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:10,762
- Yeah, why doesn't everybody pipe down

1229
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:12,983
and let him say somethin'.

1230
01:08:12,983 --> 01:08:15,155
- This place is starting
to look like Hollywood.

1231
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:18,028
You're just going to print
out an analogue version

1232
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:20,615
of the Internet, and
there's no room for it!

1233
01:08:20,614 --> 01:08:22,027
And since we are bound to this planet,

1234
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:23,423
industry and production can't mirror

1235
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,213
the infinite expansion of the universe,

1236
01:08:27,213 --> 01:08:30,865
though we fantasize about
filling the stars to their brim.

1237
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:33,551
We must change the nature
of what we wish for.

1238
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,804
- You know, Ms. President,

1239
01:08:42,805 --> 01:08:45,435
I don't remember Regular
Town being this big,

1240
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:47,172
what's going on over there?

1241
01:08:47,171 --> 01:08:51,142
- That's 982,000th Street
and 14,512th Avenue,

1242
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,965
the town has been expanding
as the world keeps printing.

1243
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:55,975
Holy shit, those are
anti-fungal chemtrails!

1244
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:57,548
- I can't see anything!

1245
01:08:57,547 --> 01:09:01,104
Aah, aah, aah!

1246
01:09:09,632 --> 01:09:13,833
(calm music)

1247
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:21,028
(all gasp)

1248
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:22,590
- Oh my God!

1249
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:30,163
(machinery noise)

1250
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:34,735
- Farmer Dave!

1251
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:37,097
- Hey, Aladdin, you little pervert!

1252
01:09:37,097 --> 01:09:41,233
(music intensifies)

1253
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,328
Open Sesame.

1254
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:08,096
- [Sultan] Ouch, my cock!

1255
01:10:10,091 --> 01:10:12,358
- Gimme my arm back, motherfucker!

1256
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:16,023
- Welcome back to the
two-armed girls club!

1257
01:10:16,023 --> 01:10:17,256
- Yeah.

1258
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:24,981
- Phew.

1259
01:10:29,097 --> 01:10:30,337
- I missed you.

1260
01:10:30,337 --> 01:10:33,277
(cheering)

1261
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,911
(calm music)

1262
01:10:41,911 --> 01:10:43,346
- (giggles) Hi!

1263
01:10:43,346 --> 01:10:44,676
- Hey!

1264
01:10:47,653 --> 01:10:48,628
All right, Dad,

1265
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:51,764
are you ready for
irreversible planetary status?

1266
01:10:51,764 --> 01:10:54,592
- C'mon, man, what have
I been talking about!

1267
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:58,105
(calm music)

1268
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:07,068
♫ I leave love behind her

1269
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:13,036
♫ I was scared to know her

1270
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:19,584
♫ Now the high is over

1271
01:11:20,595 --> 01:11:25,595
♫ Because I need a shoulder

1272
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,550
♫ Love is on its way

1273
01:11:33,109 --> 01:11:37,086
♫ Sometimes you're me from far away

1274
01:11:37,957 --> 01:11:41,597
♫ Just waiting to get blown hard ♫

1275
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,316
- Someone quick, help!

1276
01:11:57,363 --> 01:12:00,266
(life support beeping)

1277
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:01,284
- We plugged in his brain

1278
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:03,354
and it's downloading onto the mainframe

1279
01:12:03,354 --> 01:12:04,677
to the Undernet,

1280
01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:07,481
which is the Internet
that dead people use.

1281
01:12:07,481 --> 01:12:08,612
The other end of the universe

1282
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:10,869
doesn't seem very far away from here.

1283
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,554
There's pieces of it all around us

1284
01:12:13,554 --> 01:12:16,373
but our brains can't organize
the materials properly.

1285
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:19,824
- Us fifth-dimensional guys

1286
01:12:19,823 --> 01:12:23,840
can build a computer out
of a chair, no problem.

1287
01:12:25,136 --> 01:12:29,211
- Well, it's time to return
to the fifth dimension.

1288
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,426
- What is dying like?

1289
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:36,791
- At first, death emerges from within

1290
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:41,791
like a blackened burning insect

1291
01:12:41,948 --> 01:12:44,942
springing out of your bones,

1292
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:47,189
filling up your body

1293
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:50,577
with the brightest fluorescent colors,

1294
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:54,789
till your body is filled to the brim

1295
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:57,288
and language loses all meaning.

1296
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,221
Your mind is so fried from
contemplating googolplex

1297
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:09,221
that it gives way to fractals
and complex abstractions.

1298
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:15,679
Then the fluorescents
start to spin like a wheel

1299
01:13:17,953 --> 01:13:22,556
and that wheel carries
you off towards oblivion.

1300
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,807
- The deathbed is a horrible hang.

1301
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:32,238
- Aladdin, you're a pretty cool guy

1302
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:34,593
considering you came out of my dick.

1303
01:13:36,265 --> 01:13:39,987
(life support flat lines)

1304
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:42,016
I'm on the computer now.

1305
01:13:43,132 --> 01:13:44,661
- I love you, Dad.

1306
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:47,631
- That's nice.

1307
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,075
- You are the keepers
together of a sacred flame.

1308
01:13:57,461 --> 01:14:00,180
- I feel like we're inside a fiery cocoon.

1309
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:02,395
Where you are vulnerable,

1310
01:14:02,395 --> 01:14:05,813
I will build walls and
fortresses around those areas.

1311
01:14:05,813 --> 01:14:07,717
- I will always be the
closest person to you,

1312
01:14:07,716 --> 01:14:09,969
anything else requires an intervention.

1313
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,974
- Your feelings are always right.

1314
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:14,613
- I will persevere until
we agree on everything,

1315
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:16,909
even in a heated argument.

1316
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:19,018
There's no bluffing in our relationship.

1317
01:14:19,018 --> 01:14:20,953
- You are the hero of my heart.

1318
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:22,639
You are my heart hero.

1319
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:24,577
- You are my black magician.

1320
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:26,731
- I will be the Hashem to your Moses.

1321
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:29,268
- I will be the Guadalupe
to your Juan Diego.

1322
01:14:29,269 --> 01:14:31,981
- Home is wherever the two of us are.

1323
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,573
- I will share my intellectual
property with you.

1324
01:14:34,573 --> 01:14:36,413
- I will love you unconditionally,

1325
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:39,923
challenge you intellectually,
and sexualize you forever.

1326
01:14:39,923 --> 01:14:42,716
- I will give you the best
deal of any married man.

1327
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:45,529
- I will be eternally
devoted to our family.

1328
01:14:45,529 --> 01:14:49,264
- I will never question having
faith in doing life together.

1329
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:51,449
- You're under arrest,
because you're the best.

1330
01:14:51,448 --> 01:14:53,516
- You're under arrest
because you're the best.

1331
01:14:53,516 --> 01:14:56,889
(applause)

1332
01:14:56,890 --> 01:15:00,869
(calm music)

1333
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:09,048
- As a regenerate who has the world,

1334
01:15:09,048 --> 01:15:10,282
I must say it's nice to have a wish

1335
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:12,362
that I can make come true all the time.

1336
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,298
- I take care of the boy,
and the man takes care of me.

1337
01:15:16,298 --> 01:15:18,853
The prince was the genie,
and the genie was the prince.

1338
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:20,533
- I gave birth to my father.

1339
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:22,131
- Nice one, mate!

1340
01:15:25,529 --> 01:15:26,969
Let's go, mate.

1341
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:57,143
- Let's go back to Hollywood

1342
01:15:57,143 --> 01:16:00,154
and try to salvage what's
left of pornography.

1343
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:02,320
- Like preserve and archive it all

1344
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,189
on a giant hard drive in a giant building?

1345
01:16:06,203 --> 01:16:08,705
Great Sultan, you're too much.

1346
01:16:09,618 --> 01:16:12,867
- You think I'm too much,
but I'm not even enough.

1347
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:56,009
- Now that's the good stuff, mate.

1348
01:16:56,009 --> 01:16:57,506
Yeah.

1349
01:16:57,506 --> 01:17:01,818
♫ I'm phonin' in the blues
'cause my life ain't stallin'

1350
01:17:01,819 --> 01:17:03,497
♫ The phone just rang

know just how to call 'em

1354

♫ Baby that's how they call the blues

1355
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:27,094
♫ I'm phoning in the blues
like a phony version of the

1356
01:17:27,094 --> 01:17:30,886
♫ Blues that they thought that they had

1357
01:17:30,886 --> 01:17:34,926
♫ It was a phoney baloney
version of the blues

1358
01:17:34,926 --> 01:17:39,884
♫ It was the version that
I thought my baby had had

1359
01:17:39,884 --> 01:17:41,713
♫ I try to retract him

1360
01:17:41,713 --> 01:17:44,519
♫ My baby never had

1361
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,259

♫ The words I needed to soothe me

1373
01:18:43,712 --> 01:18:48,610
♫ Turned gray from being defenseless

1374

1386
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:44,415
♫ If she could ever see me like this

1387
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:47,238
