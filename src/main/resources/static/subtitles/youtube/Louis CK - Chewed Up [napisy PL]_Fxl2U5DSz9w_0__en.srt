00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,649

like a formula for how much your way

175
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:03,088
like a rule of thumb it i'm pretty sure

176
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:03,088
it's not your age plus 200 pounds

177
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,000
that doesn't seem like like I was

178
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,669
watching a boxing match today and the

186
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,110
you know like there's habits like

187
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:45,639
there's a pattern it's just chaos and

188

198
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,028
look well how soon into a meal do you

199
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,740
typically feel full and stop eating I'm

200
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:30,570
like I don't stop eating when I'm full

201
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:33,060
the meal is not over when I'm full the

202
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:39,900
meal is over when I hate myself that's

203
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:41,669
nice that's when I stopped I guess

204
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,559
normal people eat till they're like oh

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,960
this into useful energy throughout the

209
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:03,990
day now every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I eat it ends with me</font>

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,308
it doesn't seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal to most</font>

222
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,769
people but before boxer briefs I was

223
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:53,338
trapped between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two awful worlds of</font>

224
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,818
briefs and boxers briefs are for a

225
00:12:53,339 --> 00:13:00,899
normal man with one leg here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one leg</font>

226
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:04,259
here two totally separate legs with a

227
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,179
whole area between and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the briefs go up</font>

228
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,669
into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little Valley this little area</font>

229
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:10,799
and I come down like this and they can

230
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:13,558
just make it just tuck up in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

231
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,078
just hold them nicely because he's got

232
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:19,169
all that air and negative space but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

233
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:24,528
is just all just mashed together just

466
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:39,600
have a dog and I had a dog when I was a

467
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:41,309
teenager and yeah I did once I i made my

468
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,909
dog like cottage cheese off my balls

469
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:50,970
which is something you now can't unknow

470
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:53,610
you just know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did this and I only</font>

471
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,079
hesitated to start the sentence only

472
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:57,629
because I wasn't sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether to say</font>

473
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:01,859
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> left my dog like how does shoes</font>

479
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,880
way to put it

480
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,880

481
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:28,409

calm her down and then her little boy

869
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,659
walks up her he's got a handful of sand

870
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,930

873
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,849
right in her drink

874
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:33,659

878
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:48,548
have girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would never dream of</font>

879
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,798
