1
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,152
My colors... my colors...

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,158
They run hot in my veins...

3
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,194
Soft. So soft...

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,958
My colors are soft
like the Fall,

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,158
hot like fresh blood...

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,158
The liquid flows down
my arms

7
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,147
My colors... they transcend me

8
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,632
into darkness.

9
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,269
My colors

10
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,392
take me into the yellow decay

11
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,716
My colors

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,680
they flow through my veins

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,156
My colors

14
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,469
in my veins,

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,158
creating

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,350
a brutal nobility

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,912
God... My colors
will paint death clearly

18
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,869
Death, purity, death...
Purification... holding me

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,194
at their mercy. My colors...
yellow, soft, dripping from

20
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,149
their eyes. Purity.
Purity of death. My colors.

21
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,310
Good morning. I am Solmi.

22
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,550
Glad to meet you.

23
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,194
No, take hers, instead.

24
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,312
But no... women prefer
to carry their own these days.

25
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,157
Anyway, welcome to our
village. Coppola! The bags.

26
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,153
I am the one who wrote to you
the mayor who hired you

27
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,516
to restore the fresco,
the painting of St. Sebastian.

28
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,034
Let's go directly to the church,

29
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,918
so you can see it.
This is a tourist town.

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,151
The newspaper's beginning
to give us bad publicity.

31
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,588
Something must be done
to attract more tourists.

32
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,596
Driver, to the church!

33
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,557
I'm sure you'll do a good job.

34
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,153
- I hope so.
- The original painter,

35
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,151
Legnani, died a short while ago,

36
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,151
and he didn't finish the job.
The painting will remain

37
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,629
- an honor to him. At least.
- Yes, I understand.

38
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,278
The painter was good,
but he suffered

39
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,352
from a dark soul.

40
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,512
And those women...
Death was inevitable.

41
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
Hey! Are you sleeping?

42
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,750
No, not at all.

43
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,992
The pastor of the church
is in charge of the fresco.

44
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,468
I'll introduce you. He's a
good person. You'll like him.

45
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,348
This church was built,
destroyed and rebuilt 6 times.

46
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,870
Many times I threatened
to leave...

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,437
...but here I stay.

48
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,153
Solmi says you have done
a wonderful job here.

49
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,710
Thank you, he's kind.
Yes, this church

50
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,155
used to be an embarrassment!
A mess!

51
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,151
There were even cadavers
piled in here

52
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,151
from past funerals. I had
my work, yes. It was a mess.

53
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,391
After everything was cleaned up,
I hired the local artist, Legnani,

54
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,677
to paint a giant fresco
of St. Sebastian.

55
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,919
But there were many
problems, and the painting

56
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,430
remains unfinished.
Here, see what you think.

57
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,148
I am amazed! What an artist!

58
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,074
To have done such a job!
It's breathtaking!

59
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,717
It's truly magnificent!

60
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,872
But Legnani had a problem.
He was eccentric.

61
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,678
Legnani couldn't even
get dressed by himself.

62
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,831
His mind was somewhere else.

63
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,157
God gave him an amazing
talent, but he abused it!

64
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,634
They used to say he's crazy...
...maybe that's true.

65
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,915
- Are you starting now?
- No, I'm just checking.

66
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,199
Well, I'm going to get
something to eat.

67
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,399
I haven't eaten anything
since yesterday,

68
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,518
and I'm starving.

69
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,398
I hope you can make
that fresco beautiful!

70
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,153
Good luck!

71
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,069
Some people are so rude.
They never stop being nosy.

72
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,791
Take this. Thank you.

73
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,635
Who is it?

74
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,792
There's a phone call for you.

75
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,836
- It's over there.
- Thank you.

76
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,752
- Hello?
- Go away.

77
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,431
- You're here for the fresco...
- Pardon?

78
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,951
- Who's on the phone?
- Don't touch the painting!

79
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,793
- Hey, you look great!
- How are you?

80
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,235
I'm fine.

81
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,676
Here's the cheese.
Want coffee?

82
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,750
Yes, thank you.

83
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,509
Hello. Aren't you the man
I saw at the hotel?

84
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,353
At first you startled me.

85
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,479
- Are you busy?
- No, not really.

86
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,870
Sit down...

87
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,873
- This seat is already taken.
- Antonio!

88
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,193
- Excuse us.
- I'm gonna sit over there.

89
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,997
What are you doing here?

90
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,594
I came here for a good meal.

91
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,477
I'm surprised to find you

92
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,433
in such a desolate place!

93
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,557
- Are you still researching?
- For the moment...

94
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,636
Do you think I'm stupid?
Look around.

95
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,590
There's something weird
going on in this village.

96
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,239
- Did you break up with Marcella?
- That old bitch?

97
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,357
Don't say that to him.

98
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,158
Do you know who
this creature is?

99
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,152
Yes, she's a teacher, and
she's been fucked by everyone!

100
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,517
If you want to screw her
make sure you wear a condom!

101
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,227
- Did you meet with Solmi?
- Yes, this morning.

102
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,234
- Then you already saw the fresco.
- I saw it.

103
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,153
Don't talk to anybody.

104
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,157
Believe what I'm going to say.

105
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,392
I'm gonna tell you
a strange story.

106
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,149
Can I trust you, Stefano?

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,629
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

108
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,229
I have to go now.

109
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,392
I've decided to tell you later.

110
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,350
Hope things go alright.

111
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,237
I think your friend
drinks too much!

112
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,837
You have a nice room here.
Is it yours?

113
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,639
No. The school provides it.

114
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,153
Antonio says you're a teacher.
Is that right?

115
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,389
- Yes, that's right.
- Who do you teach?

116
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,153
I teach kids... who do you
think I teach?

117
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,548
- Oh, I don't know.
- How much sugar?

118
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,949
- Not a lot, thank you...
- Watch out. It's hot.

119
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,349
Don't spill it.
I just washed the blanket.

120
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,394
With you I feel younger.

121
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,915
Let me tell you something.
You have a sad face.

122
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,158
Don't be angry.

123
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,153
I feel like I'm getting old.
Not good.

124
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,589
If you feel lonely, come back.
You know the way.

125
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,998
I'll be waiting for your visit.
Not morning, I'm in school.

126
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,556
I'll remember that.

127
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,951
For you to understand
what I have to say...

128
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,634
I must take you
to a special place.

129
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,158
It's a house with odd windows.

130
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,158
Are you finally going to tell
that story from yesterday?

131
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,152
Or will this be bullshit?

132
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,348
Do you know what
we call him?

133
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,797
- Painter of Agony.
- I think that's true.

134
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,836
You think you know...

135
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,352
I'm talking about someone
who lived for death.

136
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,153
Come here, Foresti!

137
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,156
Here you go, doctor.

138
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,357
Thank. See you tomorrow.

139
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,159
Antonio, what about
this story of agony?

140
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,750
Good morning. Doctor,
that stuff you ordered for us...

141
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,719
...it should be here soon.

142
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,155
Listen, save your money.

143
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,479
I don't need it after all.

144
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,639
I told you it wasn't urgent.

145
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,634
Hey, you know what?
I've got to start working too.

146
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,350
Later!

147
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,153
- Do you mind if I come along?
- Not at all.

148
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,629
- What were you talking about?
- Nothing much.

149
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,198
The Painter and something
about death.

150
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,911
You have a bizarre friend.

151
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,510
Somebody threatened me on
the phone. Tried to scare me.

152
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,315
- Who might do this?
- Some people abuse the phone,

153
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,951
and they get into trouble.
Sometimes they arrest

154
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,478
a poor guy, but these tricksters

155
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,315
only stop when they want to.

156
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,159
Who put those flowers there?

157
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,828
I don't know. Why?
Don't you like them?

158
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,914
- That's it!
- No more!

159
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,150
Don't hit me anymore!

160
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,549
- Stop this!
- You're going

161
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,595
- to break everything!
- Stop!

162
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,879
Don't hit me anymore!

163
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,713
Stop it, understand?

164
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,719
Don't talk to me like that.

165
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,031
Go home... leave!

166
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,428
Can I have a cigarette?

167
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,790
It's finished.

168
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,158
- Thank you, marshal.
- Good night.

169
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,715
Sorry about the trouble.

170
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,916
This is the only restaurant

171
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,752
in the village. By the way,

172
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,634
- how do you find our food?
- Very good. I love it.

173
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,158
- Even though we have problems.
- The kitchen is very good.

174
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,549
It's good that the problems
don't affect it

175
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,073
I work hard, and thanks to Solmi.

176
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,153
He has helped a lot.

177
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
He's done much
for this village.

178
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,796
He's a brave man.

179
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,158
Though not tall, he's big.
He has railed the village...

180
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,158
...to unity and prosperity.

181
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,791
I'm sure you find these
pictures beautiful.

182
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,155
Like the one we have
in the church

183
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,436
These were painted
by the same artist

184
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,228
These paintings are the most
important thing in the village.

185
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,235
My wife. Everything in this
house belongs to her.

186
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,391
But how she suffers!
She's very sick...

187
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,270
She lives upstairs now... this is
her home. She wanders about...

188
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,871
She walks all over. Always.
This is her favourite painting.

189
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,275
- May I?
- Yes.

190
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,035
It was Legnani's first.

191
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,395
My wife is the model.

192
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,315
Quite startling... the detail!
Joy from the Painter of Agony.

193
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,359
Poor guy.

194
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,030
Never a success with women.

195
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,438
Overpowered by them...

196
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,835
A problem for him.

197
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,555
Maybe because he didn't
know his mother.

198
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,598
But one day he stripped down

199
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,831
and started painting his body.

200
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,153
Hello. Who's this?

201
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,393
One moment... It's for you!

202
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,588
- Hello?
- Don't mention my name.

203
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,433
I must speak with you.
I must tell you...

204
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,798
...the rest of the horrible
story... I'm at this hotel.

205
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,271
Someone pushed him
from upstairs!

206
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,159
Call a doctor!

207
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,914
No, he's dead!

208
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,476
It's impossible!

209
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,150
God!

210
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,111
Listen, I know
how you must feel...

211
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,951
...he was your friend.

212
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,914
Marshal, I'm sure someone
pushed him. I saw a shadow...

213
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,879
Besides, he had no reason
to commit suicide.

214
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,191
But there is no motive,
no reason for us to think

215
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,670
that someone killed him.
There is non evidence!

216
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,230
Nobody wanted to kill him.

217
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,597
He was a loner. Unhappy.

218
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,797
There is nothing to do here

219
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,555
except drink.

220
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,679
The young women... all left.

221
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,357
Your friend was alone.

222
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,238
Very alone.

223
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,391
Hello? Yes... Sir, it's for you.
Phone's over there.

224
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,155
Hello?

225
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,837
Go away.
Leave the fresco alone.

226
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,518
If you're trying to scare me
by phone calls...

227
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,159
...you're wrong.

228
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,356
- Go away. Leave.
- I'm not leaving. Understand?

229
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,720
Excuse me, sir,
one of our best clients

230
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,110
from out of town
arrive this morning.

231
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,556
- We gave him your room.
- What are you saying?

232
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,518
This man came to the hotel.

233
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,477
There was no room for him,
so we gave him yours.

234
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,950
We are very sorry, sir...

235
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,878
Do you like it?

236
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,153
I still have some left

237
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,152
from my fishing trip.

238
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,596
Want some?

239
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,111
You know, there are lots
more around here.

240
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,278
It's great!

241
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,591
- What's inside that box?
- What?

242
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,157
A secret.

243
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,240
Hey, let's go!
Are we going or what?

244
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,156
Hurry up!

245
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,153
How's my singing?
Not bad, huh?

246
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,158
Are you coming or not?

247
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,355
Hurry up!

248
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,990
If you stay here... you
can do what you want.

249
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,158
Come on! Here you go.

250
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,353
- Who does it belong to?
- That's not important.

251
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,150
Come here. This way.

252
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,157
Come on.

253
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,154
It's you?

254
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,878
- Is there something to eat?
- There is nothing here.

255
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,316
What did you do with
the money I gave you? Thief!

256
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,518
If you don't like what I bring,
go to a restaurant, old lady!

257
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,430
Why do you punish me like this?

258
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,071
- Who is this?
- Good morning.

259
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,158
He's a kind man.
He's gonna stay here

260
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,791
for a while... until
he finds a place.

261
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,388
It's been a long time since
I was visited by someone...

262
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,151
I'm all by myself here.
The silence is unbearable.

263
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,152
Where's the man
who took my room?

264
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,198
- Who do you mean?
- The new client.

265
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,510
There is no one. Who would
want to visit this village?

266
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,548
Who is it? Ah, it's you...

267
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,677
I didn't want to disturb you.
I thought you were sleeping.

268
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,153
Sleep? Me? Not quite.

269
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,152
How can a woman in
so much pain... sleep?

270
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,152
Can I ask you a question?
Do you hear noises at night?

271
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,148
- Noises?
- Yes.

272
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,152
- Last night?
- Yes. Noises.

273
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,115
The only person who could
bump into here is me...

274
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,672
and I'm not in that good of
shape to be walking around.

275
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,319
I don't think you're
in that bad of shape.

276
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,917
Come, young man.
Come next to me.

277
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,236
It's been a long time since
I've talked with anyone.

278
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,875
It makes me happy someone
is concerned about me.

279
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,157
So, how's the weather?
Is it nice out?

280
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,710
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

281
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,677
You'll come and see
me often, right?

282
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,549
- I promise.
- Goodbye, young man.

283
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,789
Is somebody there?

284
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,909
My colors. They are mine.

285
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,233
Let them run in my veins.

286
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,233
They are soft... soft.

287
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,798
They are soft like Fall,

288
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,997
hot like fresh blood...

289
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,547
the liquid flows down my arms.

290
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,879
My colors...

291
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,918
...they transcend me
into darkness.

292
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,072
My colors...

293
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,957
...take me into the yellow decay.

294
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,154
My colors... they flow
through my veins.

295
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,118
My colors, in my veins,
creating a brutal nobility.

296
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,272
Oh God, my God, my colors...

297
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,909
...will paint death clearly..

298
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,476
Death, Purity, Death,
Purification, holding me...

299
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,153
...at their mercy. My colors.
Yellow. Soft... dripping from

300
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,593
their eyes. Purity of death.

301
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,194
My colors... they purify death
through my veins...

302
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,838
Open up!

303
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:05,154
Is anyone home?

304
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,751
Yes?

305
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,469
Excuse me, I need to see
the woman who lives here.

306
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,559
She's no longer here.
Do you know what time is it?

307
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,711
Excuse me.

308
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,758
She left three days ago. I'm
her replacement at school.

309
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,157
She was transferred to another
district... won't you come in?

310
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,389
I'm sorry... but I was sleeping.
Excuse the way I look.

311
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,750
Please, do come in.

312
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,150
Earlier I ordered food from
the restaurant downstairs,

313
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,155
but I couldn't eat the escargot.

314
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,231
They are still alive! I didn't
have the heart to kill them.

315
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,155
Do you know how to cook them?

316
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,987
No. I don't think
I could eat them anyway.

317
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,840
- What's your name?
- Francesca.

318
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,358
Well, I'm going back to bed.

319
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,313
I hope we see each other again.

320
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,668
Hey! I put a live animal
in your friend's coffin...

321
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,429
...to keep him company.

322
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,278
Sir, I'm concerned about
the two women in the painting.

323
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,477
The killers of St. Sebastian
seem to be enjoying it...

324
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,797
Perhaps too much.
What do you think?

325
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,958
I think we have the wrong idea.

326
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,155
The painter did not have
the intention of depicting

327
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:56,151
the agony of the Saint.
Everybody says the artist

328
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:59,151
is a sensitive genius,
but all he does...

329
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,629
...is paint death... of a human,
without compassion.

330
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,590
Fishing is good around here.
The fish are very hungry.

331
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:09,716
Have you noticed much change
here, over the years?

332
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,792
The village suffered from war
after- shock. Everybody worked.

333
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,872
They rebuilt with
courage and hope.

334
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:19,159
Tell me about the woman living
at the house where I'm staying.

335
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:22,153
- Who? Paraplegic?
- Yes.

336
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,356
I don't see her much.

337
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,750
She's the type who doesn't
invite me to her house.

338
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:32,151
She hasn't left her bed in years.

339
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,151
People say she has
a venereal disease.

340
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,151
But I wouldn't know.
She doesn't go to confession.

341
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,754
Was she friends with
painter Legnani?

342
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:46,556
Please, don't ruin my day
with this kind of talk.

343
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,632
This kind of talk is even
scaring away fishes.

344
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,597
- What is this mumbo- jumbo?
- I didn't think you'd come back.

345
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,911
I came anyway.
I was waiting for you.

346
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,714
I've been here for 2 hours...
Curiosity made me play it.

347
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,793
- Who is the man talking?
- I don't know.

348
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,148
- Why do you live here?
- The priest suggested it.

349
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,911
Are you alone here?

350
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,753
No. There's an elderly woman
upstairs. She's nailed to bed.

351
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,594
I can't stop smoking.
It calms me down.

352
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,275
Do you still want
a cooking lesson?

353
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,670
- Escargos?
- No. Something much better.

354
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,150
- Do you know how to set a table?
- Yeah.

355
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:58,151
You'll find everything
you need in this drawer.

356
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,707
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Good.

357
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,360
I find a book in the
old lady's library...

358
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,159
..."Cooking For Romance".

359
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,152
What did you think of
the teacher I replaced?

360
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,149
- Did you like her?
- Pardon?

361
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,228
- Do you have a lighter?
- Right there.

362
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,347
Did you make love with her?
Your silence proves you did.

363
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,951
We stopped!

364
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,437
B. L.

365
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,036
Whose lighter is this? Do you
know a painter named Legnani?

366
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,313
No, it was a gift.
It's a friend's lighter.

367
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,755
The gloomy... darkness
is romantic. Right?

368
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,477
While eating this plate,
the lady and her knight

369
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,670
will feel love overpowering
their souls and desire is strong.

370
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,268
Do you have a lot of luggage?

371
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,916
One suitcase.

372
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,672
You could bring it over here.

373
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,396
What are you doing there?

374
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:54,587
Is there where Legnani lived?

375
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:58,069
- Who?
- The painter...

376
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:00,878
Can you drive me home?

377
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,159
Yeah. Hurry up.

378
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,152
Go ahead... sit in the front.

379
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,755
- Must I go directly home?
- Would you like to get a drink?

380
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,517
No. They won't serve me.
They think I should

381
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,197
be drinking fruit juice.
Like I can't handle liquor!

382
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:55,157
Thank you.
The next one's on me.

383
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:58,629
Just tell me about Legnani.

384
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,309
- Right now?
- Yes.

385
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,599
The painter... he went to
Brazil with his mother

386
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,872
and 2 sisters,
to find their fortune.

387
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,549
When they returned,

388
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,554
they were apparently
wealthier than before they left,

389
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,912
but mother was dead.

390
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,753
They came back and built
that little house.

391
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,153
Excuse me.

392
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,833
- How did they live?
- What?

393
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:45,475
- How did they live?
- He was poor...

394
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,155
He borrowed from everyone...
Even though they had a fortune,

395
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,918
he had nothing. His sisters
controlled the money.

396
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,638
You know, I knew him.

397
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:04,757
I was 7 or 8 years old.

398
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,197
She was dying. My mom was
sick. He came to draw her.

399
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,398
We called him the Painter
of Agony. He liked to paint

400
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,233
people who were dying.

401
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,838
He was a little crazy.

402
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,628
We could also say the same

403
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,153
about his sisters.

404
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:43,429
By painting death

405
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,273
he was trying to control nature,

406
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,272
to confront death.

407
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,592
He was obsessed with death.
And the dying.

408
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,757
Could you recognize
the sound of his voice?

409
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,312
Could you recognize it?

410
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,639
It's the kind of voice

411
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:16,552
you don't forget.

412
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,155
He talked like a psycho!
Like a machine gun...

413
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:26,112
Then suddenly he would
stop and start chanting.

414
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,836
- Psycho!
- Wait.

415
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:35,032
He was really crazy
because of his sisters.

416
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,474
- Plug it in. Quick.
- Yeah. Okay.

417
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:40,150
Listen to this.

418
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,152
There's nothing
on this damn thing!

419
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,828
- Did you touch it?
- Not since the other night.

420
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,758
This tape was important
to me, bitch!

421
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,918
What's wrong?
I didn't touch it!

422
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:40,949
I'm sorry...

423
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,436
I'll be right back.

424
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,150
Francesca!

425
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:15,030
Coppola?

426
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:59,514
Are you awake?

427
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,751
I slept a little bit,

428
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,439
but I had a bad dream.

429
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:12,829
I'm sorry.

430
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,158
I'm scared, you know.

431
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,672
Me too, but for me it's different.

432
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,157
I'm more afraid when I sleep.

433
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:55,592
There are a lot of things here,
and they're heavy!

434
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:45,549
- Is everything packed?
- Yes, just take it downstairs.

435
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,518
Incredible. Look, dear...

436
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,354
"To verify the death experience
of these models to reproduce

437
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,918
the very last moments of
death, his sisters provided him

438
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,713
with victims for his art"...
...Sisters!

439
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,597
Why did he write in third
person? Like a researcher,

440
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,233
to communicate with
the dead mother of Legnani.

441
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,193
He talks of communion...

442
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:52,151
...and human sacrifice.

443
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,878
There's a possibility
that a man, today,

444
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,918
can communicate with the dead,

445
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,918
during the ritualistic painting.

446
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:08,835
Stop it!

447
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,713
That's enough!

448
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,476
Shut up! I'm begging...
stop talking about it!

449
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,313
I can't stand this place
anymore. I want to leave.

450
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,838
Rio de Janeiro.

451
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:37,827
From Rio de Janeiro.

452
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,597
What? What is it? Tell me.

453
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,591
Probably the answer
to all the craziness.

454
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,758
Who is it?

455
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:52,157
- I'm sure it's them!
- Them?

456
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:55,151
- I must leave now.
- Take me with you.

457
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:59,949
No, stay here, get some rest.
Don't open the door for anyone.

458
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,838
Beautiful flowers,

459
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,000
beautiful flowers
in the garden,

460
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:37,879
show my love for you.

461
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,155
Beautiful flowers,

462
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,308
beautiful flowers
in my garden,

463
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,155
how do they grow, my lord?

464
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,956
Even today the sisters are
committing murder though art.

465
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,269
- What does this mean?
- Who's there?

466
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:28,438
Ah, it's you!
What are you doing here?

467
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:31,876
It's them! I tell you the
painter's sisters are...

468
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,157
...the killers in the fresco!
Look! Take a look!

469
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,751
It's true, they look the same.
Where did you find the picture?

470
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,150
We're beginning to understand
what my friend had figured out

471
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:50,151
- before he died.
- I don't know

472
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,276
- why you're so excited.
- I feel possessed by this!

473
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,238
The painting...

474
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,632
...the death of Antonio...
it's all too strange!

475
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:02,836
Yes, I believe you, but I may
not be on the right path.

476
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,275
I look at that cross and
have serious doubts.

477
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,157
- You're scared too?
- Yes.

478
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:12,198
God forgot to give me
courage. I'll admit it...

479
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,233
Promise me you'll stop this
crusade, heading the wrong way.

480
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,276
Why?

481
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,670
I've seen many like you break
down in the confessional.

482
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,955
Did you know the old lady
at the house is dying?

483
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:37,556
I was visiting her...
I gave her the last- rites.

484
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:50,394
Let me see.

485
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,431
Yeah, it's definitely them.

486
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,996
But tell me, where did
you find this picture?

487
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:05,632
It even surprises me that
those two would allow

488
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,473
a picture to be taken at all.
I've never seen one before.

489
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,835
Yeah, I know.

490
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:16,996
Well, what can you do?
I think being a psycho

491
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,509
is contagious.

492
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,149
When my wife was young
she was beautiful.

493
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,596
She was infatuated
with Legnani,

494
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,958
but he would only talk about
what he did with his 2 sisters.

495
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,272
A sad little house, close
to the railroad tracks...

496
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,147
They moved there after
the trip to Brazil,

497
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,237
and they brought back a
beastly savage religion.

498
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,789
One night, after he worked
on the fresco, Legnani decided

499
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,350
to end it all. Whenever he
painted, he was in such frenzy...

500
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,597
...madness engulfed his soul.

501
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:00,157
He couldn't separate
the reality from the illusion.

502
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,997
Blood and colors mixed
together in his tortured brain.

503
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:09,476
His sisters pushed him...
He finally stopped it all.

504
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,154
He forced them to watch
as he covered his body

505
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,551
with alcohol and set it ablaze.

506
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,911
He ran into the wilderness,
his body was never found.

507
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,916
- I told you: "presumed death".
- Why "presumed death"?

508
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,912
How many times
must I repeat?

509
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:43,197
If it says "presumed death"...

510
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:48,109
4th of June, 1931, it says
"presumed", not "confirmed".

511
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:50,760
Do you understand?
Presumed!

512
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,877
Caught on fire.

513
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:57,430
Run off. Period.

514
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,193
- Must I repeat it again?
- No...

515
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,229
Presumed death...
So he could still be alive.

516
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,154
What! With burns
all over his body,

517
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,673
such a man wouldn't be
too difficult to recognize!?!

518
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,479
I need 3 copies of these
certificates for tomorrow.

519
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,154
Look them up in the master file.

520
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:18,197
How many times do I say it.
This is not my job.

521
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,990
By the way, you haven't finished
your work at the church, right?

522
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:25,628
- No. Why?
- Because it's been destroyed.

523
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,637
Can you tell me who did this?

524
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,679
I don't know anything
about it. Someone, perhaps.

525
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:06,158
Maybe it was the Holy Spirit!

526
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,309
You poor son of a bitch.

527
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,277
Maybe we should call
a real specialist.

528
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,154
Leave me alone,
you degenerate.

529
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:51,192
Who's there?

530
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,272
Who's there?

531
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,354
Francesca!

532
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,559
Where are you?

533
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:21,229
Ah, there you are.

534
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:24,755
- It's been over an hour.
- I made a phone call.

535
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,997
- To whom? Do I know him?
- No, you don't.

536
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,717
I called the home office
in Rome.

537
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,552
I resigned my teaching job.

538
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,194
- You don't want to stay here?
- No.

539
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,157
Stefano, you know I hate it here.

540
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:49,873
I hate the ambiance
in this house.

541
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,516
I want to run away.

542
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:04,429
Something bad is going to
happen at any moment.

543
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,158
You said we would
always be together.

544
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,519
You're never here...
...I feel so alone

545
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:14,673
and I'm so scared.

546
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,547
Understand?

547
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,155
Do you want to leave me?

548
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,432
No, I won't leave you.

549
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,398
There's a train that
leaves tomorrow...

550
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,717
...at nine o'clock... let's go.

551
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,632
So stop crying.

552
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:26,157
Why didn't you wake me? Are
you going back to the church?

553
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,514
Last night you promised
we would leave together.

554
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,472
Why did you lie to me?

555
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,230
I didn't lie. I have a bit of time.

556
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:40,311
I need to check something.
You can count on me.

557
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:51,437
I'll give up everything for you.

558
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:55,036
My love.

559
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,639
Somebody there?

560
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,876
Good day.

561
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,474
I brought back the bike.
It's outside.

562
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,438
- So you're leaving.
- Yeah, I'm leaving.

563
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,231
- Can you tell me something?
- Sure.

564
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:36,755
- Do you sell muriatic acid?
- Of course. Want some?

565
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,957
Who brought some recently?

566
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:42,155
It was used to destroy the fresco.

567
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:46,313
I sell it often to everybody
in the village...

568
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,994
...Who knows?

569
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:52,149
You don't write it down?

570
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,515
Why? I know everybody.

571
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,557
Everybody buys it.
It's used to clean.

572
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,313
I sell it to everybody.

573
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:15,997
Take me home. I need
to pick up Francesca.

574
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:22,829
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- They abused me.

575
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,509
Who?

576
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,557
Them, all of them.

577
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,591
They were afraid I would talk,

578
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,479
but she thought she could buy

579
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,679
my silence with a bit of booze.

580
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:53,868
But no more! The last drink!

581
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:03,157
The sisters are still here.

582
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,277
Alive.

583
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,154
Get closer. Listen...
I'm the only one

584
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:18,387
who has seen them in
action, and it's horrible.

585
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:21,798
- What do you mean?
- They tried to get me,

586
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,752
but I escaped.

587
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,957
When I was little,
I went to school with them.

588
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,877
Everybody thought
I was stupid

589
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:39,679
because I didn't go to church,
but I had a good reason.

590
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,277
I knew what was there. I knew
the danger. I don't want to...

591
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,034
...die there. Others shut their
eyes. Ignored it. But me...

592
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,356
...Coppola is still alive!
Why Coppola is still alive?

593
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:58,390
Because I ignore the others.

594
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,269
- You think I'm rotten?
- No.

595
01:19:04,359 --> 01:19:07,157
- For real?
- Yeah.

596
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:21,152
Here the walls have ears.

597
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:25,157
My friend died because of that.

598
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:29,474
True?

599
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,916
I don't know about your friend,

600
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,957
but I know...

601
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,797
You're curious.

602
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:48,471
There's a place where
people like you...

603
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,157
...lose their heads!

604
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:58,795
Come with me! Quick!

605
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:26,719
Is it you?

606
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,667
It's here.

607
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,154
This is a weird house.

608
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:52,472
Many people have
disappeared here.

609
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,354
Why'd you bring me here?

610
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:33,068
I know the missing people
are all here. Buried here.

611
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:43,794
There's an example.

612
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,155
Once, I thought I would
end up in this hole too.

613
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:23,152
Stefano?

614
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,392
Stefano?

615
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:54,357
You weren't expecting me,
were you?

616
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:58,318
You take care of kids, right?
So take care of me!

617
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:01,152
You aren't scared of me,
are you?

618
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:04,277
- Nobody's scared of Lidio.
- No!

619
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:08,750
You like me, don't you?
There are many things I want!

620
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,274
Your skin drives me crazy!
Don't you want me?

621
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:16,557
Give yourself to me!
Why resist. I'm stronger!

622
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,154
Stop it!

623
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,197
Why are you fighting me, bitch?

624
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,552
- Don't scream!
- Stop it!

625
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,792
You'll wake up the old lady!

626
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,552
- Shut up! Don't fight me!
- No! No!

627
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:28,038
I'll take you to a house with
odd windows... smiling...

628
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:27,476
Go get Francesca.
I'll wait for you.

629
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,791
Stefano, don't take long.

630
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:34,555
Come fast!

631
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:45,198
Francesca!

632
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,752
Francesca, are you ready?

633
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,469
Francesca, are you there?

634
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,476
Madam, have you seen...?

635
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,160
Francesca!

636
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,792
No!!

637
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,148
Francesca!

638
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:03,394
Coppola!

639
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,154
Yeah, it's here.

640
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,150
Follow me. This way!

641
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:25,231
I know where they took her.

642
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,472
- There, right there.
- Hurry up. Dig!

643
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,154
Cigarette?

644
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:46,277
What now, chief? Continue?

645
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,917
This probably surprises you,
but nothing's here.

646
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,560
I'm sure there's something.

647
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,154
I saw bones, blood...

648
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:03,673
Who showed you that?
Who brought you here?

649
01:31:04,119 --> 01:31:07,668
Coppola, Mr. Solmi's
chauffeur.

650
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:10,589
- Coppola? Are you sure?
- Yes.

651
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,918
Okay me, let's go.
Coppola is a drink idiot.

652
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,560
He made you look stupid,

653
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,511
but you're not the first.

654
01:32:08,359 --> 01:32:11,157
Hey you! Where
did you find him?

655
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:14,311
By the ravine near the church.

656
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:19,830
We'll get him to you
in a moment.

657
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,157
- He's heavy as a bull.
- Pull a little.

658
01:32:33,319 --> 01:32:36,152
There must be more alcohol
than water in his body.

659
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,515
What are these scars?
I've never seen them before.

660
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:45,909
They're war injuries.
He stepped on a mine.

661
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:52,152
God, he looks terrible.

662
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,752
Take the body to the morgue.

663
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,752
Come on, men.

664
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,239
Does anybody know
where he was all day?

665
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:14,152
No, he hasn't been
home for a week.

666
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,434
Oh well, check on it.

667
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:23,431
You. I don't want you to
go anywhere. Stay with me.

668
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,399
No, better yet. Come to my
office in the morning.

669
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,597
Understand? Sir?

670
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:33,827
I understand.

671
01:33:56,319 --> 01:34:00,915
Come on, let's go.
I'll take you to the hotel.

672
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,674
- I have to find them first.
- It's not the right time. Let's go.

673
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:19,789
Yes? One moment.

674
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:23,719
- You're wanted on the phone.
- Who?

675
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,314
I don't know.

676
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:37,157
- Hello?
- Hi...

677
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:40,152
...It's me, Francesca.

678
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,152
Come! I'm waiting for you...

679
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,637
...at the house.

680
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:51,073
My love...

681
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,757
...I'm scared.

682
01:34:56,359 --> 01:34:59,510
I'm waiting for you at home.

683
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:02,913
Come now... hurry up!

684
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,718
You degenerate!
Aren't you ashamed?

685
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:53,318
Come, come closer.

686
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,512
I'm going to show you
something.

687
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:06,351
See. It's my little brother.

688
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:10,157
He will return to us soon.

689
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,599
We continue to bring
models to him.

690
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:16,752
He lived through others
people's death.

691
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,239
Come with me.

692
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,470
You are a friend
of our little brother,

693
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:29,151
aren't you, sir?

694
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:34,029
My colors... from my veins...

695
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,270
Purity, Death...

696
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:44,833
Do you know how we keep
him? Formaldehyde.

697
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,592
Lidio brings us new
formaldehyde every day,

698
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,715
but today Lidio stopped
to see your girlfriend.

699
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,510
He raped her, he killed her.
We had planes for her,

700
01:38:01,239 --> 01:38:06,154
but he messed everything up.
We had to find a replacement.

701
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,349
Come, don't be scared.

702
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,552
He looks like the man
in the fresco, doesn't he?

703
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,712
Bravo! You didn't miss!

704
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,632
Hold him!

705
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:31,350
He's moving too much!

706
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,151
Get him from the other side!

707
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,159
He's probably hiding
in this bushes.

708
01:39:11,479 --> 01:39:14,152
It's useless to keep
looking.

709
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:17,152
He won't get far.

710
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:23,431
Tomorrow we'll come back
and get his body.

711
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,474
We'll get him.

712
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,160
Please, I beg you!

713
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:07,152
Open up!

714
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,514
Solmi!

715
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,559
Hello, give me the police.

716
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,354
Open up!

717
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,150
My God, Stefano!
What happened?

718
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:06,918
You're my only hope.

719
01:42:08,199 --> 01:42:11,795
I know what's going
on here, it's them.

720
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:17,668
I know everything.

721
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:22,837
Call a doctor, please.

722
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,952
The painter's sisters...

723
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:34,510
Legnani's sisters
are still alive!

724
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:38,878
Alive...

725
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:47,153
...still alive...

726
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:51,357
One of them owns
the house!

727
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,878
- The paraplegic?
- Yeah, they're alive.

728
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,478
The other one... I didn't
see her face...

729
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,155
That's a nasty wound. It
would make a nice portrait.

730
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,877
Legnani would make
a masterpiece out of it!

731
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:18,634
But you are...

732
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:27,953
Beautiful flowers,

733
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:32,192
beautiful flowers
in the garden,

734
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,548
show my love... for
you... my lord...

735
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:05,590
Laura, come see!
