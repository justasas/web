1
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:51,579
Eva.. So.

2
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,450
Nick.. Hi.

3
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:53,320
Eva.. Hi.

4
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,009
Eva.. Can I really try it?

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,829
Nick.. Yeah, of course. No l was lying.

6
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,689
Eva.. That's kind of weird.

7
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:03,969
Eva.. Oh my god that's so good.

8
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,310
Nick.. Can I ty that?

9
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:06,709
Eva.. Yeah, of course.

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,069
Eva.. It's definitely not bad; it's pretty light
and nice but it doesn't compare to that.

11
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,599
Nick.. Yeah, no.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,920
Eva.. That's like so full.

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,890
Nick.. I win. Yeah. It's so delicious.
Frankenhousen.

14
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,239
Eva.. Nick -- one.

15
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:20,438
Nick.. Yeah. Nick -- one.

16
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:21,510
Eva.. Eva -- zero.

17
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,409
Nick.. Eva -- zero.

18
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,900
Nick.. Is this like the first time you've done
this? This internet dating thing? This is
like the first time I've done this, so...

19
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:32,679
Eva.. Yeah. l just had one. l like met a guy
at a bar for drinks. That was it.

20
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,560
Nick.. That's it? There's...?

21
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:35,989
Eva.. It was kind of awful actually.

22
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:38,468
Nick.. Oh, it was awful, okay now we're
getting somewhere. What happened?

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,200
Eva.. Well, you know, nothing, but like, l
was there early. l just got there early,
whatever.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,569
Eva.. And l was waiting for him and he was
like 20 minutes late.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,019
Nick.. That always sucks.

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,700
Eva.. Then he shows up and he's wearing
a popped collar and l was like, ''Done with
you. Next.''

27
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,819
Nick.. That's... yeah... totally. l mean if you
would have been wearing a pop collar l
would have been out of here, also.

28
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,219
Eva.. But, yeah, that's the extent of my
internet dating...dating.

29
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,530
Eva.. You're a filmmaker, yes? Sory, l was
tying to remember your profile.

30
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,158
Nick.. l ty to make films. Basically, l have
been working on this one thing for like two
years

31
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:17,698
Nick.. and l'm like totally stuck with it
though so l am all like stressed and cranky
about it.

32
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:22,378
Eva.. What's it about? You so don't want to
talk about it.

33
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:29,008
Nick.. Aside from that, much less stressful
project l'm working on is this music video
for my friend's band.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,938
Eva.. Cool.

35
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:32,168
Nick.. Yeah.

36
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,378
Nick.. Okay. Here's my stock question..
What kind of music do you like?

37
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,449
Nick.. What?

38
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,939
Eva.. That is so lame. That's lamer than...

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,629
Nick.. You just asked me what l do.

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,080
Eva.. You made fun of me for ''what do you
do.'' How is... so lame.

41
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,219
Nick.. l didn't make fun of you that much.

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,990
Eva.. Eva, wherever l am. Two? Do l have
two?

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,129
Nick.. One.

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,909
Eva.. One? Whatever, l get a point for
that.

45
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:56,199
Nick.. Whatever.

46
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,710
Eva.. Anyway... l could start listing bands
but you're not going to know any of them.

47
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,319
Nick.. What? How do you know that?

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,259
Nick.. l might know more about bands
thank you've like...

49
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,860
Eva.. It's just a hard way to answer a
question. It's a stupid question.

50
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:08,718
Nick.. Okay...

51
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,280
Nick.. What's the last thing you listened to?

52
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,030
Eva.. Ohhh...okay...have you ever heard of
this band 'applecury'?

53
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:16,628
Nick.. Yeah, totally.

54
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:17,859
Eva.. Really?

55
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:19,709
Nick.. No, l totally haven't.

56
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:22,429
Eva.. Oh my god l would have been so
excited, they're so good.

57
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,500
Nick.. Sory.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,009
Eva.. So applecury...

59
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,530
Eva.....you just broke my hearrt. l was like
''Oh my god he's heard of them.''

60
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,780
Nick.. No but now there's this opporrtunity
for you to share that with someone.

61
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,718
Eva.. Absolutely. They're like a...what do
you call it...

62
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,669
Eva.. Actually, are you on The Lionshare?
Or have you heard of it?

63
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,658
Nick.. The Lionshare? No, l'm not on it and
l haven't heard of it; both those things.

64
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,658
Eva.. Well it's like a bit torrent site, you
download like movies and music and stuff.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
Nick.. Yeah, l know what you're talking
about.

66
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,939
Eva.. You have to be invited though. So if
you give me your e-mail l could invite you.

67
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,069
Nick.. Oh, that's tricky.  l don't know if l
want to do that.

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,360
Eva.. Why?

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,930
Nick.. l don't know if we're at that level yet.
Where l could just give you my e-mail.

70
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,849
Eva.. Fine.
Nick.. l'm kidding...

71
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,840
Eva.. Then you'll never hear about
applecury again.

72
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,580
Nick.. Nick, my name. O, as in the letter.

73
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,099
Eva.. Got it.

74
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,050
Nick.. And rette, like nick-o-rette, like the
gum. R-E-T-T-E.

75
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,020
Eva.. Why the gum?

76
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,220
Nick.. l don't know, l like gum.

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,120
Eva.. So, l'm going to going to send you
my last invite

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,639
Eva.. and you have to download
applecury.

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,230
Nick.. l will.  l will, why wouldn't l do that?
That's why l was like ''Oh l want to check
that out.''

80
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,350
Eva.. Well, what if you forget who they
are?

81
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,088
Nick.. Okay.

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,500
Eva.. applecury is the name of the band.
Sory does that hurrt?

83
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,120
Nick.. No, it tickles a little bit.  Is there
anything else you want to put down there?

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,459
Eva.. Favorite color?

85
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,040
Nick.. Yeah, l mean, just write your whole
profile so l can look at it whenever l want.

86
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,250
Nick.. Okay, cool.

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,500
Eva.. Awesome.

88
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,629
Nick.. Thanks.

89
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,819
Eva.. So, how long have you known you
wanted to be a filmmaker?

90
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,949
Eva.. l'm just curious because like l still
don't know what l want to do.

91
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,588
Nick.. Totally yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

92
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,430
Nick.. l don't know, ummm...

93
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,730
Nick.. We had my dad's big clunky VHS
camera. Like it was bigger than us. l feel
like evey family had these.

94
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,199
Eva.. Yeah we totally did.

95
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:17,430
Nick.. And we decided to re-make
Ghostbusters.

96
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:19,350
Eva.. Cool.

97
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,040
Nick.. Yeah, it was totally awesome.

98
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,088
Nick.. It was weird because all my friends
were really into the whole pretending and

99
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,319
Nick.. being in the movie thing but l like
really enjoyed being behind the camera.

100
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,500
Eva.. Uh-huh.

101
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:41,069
Nick.. And that was something l knew l
liked more than what they were doing so l
always ended up being there.

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,649
Eva.. That's so awesome.

103
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,439
Nick.. l guess. l mean, yeah.

104
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,088
Eva.....l've never seen Ghostbusters.

105
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:55,129
Nick.. What? Really?

106
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,329
Eva.. Yeah. l mean, like, there's plenty of
things l haven't seen but l've not seen
Ghostbusters.

107
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,350
Nick.. And Ghostbusters is one of them?

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,278
Nick.. All right. That...l can't...all right.
That needs to be rectified immediately.
Like now.

109
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:11,199
Eva.. l think l'd rather see your version of
Ghostbusters.

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,990
Nick.. This is -- this is -- this is way bigger
than just me.

111
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,759
Eva.. It was a carrtoon though too, right?

112
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,560
Nick.. Yeah it was a carrtoon, but you
haven't seen the movie?

113
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,899
Nick.. We need to watch Ghostbusters
right now. Like, for real. l don't know.

114
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,670
Eva.. There is a Blockbuster on the way to
my house.

115
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,519
Nick.. Is there?

116
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,980
Eva.. Just throwing it out there.

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,699
Nick.. They might in fact have a copy of
Ghostbusters that we could then watch at
your house.

118
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,240
Nick.. And...they don't have it.

119
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,199
Eva.. Seriously?

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:06,959
Nick.. Seriously.

121
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,338
Eva.. Where are you even looking?

122
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,600
Nick.. They have it, but...

123
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,829
Eva.. Ohhh and it was the Collector's
Series too. Should we ask? Maybe they
have it like in the back.

124
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,449
Nick.. Yeah.

125
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,069
Eva.. Do they have a back or...

126
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,579
Nick.. l mean, they might have it in the
front.

127
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,620
Nick.. l don't know maybe they have it at
like... l don't know.

128
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,829
Nick.. l would buy it. l would buy another
copyjust for this occasion.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,870
Nick.. But l don't see anywhere in sight...

130
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,509
Eva.. l don't know where you could.

131
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,100
Nick.....that would actually sell DVDs.

132
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,110
Nick.. l don't know. What do you think?

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,910
Eva.. Lionshare...

134
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,439
Nick.. Lie and share?...all right.

135
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,889
Eva.. It's all one word, right?
Ghostbusters.

136
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,720
Nick.. It's not going to matter in the search
field.

137
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,838
Eva.. Awesome. It's downloading.

138
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,069
Eva.. It'll probably take about an hour,
maybe two hours...

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,410
Nick.. Cool. What?

140
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,538
Eva.. Do you want a drink? l have beer.

141
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,308
Nick.. What is this?

142
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,480
Eva.. It's my favorite little opener. See?

143
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:43,949
Nick.. l can't.  l can't handle that.

144
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,860
Eva.. Cheers.

145
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:46,840
Nick.. Cheers.

146
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,028
Eva.. To...Ghostbusters.

147
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,259
Nick.. Yeah, to Ghostbusters downloading.

148
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,548
Eva.. To finally seeing it.

149
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,788
Nick.. And to me seeing it for like the
millionth time.

150
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:05,019
Eva.. It's a pretty good job though. It's like
super chill, l can wear whatever l want. l
can like just hang out. It's a good job.

151
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,570
Nick.. That's cool. Do you have a title?

152
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,889
Eva.. Record Label Do-Stuff girl. That
would be my title, l think.

153
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,789
Nick.. That's a pretty awesome title.

154
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,090
Eva.. You win.

155
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,019
Nick.. Yep.

156
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,048
Eva.. That's embarrassing.

157
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,058
Eva.. Do you want another?

158
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,278
Nick.. Uh, yeah. Sure.

159
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,519
Eva.. Oh, you're not actually done. l could
have won.

160
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,470
Nick.. Too late now. That's a pretty
satisfying sound.

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,278
Nick.. Your hair's all like...

162
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,759

Nick.. Later.

197
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,629
Matty.. Maybe he's just over-worked, you
know?

198
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,450
Bracey.. How long does it take to get from
the fucking front door to right here?

199

Bracey.. [singing] Oh...l...just got laid last

Nick.. Yeah, man. That was like the first
thing we did. We just took it from there,

210
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,028
Bracey.. l sense sarcasm.

211
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,710
Matty.. All right. Well, you going to see her

212
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,700
Nick.. l don't know. Hopefully.

00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,759
Matty.. Yeah, seriously man. l mean is

215
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,678
Nick.. Give me a second guys. Geez.

216
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,689
Matty.. Come on man. We've been
camped out here all night.

217
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,350
Bracey.. All night long.

218
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,750
Nick.. You guys know what happened,
man. l said it was a good night, all right?

219
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,769
Matty.. Look at that face. He wants to tell
us but he really can't.

220
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,210
Bracey.. All right fine, fine, you don't want
to say anyything, that's cool.

221
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,960
Matty.. l can deal. l can deal.

222
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,389
Bracey.. You've changed. He's changed.

223
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:31,700
Matty.. You know, l'm just a friend who's
concerned about my friend getting action
but if you don't want to tell me

224
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Matty.. anyything, that's cool by me. l'm
over here with my little Nintendo, my
internets.

225
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,190
Matty.. l'll be fine.  l'll occupy myself.

226
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:41,080
Bracey.. That's the song.

227
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,110
Nick.. The demo?

228
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,110
Bracey.. It's the second track, yeah.

229
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,038
Nick.. All right, awesome.

230
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,450
Matty.. Oh yeah. Is that the one you're
going to make the video for?

231
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,418
Nick.. Yeah, hopefully.  If you still want me
to do it.

232
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:51,990
Bracey.. l do want you to do it, yeah,
totally.  l just want you to, you know, listen
to it first.

233
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,700
Nick.. l'll listen to it, l'll ty to get some
ideas, you know.

234
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,950
Matty.. It is the beginning of bear mating
SeaSOn.

235
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,690
Matty.. What?

236
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,970
Matty.. No, l mean bears, they're starrting
to mate now.

237
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,470
Matty.. What? It's a bear fact.

238
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:15,048
Bracey.. Bear fact? What are you in?
Third grade? What is that? A bear fact...

239
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,879
Matty.. There's a direct correlation
between bears and Nick.

240
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,330
Nick.. What website are you looking at??

241
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,028
Matty.. This is my world.

242
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,620
Bracey.. You gotta get off that bestiality
kick man, that's really nasty.

243
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,230
Matty.. That's gross.

244
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,429
Nick.. It's too much.

245
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:33,360
Matty.. Look, l'm just saying there is a
direct correlation between the bears and
you and us...

246
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,370
Matty.....it's hunting season man. It's
potent, it's in the air. You just gotta reach
out and grab it, you know?

247
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,058
Bracey.. What are you guys doing
tomorrow? Tomorrow night, specifically.

248
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,470
Matty.. l think l might see the new James
Bond movie with my dad. It's a
hearrtwarming experience, l know.

249
00:15:46,308 --> 00:15:50,259
Bracey No, sounds good. l'm going to be
playing at Stain if you're free, Nick.

250
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,139
Nick.. l think l might actually end up
seeing that girl again, hopefully.

251
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,788
Bracey.. l mean, that's awesome. And if
you're looking for something to do you can
bring her

252
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:03,220
Bracey.. and tell her to bring some of that
hot honey with her.

253
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,529
Bracey.. Bear fact, shit.

254
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,759
Nick.. l don't know.  l'm kinda reluctant
about that idea.  l think it's pretty terrible,
Bracey.

255
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,580
Bracey.. Why?

256
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:17,269
Nick.. What if she doesn't have any friends,
she'll just end up going home with

257
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,288
Nick.. you or some other stubbly, scruffy ,
guitar-playing...

258
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:24,379
Bracey.. You always do this. No. When
has this ever happened? Why...

259
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,450
Nick.. This always happens.

260
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,639
Matty.. It's true, man. A guitar is like
nature's pussy magnet.

261
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,678
Nick.. Bear fact.

262
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:30,990
Matty.. It's a bear fucking fact.

263
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:33,918
Nick.. Equals.

264
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,340
Bracey.. Yeah, alright. Maybe l'll see you
tomorrow.

265
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:40,829
Bracey.. Matty, have fun with your pops.

266
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,379
Matty.. Uh-huh.

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,788
Nick.. Later man.

268
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,759
Bracey.. All right, later guys.

269
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,090
Nick.. Later.

270
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:52,370
Bracey.. [muffled] God damn door. You're
gonna have to fix this shit...

271
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,110
Matty.. No, what was that about anywa,y?
Yeah l know. Dad? l said it was fine
okay?

272
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,470
Matty.. We can probably just catch another
showing another time, okay? l don't know
even if it's still playing.

273
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:15,028
Matty.. Well there's a show coming up that
my friend's... no, you don't know him. Dad,
you don't know him.

274
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:19,390
Matty.. His name's Bracey, he's in a band
and he's playing a show and he really
wants me to go so...

275
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,818
Matty.. l don't know. Nothing really
unusual.

276
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,339
Matty.. She seemed fine.

277
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,420
Matty.. Yeah well l mean what did you
expect?

278
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:39,058
Matty.. Dad? Dad? l am fine, okay. l
mean, l got paid last week.

279
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:43,818
Matty.. Alright well when l go to the show

280
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:47,759
Matty.. and then maybe we can see if we

281
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,118
Matty.. see it or just give me a call. We'll

Matty.. All right. l love you too. Bye.

283
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,910
Matty.. Oh no. Oh god what have l

284
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,078
Nick.. Yeah. We got to put a stop to that
as soon as possible.

285
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,068
Matty.. Yeah, right in its bear tracks.

286
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,788
Voice.. Drive 1.5 miles then keep left on
l-278.

287
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,940
Matty.. Okay. Thank you.

288
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,538
Nick.. Yeah we're gonna be late.

289
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,720
Matty.. We're gonna be late.

290
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:57,269
Nick.. No doubt about it.

291
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:01,940
Nick.. We're going to walk in and Bracey's
just gonna be like uhhh-AAHHHH-uhhhhh

292
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,099
Nick.. ''Thank you eveybody. That was our
Iast song.''

293
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:09,298
Matty.. That's happened to me once. He
didn't care though.

294
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:15,058
Nick.. l thought of calling what's her face
but l didn't.  l was like, yeah...

295
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,500
Voice.. Please drive to highlighted route.

296
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,058
Nick.. It's too soon.

297
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:23,088
Matty.. Do you watch Project Runway?

298
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,818
Nick.. Not really, no. Why?

299
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,630
Matty.. Well, the girl l have a massive
crush on...

300
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,329
Nick.. Yeah.

301
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,250
Matty.....is the winner. So, that kind of
perked up my day a little bit.

302
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,909
Nick.. Did you celebrate her victoy with
Jane?

303
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,710
Matty.. Oh, yeah. Actually Jane was the
one that got me on to the show.

304
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,640
Nick.. Got you... oh so you were a
contestant?

305
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:45,230
Matty.. No yeah, you don't remember when
l was a contestant on the show?

306
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,419
Nick.. Yeah, can't believe l didn't
remember that.

307
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,088
Matty.. Well, you know those situations
where you have a girlfriend and they have
a TV show they have to watch?

308
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:57,088
Matty.. l basically watch whatever she
watches and she watches Project Runway.
So l starrted watching Project Wunway.

309
00:19:57,088 --> 00:20:01,450
Matty.. Project WUNway. Project
RUN...way.

310
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,598
Matty.. l starrted watching Project RUNway.

311
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,598
Matty.. But yeah, she has all these shows
she needs to watch so l watch them.

312
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,679
Matty.. l mean it's like, l have no shows l
need to watch.

313
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,009
Nick.. l'm like the complete opposite of
that. l'm even worse than her l need to
watch

314
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:23,470
Nick.. pretty much everything. Not
necessarily Project Runway, but you know
what l mean.

315
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,288
Matty.. Yeah it's true, l mean, l did get into
Lost because of you.

316
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:29,318
Nick.. Yeah.

00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:42,298
Nick.. Yeah, the...cyborg.

322
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,930

323
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,160
Nick.. Yeah.

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,980

327
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,250
Bracey.. l kinda just wrote it last week.

328
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,079
Nick.. Yo.

329
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:05,220

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,348

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,769
Matty.. Thank you.

334
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,259
Matty.. We put our powers combined...

335
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,519
Matty.....we'll be a totally suave looking
dude.

336
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,568
Girl.. Totally would. Lose the shoes
though.

337
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:14,759
Matty.. Whoa.

338
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,690
Girl.. Just kidding.

339
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:21,170
Matty.. l was admiring this picture before.
l thought the guy was throwing up blood

340
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,740
Matty.. but apparently it's fire. But if you go
over here it looks like it's dripping blood.

341
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,848
Girl.. Oh...

342
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,230
Matty.. l wonder who goes about that. Is it
sorrt of like some guy who owns the place

343
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:34,880
Matty.. has his friends decorate it or is it
just people do it and then...

344
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:37,750
Girl.. So l recently starrted Netti-Potting...

345
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,180
Matty.. l think you're too caught up in the
content, you know?

346
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,278
Matty.. l mean like eveybody that people
think did totally original stuff was just
ripping on someone else. You know?

347
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:08,778
Nick.. That's true.

348
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,848
Matty.. l mean Kurrt Cobain said when he
made ''Smells Like Teen Spirit''

349
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:15,019
Matty.. He was basically tying to make a
really good Pixies song.

350
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,259
Nick.. Right, yeah. Totally. l never heard
that but l can see that.

351
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:23,000
Nick.. l'm sure like when The Pixies were
making their songs they were like

352
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,338
Nick.. ''Oh let's make a really great Talking
Heads song.''

353
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:28,990
Matty.. They had that flyer out for their
bassist and it was like someone that has

354
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,838
Matty.. the influences of Peter Paul & May
and Husker Du. And that's how the bassist
joined the band.

355
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:36,038
Nick.. The Pixies?

356
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:36,650
Matty.. Yeah.

357
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,180
Nick.. That's crazy.  Isn't the bassist the
girl?

358
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,250
Matty.. Uh-huh. Kim Deal.

359
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,118
Nick.. That's crazy.

360
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,819
Bracey.. l don't know a Marty pUppy
what's a Marrty-puppy?

361
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,009
Bracey.. What are you talking about?
Marrty-puppy... l'll make a song called
''Marrty Puppy''...

362
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,769
Bracey.. This sounds like a dog song.

363
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:01,130
Matty.. You ever think about just walking
away from it? Take a break?

364
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,769
Nick.. What am l doing if l take a break
from it? l don't have anyything else that l go
back to when l am not doing this.

365
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:09,400
Nick.. Like, this is my break. So if l take a
break from this...

366
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,298
Bracey.. [singing]...and l'll never see
puppy again.

367
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:22,480
Matty.. l told you, you should stop buying
these shitty lighters and get like a fucking
Zippo, you know?

368
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:25,259
Matty.. Light it off your boot and shit.

369
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,390
Nick.. l might as well get a fucking match.

370
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,858
Matty.. Get the ladies and shit, you know.

371
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:29,879
Nick.. Ah, fuck it.

372
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,690

373
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,930
Matty.. Terrorist! You're a terrorist!

374
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,798
Nick.. Did that thing just explode?

375
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,000
Matty.. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, it did.

376
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,170
Matty.. That's fucked up. What if that like

377
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:02,180
Nick.. God damn it l hate my arrtistic life,

379
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:38,990

00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:54,368
Jane.. It's as hot as it goes.

399
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,480
Matty.. It's as hot as it goes, huh?

400
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,469
Matty.. My dad called me recently.

401
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,690
Jane.. Oh, yeah?

402
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,000
Jane.. How did that go?

403
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,039
Matty.. He wanted to go see, you know the
new Bond movie? But...

404
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:15,129
Matty.....he kind of blew me off the first
time. So, when he wanted to go see it
again, l blew him off and l kind of feel like a
dick about it.

405
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,849
Jane.. Why?

406
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,070
Matty.. l don't know.  l mean, it's kind of like
this old tradition -- l can't find the thing, by
the way, for this.  l'm looking for my thing.

407
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:26,900
Jane.. This is your house.

408
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,480
Jane.. You're not...well, you are a dick, but
you're not being a dick right now.

409
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:35,110
Matty.. You sure?

410
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,730
Jane.. Yes. You're not a dick.

411
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,489
Matty.. Thanks.

412
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,309
Jane.. You're welcome.

413
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,070
Matty.. You should put a little more.

414
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,929
Jane.. No, l put enough. l kept in mind
your spicy thing.

415
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:49,229
Matty.. Just a little bit more.

416
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,719
Jane.. l have this going on over here.

417
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,929
Matty.. That's fine.

418
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,880
Jane.. You could even put it away.

419
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,719
Matty.. Okay. Ohh.

420
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,960
Jane.. Oh my god, you're such an
asshole.

421
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,159
Matty.. What, l like it.

422
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,159
Jane.. Do you want to cook the food?

423
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:08,289
Matty.. Yeah, yeah l do actually.

424
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,590
Jane.. Okay, yeah. Well, you can't.

425
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:14,179
Jane.. And besides...it makes your cum

00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,159
Matty.....what?

427
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,849
Jane.. l said it makes your cum taste
awful, so...

428
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,019
Matty.....my cum tastes awful?

429
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,090
Jane.. It's the spices, it's not...your cum
tastes lovely usually, but not with this.

430
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:32,869
Matty.. Well, l know what not to expect
tonight.

431
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,559
Matty.. We're starrting to have an odd
relationship...
Jane.. You just dug your own grave.

432
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,599
Matty.. My fucking cum tastes funny?

433
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,030
Matty.. l'm gonna take a shit and l'm going
to think about this.

434
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,769
Jane.. That's great.

435
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,289
Nick.. There we go.

436
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,150
Jane.. Yeah, l mean, l'm just here for the
weekend, like, l have class on Monday. So
l'm going back to the grind.

437
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:10,300
Nick.. Oh, that sucks.

438
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,800
Jane.. Yeah. l mean, it's okay. It's nice to
be back in school again doing....

439
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,360
Nick.....something?

440
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,300
Jane.. Yeah, eXactly.

441
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,800
Nick.. Totally, like l wish l was back in
school again cause l don't feel like l'm
doing anyything.

442
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,170
Jane.. Yeah. l mean, it gives you -- it
definitely gives you a sense of purpose.

443
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,469
Nick.. Right. That's what you're paying for.

444
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,980
Jane.. Yeah, eXactly. My thousands of
dollars...

445
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,340
Jane.. But yeah like, l have to pay like over
$700 in textbooks.

446
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Jane.. Where -- l don't have $700 for
textbooks.

447
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,860
Nick.. Right. Because you already gave
them like thousands of dollars...

448
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,460
Jane.. Right, l already gave them my soul,
l signed that away.

449
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,630
Nick.. Yeah, right.

450
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,860
Jane.. It didn't cover textbooks though.

451
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,219
Nick.. That's ridiculous, you're already
paying them to like, spend that time to give
you all that information.

452
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,329
Jane..  l know, it's like...

453
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:55,030
Nick.. The education, that's what you're
paying for.

454
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,300
Jane.. Right, eXactly, it's like, give me the
fucking books,

455
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,210
Jane.....you owe me that, and then l will
Iearn.

456
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,880
Nick.. Yeah.

457
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,570
Jane.. Yeah, it's really backwards.

458
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,480
Nick.. It's ass-backwards.

459
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:10,820
Jane.. It is ass-backwards. But l don't like
to think about that on the weekends. This
is my relaxing time. This is Jane time.

460
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,349
Nick.. This is Jane time, okay.

461
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,590
Jane.. Yes. This is my Jane time.

462
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,170
Nick.. Cool. l guess we're all just a parrt of
Jane time right now.

463
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,190
Jane.. Yes. All of you.

464
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,650
Nick.. Yeah. All two of us.

465
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:22,960
Jane.. Yeah.

466
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,300
Jane.. Matt was telling me about this thing
that you're doing with Bracey, the video
thing...?

467
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,840
Nick.. Oh, l was like, ''l'm doing
something? What am l doing?''

468
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,800
Jane.. l heard. You know, l got the signal.

469
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,880
Nick.. Yeah, totally. The Matt signal. l get
those all the time.

470
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,539
Jane.. Right, yeah.

471
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:43,929
Nick.. He's like, ''l have this song that l
want to put out on YouTube and MySpace
and stuff just to get more stuff out there...''

472
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,110
Nick..  and so he was like, ''Oh, you know,
if you could video...'' So l was like, ''All

Jane.. l mean, l'm sure you're gonna think

476
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,829
Nick.. Hopefully.

477
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:02,500

483
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:24,209
Matty.. Food's ready kids.

484
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,159
Nick.. What the fuck?

485
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,420

Jane.. What are you doing?

493
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:12,000
Matty..  Milk's a base, this stuff'll like cut all
the acidic shit out...

494
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,579
Nick.. That is so nasty.

495
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,909
Matty.. It's not that bad.

496
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,989
Jane.. Okay, you know what? Bear fact..

497
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,179
Nick.. You too now? With the fucking bear

498
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:30,309
Jane.. He was saying it, and now he's got
me saying it. l just... yeah.

499
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,650
Nick.. l did not think that one was gonna
Iast.

500
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,260
Jane.. What is this on?

501
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,280
Matty.. What do you mean?

502
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:46,449
Jane.. Like is this on TV or...?

503
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,920
Matty.. It's on Nick's computer actually.

504
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:52,530
Jane.. Seriously?

505
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,579
Jane.. Nick's computer hooks up to the
TV?

506
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,750
Matty.. Yeah. Nick's the man. With the
plan.

507
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,130
Jane.. So cool.

508
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,199
Jane.. Are you going to draw me my
carrtoon soon?

509
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:09,840
Matty.. Yeah. It's just a work progress,
you know? It's going to take some time.

510
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,500
Jane.. Some time? You do that shit all the
time.

511
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,860
Matty.. Yeah, well, l mean, it's usuallyjust
stupid shit, l can't just will it out of
nowhere...

512
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:24,170
Matty.....when it's something imporrtant,
you know? For you it would be imporrtant.

513
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,119
Jane.. l'm skeptical.

514
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,980
Jane.. Are you mad at me?

515
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,880
Matty.. A little bit.

516
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,929
Jane.. Why?

517
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,530
Matty.. You said my cum tastes funny.

518
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,079
Jane.. Bear fact.

519
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,710
Matty.. Fuck you. Bear fucking fact...

520
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:53,050
Nick.. You guys really got to stop with that
or l'm going to kill myself.

521
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:57,030
Jane.. Aww. ''You guys have to stop doing
that before l kill myself.''

522
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,500
Matty.. Fuck this. We're gonna do a blind
taste test. Nick, l want you to beat off into
a cup and we'll do a Pepsi challenge. See
what she says.

523
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,269
Nick.. Uhh, l kind of already did that, so... l
was waiting for you to ask.

524
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,210
Matty.. Oh, really?

525
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,920
Nick.. Yeah. l mean it's been here for
awhile though...

526
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,699
Nick.....so, you probably have a bit of an
advantage; yours is probably a little bit
more fresh.

527
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,510
Matty.. Let's fucking do this right now.

528
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,500
Jane.. You guys are so fucking gross.
That's disgusting.

529
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,840
Matty.. We've been roommates for a long
time, it's only been a matter of time.

530
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,710
Jane.. l don't even know what that means.

531
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,639
Matty.. It means--

532
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,659
Nick.. --we've been doing these taste tests
for a long time.

533
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,880
Matty.. That's eXactly what it means.

534
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,840
Jane.. That was the one thing l was
hoping it didn't mean.

535
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,019
Jane.. Hey. What are you doing out here?

536
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,530
Nick.. Uhh, l didn't really want to, you
know, smoke in the aparrtment while you
were there.

537
00:42:56,768 --> 00:42:57,379
Jane.. Really?

538
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,518
Nick.. Yeah.

539
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,539
Jane.. That's so sweet.

540
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,329
Nick.. Yeah, l guess. l don't know. Yeah,
that's me.

541
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,469
Jane.. That is you.

542
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,989
Jane.. Can you, like, drink out here? Is
that okay or is it like public consumption or
something?

543
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,599
Nick.. What? What do you mean?

544
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,309
Jane.. l don't know, that sounds stupid, l
don't know. Like, can you do that?

545
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,130
Jane.. What was that?

546
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,710
Nick.. l just got dive-bombed by a moth or
something.

547
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:26,070
Jane.. Monster?

548
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,570
Nick.. Actually that looks like a monster
bee.

549
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:30,980
Nick.. It's night-time, you're not supposed
to be here.

550
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,369
Nick.. Oh my god it's right there.

551
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,710
Jane.. Oh jesus.

552
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,530
Nick.. All right hold on.

553
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:43,179
Jane.. This is really not giving you points
in the masculinity deparrtment right now.

554
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:44,699
Jane.. Don't step on it!

555
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,750
Nick.. Oh, no. l'd rather have it like stab
me.

556
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,480
Jane.. l'm going to go get my drink, l'll be
right back.

557
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,420
Nick.. Sure.

558
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:49,969
Jane.. Okay.

559
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:00,750
Nick.. That was quick.

560
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,070
Jane.. That's much better.

561
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,219
Nick.. Sure.

562
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,179
Jane.. Are my teeth stained?

563
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:13,809
Nick.. Yeah a little bit.

564
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,010
Jane.. Really?

565
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,559
Nick.. Just a little bit, what.  l wasn't gonna
be like ''No.''

566
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:18,510
Jane.. Ugh.

567
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:20,409
Nick..  It's fine.

568
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,679
Jane.. All right, whatever.

569
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,860
Nick.. You're losing teeth points.

570
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:26,909
Jane.. Oh yeah, all right. Fair enough.

571
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,800
Jane.. Maybe just one drag?

572
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,849
Nick.. You can do what you want.

573
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,860
Jane.. l can, l can.
Nick.. l'm not responsible if he catches you
of course.

574
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,050
Jane.. Yeah.

575
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,059
Jane.. That was nice.

576
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:42,869
Nick.. Yeah okay cool.

577
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,500
Jane.. So umm...tell me about this internet
girl.

578
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,230
Nick.. Umm. There's really sadly nothing
to tell, unforrtunately.

579
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:01,460
Jane.. So...is that why you're so down?
Because she hasn't called you?

580
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,800
Nick.. l'm not down, really.

581
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:06,940
Jane.. Come on.

582
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:11,000
Nick.. All right, maybe l'm a little down, l
guess.

583
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,670
Jane.. Do you think l could maybe have...a
cigarette?

584
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:17,829
Nick.. Really?

585
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,380
Nick.. Here you go.
Jane.. Thank you.

586
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,550
Nick.. One of my lighters exploded the
other day. Like seriously.

587
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,550
Jane.. That happens?

588
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,550
Nick.. Yeah, apparently. It just...

589
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,480
Jane.. Oh my god.

590
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,820
Jane.. Thank you.

591
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,340
Nick.. Sure.

592
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,570
Jane.. So wait, you didn't explain it to me...

593
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:36,800
Nick.. What?

594
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:42,590
Jane.. Why are you so down? l don't... l
still don't really understand.  It's about the
girl, it's not about the girl...

595
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:48,980
Nick..  It's not, ugh, it...l'm like creatively-
constipated like all the time.

596
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,690
Jane.. Ugh. Okay, disgusting.

597
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,050
Nick.. What, constipated?

598
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,920
Jane.. Yes. You know l don't like toilet
humor or language or...

599
00:45:58,849 --> 00:45:59,840
Nick.. You're fucking weird.

600
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,039
Jane.. Okay, you know what?

601
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:04,510
Jane.. You're fucking weird.

602
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:06,340
Nick.. l am, l know.

603
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,110
Jane.. Yeah but you know it's just like...

604
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,119
Jane.....l know that things will be fine,
eventually. So if things are going to be fine
Iater...

605
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,019
Jane.....they should be fine now.

606
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:19,400
Nick.. Mmm-hmm.

00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,769
Jane.. Fine later, fine now.

608
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:25,849
Nick.. You get that from somewhere or
something? What is that?

609
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:27,570
Jane.. Umm, l don't know, maybe.

610
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,380

611
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,599

Matty.. You serious?

628
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,449
Nick.. Yeah totally, like they give it to the

629
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:11,469
Nick.. but it's not like shaky-camcorder
type, it's like a real DVD.

[from TV] Male.. You played it for her, you

649
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,510
Nick.. Hey Bracey, it's Nick, what's going
on man?

650
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,018
Nick.. You still want me to do that video
right?

651
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:03,050
Nick.. Okay, cool man, l got a bunch of
ideas for it, it turns out, so.

652
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,889
Nick.. Yeah, yeah, no l did. Why? What's
up?

653
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,079
Nick.. Well, l mean...why does anybody
put music on the internet? So people can
hear it.

654
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:28,030
Nick.. Ummm...you were selling it at the
show, so...you were already disseminating
it to random people

655
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:34,380
Nick.. so it didn't even cross my mind
that... How is that different?

656
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:44,059
Nick.. Oh, well... dude, l mean, it sounded
pretty damn good to me. l had no idea that
you -- that it wasn't a finished product.

657
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:50,909
Nick.. Yeah, l guess l'll talk to you later
man. Later.

658
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:10,469
Nick.. Hey, Eva, it's Nick. It's twenty-to-
five on Thursday and l was just wondering
if you were doing anyything tonight...

659
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,769
Nick.. cause my friend's band, which l told
you about, is playing at this place...

660
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:21,879
Nick.....and of course you're all into new
music and shit so l thought you might like
to come along.

661
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:30,010
Nick.. Umm, l guess, if you get this before
this evening give me a call back and
maybe we can get something together.

662
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,380
Nick.. All right. Hope to hear from you
soon. Bye.

663
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,559
Matty.. It didn't fucking record?

664
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:53,760
Nick.. It's not my fault, l set it. l did
eveyrything l was supposed to do. You
know, technology. It does what it wants.

665
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:57,159
Matty.. Fucking Time Warner.

666
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:59,329
Nick.. Yep. No, well actually we don't have
Time Warner. It's not that.

667
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,289
Matty.. Well, fucking SkyNet, fucking
Cablevision, l don't fucking know...

668
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,329
Nick.. l don't know, l think it may be the
show is just so awesome the DVR couldn't
handle it.

669
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:09,630
Matty.. The show is just so awesome?

670
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:14,639
Matty.. l mean what little piece of
technology knew l wasn't going to be home

671
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:17,809
Matty.. so it sabotaged itself so l couldn't
watch the show?

672
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,440
Matty.. It's the principle of the matter, man,
it's the fucking principle.

673
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,489
Matty.. This is why we should not have
thrown out our fucking VCR.

674
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,909
Matty.. l don't need quality. l just want to
know what happened.

675
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:29,449
Nick.. You don't need quality? You don't
prefer quality?

676
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,789
Matty.. Ah, it's a TV show. It's a TV show.

677
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,260
Nick.. Well l mean, l was going to get it off
the Internet you know with great quality
and no commercials

678
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,869
Nick.. but if you're not into that sorrt of
thing...

679
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,199
Matty.. Well l mean if you're going to do it,
then by all means do it, l'm just saying

680
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:45,199
Matty.. when you need your fix, it doesn't
matter the grade, you just take it.

681
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,469
Nick.. Right. You'll take what you can get,
yeah.

682
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:48,170
Matty.. Fuck.

683
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:48,840
Nick.. Fuck.

684
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,920
Matty.. Fuck. Did you watch it?

00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,059
Nick.. l watched it, yeah.

686
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:52,940
Matty.. Okay. Was it good?

687
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,849
Nick.. It was--

688
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:54,929
Matty.. You know what, don't even -- don't
even tell me. Don't tell me anyything.

689
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,199
Nick.. All right, but l just have to say this
one thing --

690
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,389
Matty.. Don't don't don't...don't tell me
anyything. l don't want to know.

691
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:03,969
Nick.. All right.

692
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:06,679

694
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,829
Matty.. Didn't watch it but l did give it to
him and he was actually really happy about
that.

695
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:15,349
Nick.. Good.

696
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,880

697
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:17,929
Nick.. Excellent.

698
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:18,940
Matty.. Thank you.

699
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,239
Nick.. No problem....what the fuck is this?

700
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,380
Matty.. What the fuck is what?

701
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:25,988
Nick.. On the radio. Fucking... applecury.
l don't believe this.

702
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:28,150
Matty.. Oh. Who's applecury?

703
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,449
Nick.. It's that band l was listening to that
one time where you were like

704
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:33,969
Nick.. ''Oh, who is this?'' and l was like ''Oh
it's applecury, they're so great.''

705
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:37,300
Nick.. l can't fucking believe this. You
know what, l don't even listen to the radio.

706
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:40,429
Matty.. Yeah l was about to ask you about
that, why are we listening to the radio?

707
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:44,500
Nick.. l don't know. l don't have my iPod
with me, l don't know what l did with it.

708
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,900
Nick.. It's under something, somewhere.

709
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,230
Matty.. Fucking machines, man.

710
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,329

711
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,730
Matty.. It's not that bad.

712
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:00,420
Nick.. No, they always take the worst song
on the album and make it the single. l will
never understand that.

713
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,420
Matty.. l mean, l'll just tell people that you
heard them first

714
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,780
Matty.. and you're wicked underground,
and that will garner you a lot of scene
points.

715
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,190
Nick.. All right, great.

716
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,530
Nick.. Just make sure you don't show
them this song.

00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,599
Matty.. Evey time l ty to get out, they pull
me back in. Fredo! Fredo!

790
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:22,900
Eva.. What is that from?

791
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:28,260
Matty.. It's from The Godfathers. It's one
of those moving pictures. You know, like
that sexy one.

792
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:34,239
Bracey.. Two seniors for Sarica Jessica
Parker's ''Sexy Town'' please.

793
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,768
Matty.. l work at a movie theater, and you
ever notice when old people come in

794
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,239
Matty.. theyjust never remember the title
of the movie they want to see?

795
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:42,789
Eva.. Mm-hmm.

796
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:46,179
Matty.. Well, l've kind of whittled it down to
a couple of basic rules.

797
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:51,010
Matty..  First off, if the word ''the'' is in front
of a title, theyjust totally omit it.  Or they
add it if it isn't there.

798
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,900
Matty.. They also do this thing where they
pluralize and de-pluralize movies.

799
00:59:57,989 --> 01:00:00,389
Matty.. So ''Transformers'' ends up
becoming like

800
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:04,400
Matty.. ''Five seniors for 'The Transformer'.''
You know? ''And a pickle.''

801
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:06,929
Bracey.. ''l Transform.''

802
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:07,889
Matty.. ''l Transform.''

803
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:13,539
Matty.. This woman come in once and she
was like ''Give me three seniors for 'Failure
to Launch'.''

804
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:17,610
Matty.. And there's no movie even close to
that title on the marquee.

805
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,780
Matty.. Oh, l fucked it up.

806
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:21,780
Nick.. You said 'Failure to Launch'...

807
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,780
Nick.....and that's what it was.
Matty.. It was 'Failure to Launch'.

808
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,518
Matty.. Yeah. She asked for 'Full Throttle',
l'm sory. But she was like

809
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:30,119
Matty.. ''Yeah give me one for 'Full
Throttle'.'' So she went from 'Failure to
Launch' to 'Full Throttle' somehow.

810
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,610
Matty.. l don't know how.
Eva.. They both have to do with, like,
flying.

811
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,579
Bracey.. Throttling....you like throttling.

812
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,690
Matty.. Dude.

813
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:42,960
Matty.. All right, so give me a title, l'll give
you an eXample. Name a movie.

814
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,989
Eva.. Okay, umm...

815
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:46,609
Eva.....Ghostbusters.

816
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:50,269
Bracey.. Two seniors for... 'The Great
Ghost Bust'.

817
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,670
Eva.. That's breaking the rules. You're not
following the rules.

818
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,849
Matty.. Once you know the rules you can
do whatever you want, you know?

819
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:58,989
Matty.. It's like jazz. You have a foundation
and you just keep going from there.

820
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,340
Bracey.. You feel your way through it.

821
01:01:02,349 --> 01:01:04,260
Eva.. That's awesome. They totally do
that.

822
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,340
Matty.. Yeah it's true.

823
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,530
Eva.. It's like -- what's that thing you say?
It's like a total -- it's like a polar bear fact.

824
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:11,559
Bracey.. That's cute.

825
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,630
Nick.. Shut up.

826
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,699
Nick.. It's Bear Fact.

827
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:18,670
Eva.. Bear fact.

828
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:19,280
Nick.. Yeah.

829
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,550
Nick.. You can't have that joke; that's my
joke. It's not yours.

830
01:01:36,389 --> 01:01:37,409
Bracey.. All right...

831
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,010
Matty.. l think that was myjoke anyway.

832
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,639
Bracey.. l kind of thought it was a
communal thing.

833
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:04,659
Matty.. Hey baby boy.

834
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:10,079
Matty.. Coffee's up if you want it.

Nick.. Yeah, it was pretty long.

Matty.. Yeah. What'd you think of Bracey's
new girlfriend?

01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:04,679
Matty.. Well, come on man, we'll make our
own. We'll call it The Bear Share.

01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:05,880
Nick.. Bear's don't share.

849
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,150
