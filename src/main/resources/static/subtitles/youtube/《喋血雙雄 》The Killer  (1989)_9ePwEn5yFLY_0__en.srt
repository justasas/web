1
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,792
You believe in all this?

2
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,112
l like it because it's quiet in here.

3
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,912
l feel comfortable sitting here.

4
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,832
Why don't you examine the guns?

5
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,908
l trust you.

6
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,831
Each day, I Iinger

7
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,677
This heart wanders day and night

8
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,873
I do so want to find
my destined companion

9
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,913
So that my heart
can stop wandering

10
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,115
I wish for the day that
you wouId suddenIy come

11
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,437
GentIy accepting each other

12
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,195
Letting me know that
the person I'm eyeing

13
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,392
That something has changed

14
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,235
So many expectations,
so many dreams

15
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,478
Because the heart
is worrying about so many things

16
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,318
Even if there wasn't much hope

17
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:09,471
Having hope wouId be enough for me
to Iook forward to the future

18
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,117
Without getting my heartfeIt desire

19
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,350
If I get it, why wouId I not accept it

20
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,072
Don't move!

21
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,669
lt's so cloudy.

22
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,949
- Your cornea has been damaged.
- Will l get better?

23
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,548
Your vision has been impaired,
but there's hope.

24
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,829
- l can't see clearly.
- The cornea can be replaced.

25
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,427
- Don't worry.
- Will l go blind?

26
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,553
Jenny, l'm a policeman. Can you
remember the face of the murderer?

27
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,149
- l don't know... l'm really scared.
- Don't be afraid.

28
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,710
Help! Help!

29
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,033
Help!

30
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,830
Get up!

31
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,959
Die!

32
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,759
Don't touch me.

33
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,269
l've fought them off.
Don't be afraid.

34
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,798
Why don't l drive you home?

35
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,229
Jenny...

36
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,872
How do you know my name?

37
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,955
l listen to you sing every night.

38
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,469
Who are you?

39
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,918
Listening to you sing all the time,
l feel like we've become friends.

40
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,636
l know your eyes
have been damaged,

41
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,193
and l've wanted to help,
but l've never had a chance.

42
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,628
Actually, not everyone
is a bad person in this world.

43
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,955
Will you let me help just this once?

44
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,393
Once l see that you're okay, l'll leave.

45
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,754
Be calm.

46
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,115
Let me go check.

47
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,431
lt's only a cat.

48
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,837
That cat always comes in and
tears up my clothes. lt's a nuisance.

49
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,269
Why did you switch the light off?

50
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,151
You can see?

51
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,834
Just a shadow. lt wasn't as bad last
month. At least l could see contours.

52
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,793
lt's better to leave the light on.
l feel safer.

53
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,759
Where are you?

54
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,439
l was just looking at the scarf.

55
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,278
There's a bloodstain, right?
l can't wash it off.

56
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,832
The man who injured
my eyes left this scarf behind.

57
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,071
l will never forget him
for the rest of my life.

58
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,270
Let me get you a cup of tea.

59
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
- No need.
- No, let me. You've helped me.

60
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,827
Why not listen to some music?

61
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,871
Each day, I Iinger...

62
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,672
This heart wanders day and night

63
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,629
I do so want to find
my destined companion

64
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,311
So that my heart
can stop wandering

65
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:19,194
I wish for the day that
you wouId suddenIy come

66
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,109
GentIy accepting each other...

67
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,312
Letting me know that
the person that I'm eyeing

68
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,115
That something has changed...

69
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,913
So many expectations,
so many dreams...

70
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,513
Little Eagle,
you're too earnest. lt won't work.

71
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,552
One look at you,
and they'll figure out you're a cop.

72
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,033
Smile... smile for me.

73
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,592
No way!
You look like a police inspector.

74
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,670
Chang, stay alert.
This guy is like a mad dog.

75
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,509
Just because he's crazy,
don't you be crazy like him.

76
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,072
Staying alive is important.

77
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,437
Brother Hung,
sorry to keep you waiting for so long.

78
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,196
Who's this?

79
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,993
He's one of my boys.
Say hi to Brother Hung.

80
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,347
Brother Hung.

81
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,118
Pat him down.

82
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,710
Hey, Brother Hung.
You don't have to be that nervous.

83
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,831
This isn't our first transaction.

84
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,278
l think l've seen him
somewhere before.

85
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,627
Here!

86
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,637
Here's HK$ 200 000.

87
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,227
After l've looked at the merchandise,
l'll give you the rest.

88
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,956
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, sir. We're just chatting.

89
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,827
Open the boot for me.

90
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,233
Open the boot!

91
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,189
Quickly!

92
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,753
Open it!

93
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,837
You bastard!
You betrayed me!

94
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,234
Are you a turncoat?

95
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,791
Speak up!

96
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,875
l'm not a traitor!

97
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,913
l'll never be a traitor!

98
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,189
- Then why would a cop show up?
- A misunderstanding!

99
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,196
A misunderstanding!

100
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,992
Brother Hung!
On my life, he's not a traitor!

101
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,269
Don't get in my way!

102
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,515
- Get out of my way!
- Trust me! He's not an undercover cop!

103
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,827
l've seen him at a police station!

104
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,030
Tsang Yeh! Hang in there!

105
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,078
Mad dog...
He's a real mad dog!

106
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,668
Out of my way!

107
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,711
Don't come over here!

108
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,711
Don't move!

109
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,150
You... ass...

110
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,191
Finish your sentence!

111
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,677
lnspector Li, the suspect Wong Hung
was holding a hostage

112
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,596
and the tram was filled
with passengers.

113
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,472
You weren't even sure where
the suspect was, correct?

114
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,918
- Yes.
- On what basis did you fire your gun?

115
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:20,869
lntuition.

116
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,990
Then did you consider
the passengers' safety?

117
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,110
Did you issue a warning before firing?

118
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,150
There wasn't enough time.

119
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,872
The hostage had a heart problem.

120
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,954
Her family complained that
you fired without warning,

121
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,717
so she was literally
frightened to death.

122
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,795
They insist on pursuing the matter.

123
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,071
Ridiculous! How would l have known
that she had a heart problem?

124
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,269
l've been investigating Wong Hung
for six to seven months.

125
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,355
l know that he's seriously
mentally unstable

126
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,959
and has homicidal tendencies.

127
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,158
Would you rather l'd waited until
he killed the hostage before l fired?

128
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,033
The cop that Wong Hung shot
to death - did he deserve to die?!

129
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,798
Who can his family complain to?

130
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,553
Fine.
Write up whatever you want.

131
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,555
People file charges against me on
whichever case l work on anyway.

132
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,432
Take my badge, then!

133
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,958
Catch!

134
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,391
l thought your hand
had healed by now.

135
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,157
lt's hopeless.

136
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,675
No plans to go to physio?

137
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,157
lt's beyond that.

138
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,555
A shooter without
an able hand is like a cripple.

139
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,588
Even if l get back into practice,
it's not my show anymore.

140
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,275
His name is Wong Dung-Yu.

141
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,633
He has contacts with Central
and South American drug lords.

142
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,148
- Why is he a target?
- Why do you want to know so much?

143
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,270
Just do it.

144
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,871
l want HK$ 1 500 000.

145
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,831
lsn't that a bit high?

146
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,233
After this,
you'll never see me again.

147
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,275
Okay. As you're going to be taking
his life, it shouldn't be a problem.

148
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,269
These are not registered
and don't have serial numbers.

149
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,073
Very clean.
The police won't be able to trace them.

150
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,192
The bullets have been altered to
the type that you like.

151
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,075
Easy to pick up,
difficult to put down.

152
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,155
Do you want to change your mind?

153
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,115
Why agree to do it again?

154
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,432
Jenny's cornea is not
transparent at all any more.

155
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,676
lf she doesn't get
a cornea transplant soon,

156
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,118
then she may go blind.

157
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,588
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong,
but unfortunately there aren't any in it.

158
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,836
Even if someone
is willing to donate a cornea,

159
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,348
there's already a waiting list of
several hundred people.

160
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,835
Why don't you try overseas?

161
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,316
CHURCH OF SALVATlON

162
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,834
l have to do something.
l have to go away for a few days.

163
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,554
l'll come back to take you to America
to get your eyes healed.

164
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,033
You have to come back.

165
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,479
l will.

166
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,275
Thanks.

167
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,112
Today is the Dragon Boats Festival.

168
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,276
There will be many important
government officials

169
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,391
attending the ''Painting
The Dragon's Eyes Ceremony.''

170
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,238
The information
that each of you have been given

171
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,395
pertains to the person
that you have to protect.

172
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,350
Everyone,
stay alert and be extra careful.

173
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,788
Even this scum...

174
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,271
needs our protection.

175
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,988
Attention everybody,

176

191
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,751
- Look!
- What?

192
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,798
Cover him up.
Don't alarm the public.

193
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,036
All units! There's been a shooting
on the VlP podium.

194
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,354
Wong Dung-Yu has been killed.

195
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,519
The bullets came from the direction of
the sea. The murderer is nearby.

196
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,234
All units!
Begin searching.

197
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,554
Stop and interrogate
anyone looking suspicious.

198
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,148
- Mr. Wong, just fainted. lt's nothing.
- Good. He just fainted.

199
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,076
Please go on with the show.

200
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,868
Tsang Yeh!

201
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,792
Don't let him get away!

202
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,073
Tsang Yeh!
There's an explosion over there!

203
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,076
Something's going on!

204
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,951
You're right! Let's go!

205
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,434
That's the guy we're after!
Don't let him escape!

206
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,629
Don't move!

207
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,471
Don't be afraid!

208
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,951
You'll be fine.

209
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,307
Don't cry.

210
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,153
- He's down there! Follow him! Quickly!
- Okay!

211
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,029
Do you know of
any hospitals around here?

212
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,755
You think that's
where he's heading?

213
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,951
He's not going to throw
the little girl down the hill.

214
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,752
Nurse,
where's the emergency room?

215
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,757
Come with me. Over here.

216
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,673
What's wrong with the little girl?

217
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,788
She's been shot.

218
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,875
Leave the rest to us then.
Measure her blood pressure.

219
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,273
Prepare for an operation.

220
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,311
We have to help her regain
consciousness as soon as possible.

221
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,192
Ready the ECG heart monitor.

222
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,949
What's the condition?

223
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,228
ls the pulse
and blood pressure normal?

224
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,554
The pulse is very weak and the blood
pressure is on the low side.

225
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,513
Did you see a man carrying
a little girl entering this place?

226
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,756
- They're in the casualty room.
- Keep an eye on the exits.

227
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,359
Sir, what's your relationship to the girl?

228
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,913
How did she get injured?

229
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,791
Sir, where are you going?

230
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,398
What's your name?
l need to register the information.

231
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,672
Where did the man go?

232
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,958
l'm a policeman.
Continue with your work.

233
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,558
Everyone stay calm and carry on.

234
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,514
- lgnore them. Let's save this girl.
- Yes.

235
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,516
Don't bother the doctor.
Lower your gun.

236
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,757
- Let's get out of here!
- Run! Run!

237
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,313
- What's going on?
- Someone fired a gun.

238
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,918
- Where?
- Over there!

239
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,315
Help! Help!

240
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,429
Evacuate everyone first!

241
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,351
l'll call headquarters.

242
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,638
- What have you got?
- Not much, Chief lnspector Dou.

243
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,392
l've seen the suspect
but he escaped.

244
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,114
Don't you always
operate on intuition?

245
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,355
A lot of people want to see me
portrayed in a negative light.

246
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,835
l'm betting on the fact that
l'll win this case, not lose it.

247
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,838
lf we do well,
it benefits both of us.

248
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,952
You're not going to get another
chance this good in your life.

249
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,115
Put on a good show, okay?

250
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,068
Chief lnspector Dou,
l don't know how to perform.

251
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,110
l will try my best
to catch the murderer.

252
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,036
l won't let you down.

253
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,832
When you get promoted,
don't forget us.

254
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,876
Please, draw him as l describe him.
Just try to draw his face.

255
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,637
ln his 30's.

256
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,352
Some crow's feet.

257
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,398
He has a manly air about him.

258
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,989
He's a bit different
from the average assassin.

259
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,073
He's very calm... quite intelligent.

260
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,112
His eyes are very alert.

261
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,192
Full of compassion.

262
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,032
Full of passion.

263
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,956
- Hello.
- It's Ah Jong.

264
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,876
Ah Jong?
Why haven't you left?

265
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,070
l need all the money now.

266
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,556
Bring it over tonight.

267
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,236
Tonight.

268
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,672
Okay.
l'll bring it over tonight.

269
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,748
Mr. Wong, you should have let me
handle Ah Jong today.

270
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,677
You should not have
sent people to kill him.

271
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,030
- What if he reveals my identity?
- He's not that kind of person.

272
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,596
l've not trusted anyone since
l've been in this line of work!

273
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,674
lncluding you!

274
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,675
l am very clear on Triad rules.

275
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,711
l'm his manager.
l'll deal with the situation.

276
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,754
l don't care about the rules,
just the methods.

277
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,677
As his identity has been exposed,
l want him dead.

278
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,031
l'm the boss now. l can play
this game however l want.

279
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,911
Okay, l'll let you deal with him.
But if you can't handle him,

280
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,438
l'll deal with you!

281
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,710
You're on my payroll!

282
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,956
lt may be linked with this old case.

283
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,797
Six months ago,
there was unrest among the Triads.

284
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,673
Wong Dung-Yu's Triad brother, Jeung
Wan, was targeted and assassinated.

285
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,394
At the time, the assassin even injured
the eyes of a female singer.

286
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:26,590
The assassin has still not been found.

287
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,632
What's the name of the singer?

288
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,394
Jenny.

289
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,550
l heard that
she almost lost her sight.

290
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,552
A real shame.

291
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,795
Every shot takes a life.

292
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,149
He's no ordinary assassin.

293
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,710
l hope we're looking for the same man.

294
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:53,391
lf my intuition is correct,
he's not a cold-blooded killer.

295
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,874
Every shot of his takes a life
and he's not cold-blooded?

296
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,628
He risked his life to take that
little girl to hospital to save her life.

297
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,673
lf he shot and injured that singer,

298
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,715
he'll still be in touch with her.

299
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,036
I have not yet shed any tears

300
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:18,627
Happy...

301
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,673
A IeisureIy pace...

302
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,672
That wiII be accompanied by tears

303
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,036
- Ah Jong!
- Miss, you've made a mistake.

304
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,432
Sorry. l can't see very well.
l mistook you for my friend.

305
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,954
That song is very beautiful.
Can you sing it again?

306
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,999
l only want to sing it
for one person.

307
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,632
Ah Jong?

308
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,351
You sing the song
with such feeling.

309
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,438
l feel l'm getting to know your friend
just by listening to the song.

310
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,478
lt's unfortunate
that he's not here right now.

311
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,907
Wherever you are,
he's going to miss you.

312
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,991
Maybe he never left.

313
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,838
Don't you trust me?

314
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,713
Should l?

315
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,432
You're right.

316
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,670
ln our line of work, it's sometimes
difficult to trust even a friend.

317
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,716
Why did someone know
where l was getting off the boat?

318
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,673
When l was driving the getaway car
to the pier, l was followed.

319
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,798
l was careless.

320
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,311
Who wants to kill me?

321
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,793
Why ask?

322
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,074
You know the rules of the game.

323
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,630
Why didn't you run away
when you had a chance?

324
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,918
l hadn't been given my money.

325
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,271
Who wants to kill me?

326
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,030
lf you don't reveal your identity,
he won't try to kill you.

327
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,959
l'll repeat my question.
Who's trying to kill me?!

328
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,115
You're not even sure
if there are any bullets left.

329
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,709
Don't you remember
l always save the last bullet?

330
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,992
l either use it to kill someone
or kill myself.

331
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:40,831
Wong Hoi.

332
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,233
Wong Dung-Yu's nephew.

333
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,197
He wants you dead.

334
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,992
He's the one
who wanted you to kill his uncle.

335
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:22,474
Do you really only
have one bullet left?

336
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,351
Ah Jong!

337
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:38,434
Thank you for saving my life.

338
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,355
Actually, like you,

339
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,275
l've been forced into a situation
where there are no other choices.

340
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,550
l never want to see you again.

341
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,512
lnspector Li.

342
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,989
lnspector Li,
it's not exactly a picnic.

343
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,315
ARTlST: CHAN GU FONG
''FLOAT''

344
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:30,475
lt's his place.

345
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,713
That would be a coincidence.

346
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,274
Get that drawing immediately
and ask the neighbours.

347
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,708
GentIy accepting each other...

348
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,315
Letting me know that
the person I'm eyeing...

349
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,230
That something has changed...

350
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:02,190
So many expectations,
so many dreams

351
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,954
Because the heart is worrying
about so many things

352
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,197
Even if there wasn't much hope

353
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,590
Having hope wouId be enough for me
to Iook forward to the future

354
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,597
Without getting my heartfeIt desire

355
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:32,677
And if I was to get it,
why wouId I not accept it

356
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,951
You were right.
l asked around the neighbours.

357
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,831
He really has...

358
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,353
You losing it or what?

359
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,308
Jenny.

360
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,035
Ah Jong, you're back.

361
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,112
Why aren't you here?

362
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,396
l'm going to get your medicine first.

363
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:27,431
Then l'm going to take you
somewhere else.

364
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:29,311
Why?

365
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,557
Moving to less polluted surroundings
would be better for your eyes.

366
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:33,794
Okay.

367
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,990
lt would be ideal if l could
move close to the sea.

368
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,668
l want to see the sea and sky.
That would be so good.

369
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,192
Why don't you pack first?
l'll be there soon.

370
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,913
l'll wait for you.

371
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,197
Why didn't you run away
when you had a chance

372
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,673
Why

373
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,516
Hey! You're the new garbage man?

374
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:23,914
- Yes, grandma.
- You're so negligent!

375
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:27,315
This is the fire escape route.
You're throwing the trash everywhere.

376
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,635
- Okay, sorry, sorry.
- lf we're trapped by a fire, then what?

377
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,910
You better move it all quickly!

378
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:35,237
l've paid my building
maintenance fees. You're so lazy!

379
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,396
- l'm reporting you to the main office.
- l'm moving it already?

380
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:38,748
You'd better move it all quickly.

381
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,836
You're a mature adult
and you're so lazy.

382
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,076
So dirty! How dare you!

383
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,190
Ah Jong. ls that you?

384
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,438
Yes, Jenny.

385
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:22,308
You brought a friend home?

386
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:26,918
Yeah. He's a friend
from football practice.

387
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:31,717
We've played football since we were
children living in the housing estates.

388
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,670
Yeah. His name is...

389
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,472
Runt, Shrimp Head.

390
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,750
You were called Shrimp Head?

391
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,108
Yeah.

392
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,558
We're so happy
to meet up again.

393
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,237
l'm not that happy.

394
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,998
Why aren't you happy
about seeing your friend?

395
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,155
He gives out negative vibes.

396
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,714
From childhood, he's been following
me around like a vengeful spirit.

397
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,108
l won't be following you around
for much more.

398
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,277
Why don't l pour you two tea?

399
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,195
- No need.
- No need.

400
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,469
l have to.

401
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:58,351
- Be careful not to burn yourself.
- lndeed.

402
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,992
l'm smart, l won't burn myself.

403
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,634
Ah Jong, why don't you entertain
Runt, and take a seat.

404
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:07,396
Take a seat, Runt.

405
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,079
Okay, Shrimp Head.

406
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:13,556
Grandma, do you watch everyone
throw out the trash every day?

407
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,637
No, someone gave me
HK$ 1 000 to chat with you.

408
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,399
Hey, sir,
we haven't finished chatting yet!

409
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:21,431
Hey! Let's chat some more
before you leave!

410
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,357
- You're going to lose this match.
- Really?

411
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,878
Let's see who's going to lose.

412
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,309
You're the one who misses
every time you're in front of the goal.

413
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,590
You're wrong.
l have the best striker.

414
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:34,911
What a pity that your striker is lame.

415
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,952
Were you always this earnest?

416
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,469
Yes.

417
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,396
l don't take things lightly.

418
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:43,918
Same with me.

419
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,429
That's why l feel
we're alike in some ways.

420
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,835
Are you trying to say that we're
as good as each other at football?

421
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,871
- That's unlikely.
- Likely.

422
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,872
You two are really getting along well.
Have a cup of tea first.

423
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,632
- Jenny, be careful with the tea.
- Watch you don't burn yourself.

424
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:06,756
Jenny, entertain Runt first.

425
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:08,638
Have a cup of tea, Runt.

426
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,318
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

427
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,476
ls that another pal
who's dropped by?

428
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,068
No...

429
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,673
The garbage lady came by.

430
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,278
l don't have any trash
to throw away.

431
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,789
She said the drain is blocked.
She needs to help you unblock it.

432
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,717
The drain is on the balcony, grandma.

433
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,072
Runt, your voice is very familiar.
Where have l heard it before?

434
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:31,996
l've seen you at the bar.

435
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:34,474
You weren't willing to sing
the song l really liked.

436
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,875
Oh, you're Mr. Li.
What a coincidence!

437
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,467
Yeah, Runt. Why don't you
tell Jenny a bit more about yourself.

438
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,157
- l have to go to the toilet.
- l need to go too.

439
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,431
Wait, l'll lead the way.
There's a toilet in my bedroom too.

440
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,674
Wow, there's a big rat!

441
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,358
- Again?
- lt's gone into the kitchen.

442
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,878
Why don't l catch it for you?

443
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,356
Hey, it's me!

444
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,878
Don't shoot!

445
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,394
You-know-who's down there
pointing a gun at me!

446
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,871
What's happening?

447
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,351
Where's Ah Jong?

448
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,840
l know that you're both lying to me.

449
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,153
Speak up.

450
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,791
Tell me who you are.

451
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,789
l'm a police detective.

452
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,793
Ah Jong is an assassin.
He's killed someone.

453
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,355
We've been after him for some time.

454
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,558
l don't believe you!

455
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,509
- Jenny, listen to me.
- l won't listen to you!

456
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:26,393
Jenny, don't be like this.

457
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,235
Jenny, calm down. Listen to me.

458
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,398
Sit down first.

459
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,711
The guy whose shot injured your
eyes six months ago was Ah Jong.

460
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,672
Now the Triads
want to silence him.

461
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,278
l don't believe you!

462
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:55,957
The law sometimes cannot
accommodate human folly.

463
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,389
l hope that you will cooperate with us
and act as bait to lure him out.

464
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,188
Jenny...

465
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,159
l'm on your side.

466
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,070
lf Ah Jong is in our custody,
at least it will be to his benefit.

467
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:14,271
lt's better than
being killed by the Triads.

468
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,075
I don't care how much
it costs, but I want him dead.

469
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:25,667
He exposed his identity,
and broke the rules.

470
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,950
l want him lying dead
in front of my feet!

471
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,150
First transfer USD 1 00 000
into my account.

472
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,191
After the job,
pay in another USD 200 000.

473
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:35,877
lf l don't see
the bank receipt from you,

474
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,708
even if someone were to hold a gun to
your head now, l won't move a finger.

475
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,273
Go to the bank now
and take out USD 1 00 000.

476
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,389
- Yes.
- Mr. Wong.

477
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:44,510
You're finished. You still
have the guts to come see me?

478
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,188
Give him the money.

479
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,629
He won't give up until he gets
his hands on his money.

480
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,152
Or what?
He'll shoot me?

481
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,475
l've got brothers
all over the streets. We'll see!

482
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,470
As a Triad member,
trustworthiness is also important.

483
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,750
Don't mention him anymore,
unless you want to beg before me!

484
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,628
Why can't you see this as a chance
for me to fix things with a friend?

485
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,028
That way things will be sorted out
between us too.

486
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,148
Brother Hoi,

487
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,393
l'll kneel down...

488
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,510
if it makes you happy.

489
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:27,992
You're a real pain in the ass!

490
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,838
lf l didn't still consider you
a Triad elder, l'd beat you senseless!

491
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,713
What's the big deal about him?
He's just an insignificant nobody!

492
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,196
l really don't understand!
Why are you always on his side?

493
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,151
He's a complicated man.

494
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:41,391
Don't mention him again!

495
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:25,951
Something's happened! Hurry up!

496
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,518
Kill him!

497
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:52,596
Kill him!

498
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:53,708
Don't let him escape!

499
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,273
Big Brother, you're injured!
Stay back!

500
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,276
Kill him!

501
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,550
We can handle this! Get back!
lt's too dangerous!

502
00:58:58,679 --> 00:58:59,589
Kill him!

503
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,197
lf you still consider me a friend,
then blow me away with one shot!

504
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,789
l don't want to see a friend

505
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,275
kneeling in front of someone else
begging money for me!

506
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,232
l may not be
very involved these days,

507
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,191
but l always come through
when l've promised a friend!

508
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,637
lf l could kill you with one bullet,

509
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,432
then l wouldn't have to kneel in front
of people begging for your money!

510
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,596
Of course l feel ashamed of myself!

511
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:23,911
The world has changed.

512
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,077
You and l are no longer suited
to the Triad lifestyle,

513
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,554
because we treasure
the past too much.

514
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,711
Maybe we're the lucky ones.

515
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,388
When the time comes to die,

516
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,351
l don't want to leave
without even one friend.

517
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:50,872
My regret is that l owe you one.

518
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,075
One can't think
like that with friends.

519
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:06,391
Otherwise,
what are friends for?

520
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:09,871
Right?

521
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,596
- Ah Jong.
- Thanks.

522
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,836
Jenny keeps hoping that
she'll see the sea and sky again.

523
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,471
You've done so much for her.

524
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,438
l wonder how she feels about you.

525
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,150
Hello.

526
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,512
Ah Jong, why did you leave so
suddenly and leave me all to myself?

527
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,155
l'm very sorry.
Something came up.

528
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,351
We have to Ieave tonight.

529
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:22,389
Tonight?

530
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,309
Dr. Ho contacted me and told me
there's a pair of corneas in Singapore

531
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,588
that Iots of peopIe
want to get hoId of.

532
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:29,232
He's aIready reserved it for me,

533
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,590
and said that it wouId be best
for me to Ieave tonight.

534
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,472
Very well. l'll go with you.

535
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,914
l've booked tickets for tonight.
l'll wait for you at the airport.

536
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,757
You have to come tonight.

537
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,677
Okay. Bye.

538
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,637
Do you think he'll come?

539
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,512
Are you going to go?

540
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,592
She's never lied to me.

541
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,996
- What's up?
- Let's check out that way. Let's go.

542
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:20,431
We must keep an eye on
all exits and corridors.

543
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:22,351
Stay alert, everyone.

544
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:26,230
lt's all set up,
unless he's not coming.

545
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,077
lf he comes,
he won't be able to escape.

546
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:56,913
Chairman, please don't worry when
you're away. Just leave it up to us.

547
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,070
lf something happens,
we will contact you.

548
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,028
Thank you for seeing me off.

549
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:07,197
Please have a good journey!

550
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:12,558
While l'm away, l'll leave
the company in your capable hands.

551
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,590
Yes. We understand.

552
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,918
Take care!

553
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,552
Ah Jong!

554
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:23,550
Don't come! Ah Jong, run away!

555
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:24,714
What's wrong with you?

556
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:29,397
- Ah Jong! Ah Jong!
- Take care and have a safe journey!

557
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:31,909
There're many policemen here.
Don't come!

558
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,635
Ah Jong! Where are you?

559
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,429
The police want to arrest you.

560
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:38,548
Don't come!

561
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:39,556
Go quickly!

562
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,594
Ah Jong! lf you're here, run away
quickly! Don't let them catch you!

563
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,949
- Miss, are you waiting for someone?
- Ah Jong! Run away! Quickly!

564
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,751
The police want to arrest you!

565
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,193
Ah Jong!
Don't let them catch you!

566
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,268
Ah Jong! Don't let them catch you!

567
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,150
Run away!

568
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,112
Ah Jong! Run away!

569
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:26,478
lt's me.

570
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,108
Don't move!

571
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:28,955
Don't move!

572
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,673
Stand up!

573
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,548
Don't move! Don't move!

574
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,516
Let's go now.

575
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,197
What's up, cop?
ls it a crime to talk to a girl?

576
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,388
Arrest him!

577
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,114
Apologies! Apologies!
Go and search the area!

578
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:16,632
What were you doing
at the airport?

579
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:17,913
Checking out girls!

580
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:19,438
What's your profession?

581
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:24,269
l'm a talent scout for a film company.

582
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,836
- Why did you fight my officers?
- l was drunk.

583
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,554
Drunk?
Stand up and take a few steps!

584
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:46,873
Where's your friend?

585
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,751
l don't have friends.

586
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:52,949
l know that you people
live your life by a code of honour.

587
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:54,990
l also want a friend like you.

588
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,795
lf you tell me,
then you'll be helping him.

589
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,239
Not hindering him.

590
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,639
l also want to help him resolve
his difficult situation.

591
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,878
Which would also solve my problem.

592
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,150
You'll have to sort out
your own problems.

593
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,193
lf the person you're speaking of
really doesn't have any friends,

594
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:19,710
then he would also resolve
the situation himself.

595
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,550
Li Ying,

596
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,036
from this moment onwards, Chan Bok
Man will be in charge of your case.

597
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,117
You're transferred to another case.

598
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,309
l want to know why?

599
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,510
l don't have confidence in you!

600
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:39,515
Your emotions are getting in the way of
logic. You won't succeed. You'll fail.

601
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:44,159
Chief lnspector Dou,
you've never understood me.

602
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,393
Yes, l misunderstood you.
That's why l'm replacing you.

603
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,394
- l won't give up!
- How dare you!

604
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:55,827
Ah Tsang!

605
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,394
Help lnspector Chan finish up.

606
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,268
Release Fung immediately and then
follow him around 24 hours a day

607
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,197
until you get some dirt on him.

608
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:08,427
Do you understand?

609
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,228
BE FlLLED WlTH HONOUR

610
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,752
Would you kill people again?

611
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,994
At first, l thought l would only kill
bad people, and not good people.

612
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:49,957
But it's not that easy.

613
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:54,835
l don't want to kill anyone again.
l hope l can achieve that.

614
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:12,868
l was followed.
The cops and Wong Hoi's guys.

615
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,274
But l managed to lose them.

616
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,954
Wong Hoi hired a gang of experts
to deal with you.

617
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,918
You'll be okay. There are enough guns
here for you to deal with them.

618
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,234
Where are you going?

619
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,756
l'm going to get your money back.

620
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,234
Wait for me at the church tonight.

621
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,391
You're going by yourself?

622
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,398
lt's all right.
lt's what l should do.

623
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:48,756
l'm still a Triad elder.
They still have to show me respect.

624
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:50,588
Brother Sei.

625
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:53,679
lf it's not possible, let it go.

626
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,234
l don't want to lose a friend like you.

627
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,319
Tsang Yeh.

628
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,113
Tsang Yeh.

629
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:21,474
l...

630
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,636
l followed him to...

631
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,591
no. 6 Horizon Drive.

632
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,029
lt's very easy to find.

633
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:31,317
- l'll find it.
- Horizon Drive...

634
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,714
l'll find it.

635
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,114
l'll definitely find the place.
Don't worry.

636
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,588
Little Ying...

637
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,869
lt's not about winning or losing.

638
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,556
No-one can win against everyone.

639
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:47,708
Sometimes losing
doesn't mean that you failed.

640
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,109
Tsang Yeh...

641
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,675
Tsang Yeh!

642
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:17,469
Ah Ying! Did he tell you
where the assassin was?

643
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,632
Go ask Tsang Yeh yourself!

644
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,079
Ah Jong!

645
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:45,592
What are you doing?

646
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,836
Ah Jong,
why is it so dark?

647
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,791
lt looks like
it's going to rain today.

648
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,074
Don't worry.
Your eyes are fine.

649
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:01,429
- Are we leaving now?
- Yes.

650
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,033
Stand still.

651
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:07,878
Who is it?

652
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,150
- lt's Runt.
- Why is he here?

653
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,551
l guess he's seeing us off.

654
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:18,307
Why haven't you shot me?

655
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:21,556
l'm a policeman. l won't shoot
someone in the back.

656
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,911
- Just like my profession.
- They're nothing like each other!

657
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,155
l uphold the law,
you violate it!

658
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:30,197
lf l can't arrest you today,

659
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,549
how am l supposed to
avenge with my dead friend?

660
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,076
l'm sorry.
l won't let you arrest me.

661
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:46,114
lf you need to avenge your pal,
why don't you just shoot me dead?

662
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:48,951
Don't force me to fire on you!

663
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,307
l can't believe
you actually shot me.

664
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,438
l don't miss an opportunity.

665
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,551
You won't have many more.

666
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,874
You won't win every time.

667
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:14,434
Where are you?

668
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,675
Ah Jong?

669
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,918
Runt... where is Runt?

670
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,439
He's just in front of us.

671
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,552
Don't arrest him.

672
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,034
He promised me
he won't kill anyone else again.

673
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,229
- Put down the gun first.
- Put down the gun.

674
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:30,827
l won't let go of the gun
unless he lets us leave!

675
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,434
l beg you! Let us go!
l won't let you arrest him!

676
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:39,554
Did l hit him? ls he dead?

677
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:41,314
l didn't mean it!

678
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,871
- l really didn't want to shoot him!
- He's fine.

679
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,438
l didn't mean it!

680
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,952
Runt isn't dead.

681
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,952
Don't be afraid! Stay calm!

682
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,789
- Ah Jong! Ah Jong!
- Don't go outside!

683
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,235
lf you want to arrest me,
shoot us out of here first!

684
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:35,236
Let's discuss this
after we get Jenny out safely!

685
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,113
My car is outside.

686
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,709
Let's go!

687
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,309
l won't let you take me back
to the police station.

688
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,279
Put your gun down.

689
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,159
l know you won't kill a cop.

690
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:53,474
Thanks.

691
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,109
You could have shot me dead
with one bullet just now.

692
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,800
l won't casually kill my enemy
until l understand him.

693
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:03,032
Do you understand me?

694
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,919
Sometimes fate is a trickster.

695
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:10,918
Who would have guessed that
the person who understands me...

696
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:13,552
...is a cop.

697
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,796
Actually you could give up.

698
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,953
l've considered that,

699
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:21,998
but if l promise to do something,
then l have to do it.

700
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:23,997
l wish l could be as carefree.

701
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:27,668
Sometimes l really want to do
something, but l can't.

702
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:32,994
l believe in justice,
but no-one believes in me.

703
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:35,674
Good people
are usually misunderstood.

704
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,234
You really don't look like a cop.

705
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,672
You don't look like an assassin either.

706
01:22:46,039 --> 01:22:48,634
l'm sorry.
l've even dragged you into all this.

707
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,318
l just want to know
who's behind all this.

708
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:53,954
Every profession has its rules.
l can't tell you that.

709
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:57,076
l knew you wouldn't say anything.

710
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,039
But the road
you're taking is a long one.

711
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:03,430
You must always take care.

712
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,630
l still have to arrest you.

713
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,436
Come on.

714
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,478
We'll stay here for the night.
When my friend brings me the cash,

715
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,238
we'll fly off to America tomorrow.

716
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:35,395
l wonder if those people
will find us here.

717
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,109
They won't.

718
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,514
They won't find their way here.
Don't worry.

719
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,358
How come there isn't any light?

720
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,391
l can't see anything.

721
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,800
Ah Jong,
quickly turn on the lights.

722
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,117
Why don't you turn on the lights?

723
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:04,958
Ah Jong.

724
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:13,798
Ah Jong, turn on the lights.

725
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,070
l think there's a temporary
power failure.

726
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:24,990
ls your friend
really going to show up?

727
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:28,679
He will.

728
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,033
He will definitely show up.

729
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,432
Big Brother, the money for Paul
has already been prepared.

730
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:41,269
l wonder
if he can deal with Ah Jong?

731
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:55,514
Big Brother. Brother Fung is here.

732
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,029
What if he betrays you again?

733
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,158
l will still consider him a friend.
After all, he's helped me before.

734
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,149
- l need the money.
- Where's Ah Jong?

735
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:18,597
There are few people
who can be considered true friends.

736
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,747
They exist.
They're just rare.

737
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,520
Throw down your weapons.
Everyone, throw down your weapons!

738
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,079
lsn't your hand damaged?

739
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:49,157
lt's damaged, but l still have
some of the pro left in me.

740
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,356
You profession only leads to death.

741
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:52,707
Why continue to stay in it?

742
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,512
Teach me
how to retrace my steps then.

743
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,672
Where's my money?

744
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,712
Ah Sing!

745
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:14,069
You're really stupid!

746
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:15,917
You should have
shot me in the head!

747
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:17,028
You're right.

748
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,110
l haven't held a gun in so long.
l'm less competent now.

749
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,314
lf l had a chance,
l'd like to restart my life.

750
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,589
But it's a shame...

751
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:35,672
l want that money.

752
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,550
Where's Ah Jong?

753
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:39,189
You should give him that money.

754
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,757
That's the meaning of
ethics and honour.

755
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:47,155
Ridiculous!

756
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,556
Are ethics and honour
valid in your profession?

757
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,677
The world's changed now.

758
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:58,154
Very few people believe.

759
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:02,949
Uncle,

760
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:04,354
if it's this tough being human,

761
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:06,197
it's better for you to be a dog.

762
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:12,430
Actually we're very similar.

763
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,949
We both make a living with a gun.

764
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,391
But how we use
a gun is different.

765
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,389
Right?

766
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:26,792
lf l'm a dog,
l still have my dignity.

767
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,109
lf you won't tell me
where Ah Jong is,

768
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:39,036
you won't even get
the chance to be a dog!

769
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:41,197
Throw him in the garbage!

770
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:02,874
Get me the money!

771
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,796
Do you still have bullets?

772
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,715
Try me.

773
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:10,076
Those of us in our profession

774
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:13,430
usually save the last bullet
to kill another or ourselves.

775
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:28,594
Quickly!

776
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:32,474
Turn around!

777
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,317
l can't believe l was stupid
enough to miscount!

778
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:49,994
Follow him! Quickly!

779
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,916
l want you to do me a favour.

780
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,796
lf l'm killed
but my eyes aren't injured,

781
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,076
get me to a hospital
to save my corneas for Jenny.

782
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,953
lf you can't even do that,

783
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,274
then give her the money
and get her on the plane.

784
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,829
Are there really
no other choices?

785
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,596
The only time in my life
l've done the right thing...

786
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:27,792
...is this time.

787
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:30,356
Are you going to help me?

788
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:04,234
What is it?

789
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:08,840
- Did someone arrive?
- Come over here.

790
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,272
Brother Sei.

791
01:30:26,119 --> 01:30:27,872
Your money...

792
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:31,157
l got the money back for you.

793
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:39,630
To be able to settle matters with
a friend is the most important thing.

794
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,193
Brother Sei.

795
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:43,274
Thank you for this.

796
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,474
They say that l'm a dog.

797
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:07,470
l don't even know
if l'm a man or a dog.

798
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:09,268
Brother Sei.

799
01:31:09,399 --> 01:31:10,719
They're not qualified to criticise you.

800
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:13,837
Brother Sei!

801
01:31:18,359 --> 01:31:19,189
Brother Sei!

802
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,752
Brother Sei...

803
01:31:32,359 --> 01:31:34,350
Am l a dog?

804
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,427
No.

805
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:38,719
You're not a dog,

806
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,959
you're a man.

807
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:44,550
You and l are
no longer suited to the Triad world.

808
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,315
l don't want to be like a dog,
and be shot to death by them.

809
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:56,671
l'm dying,
and l don't even have a bullet.

810
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:00,878
You do.

811
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,551
l do.

812
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,034
- Ah Jong.
- Stay here and don't move.

813
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,512
Don't leave me.

814
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:49,759
Hey! What are you planning?

815
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:52,076
Shoot my way out!

816
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:53,474
Don't kill more people!

817
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,670
Throw down your gun
and come with me!

818
01:32:56,199 --> 01:32:57,552
Throw down my gun?

819
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,112
l've had to kill a friend l've known
for more than a decade with one shot,

820
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,756
and you're asking me
to throw down my gun?

821
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,597
When my partner died,
l wanted to shoot you too!

822
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,909
But now l don't want you to die.

823
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,912
Take Jenny and get out of here!

824
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,069
Run away?

825
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,993
Even if l run to the ends of the earth,
they'll still follow me!

826
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:23,189
l can't run away, so l'll take a risk!

827
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,314
Go outside and try telling them
that you're a cop!

828
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,114
Let's see if they drop
their weapons!

829
01:33:47,319 --> 01:33:48,229
Ah Jong!

830
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,074
Ah Jong!

831
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:12,956
Runt!

832
01:34:13,319 --> 01:34:14,639
Thank you, Shrimp Head!

833
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,150
Runt, l owe you.

834
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:36,479
Don't talk about owing favours.

835
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,068
One can never fully repay favours
done out of compassion. Good luck!

836
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,748
Jenny, don't run!

837
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,193
Stay there! Don't move!

838
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:26,671
Runt!

839
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,994
Give me a gun!

840
01:37:28,119 --> 01:37:29,916
Shrimp Head! Catch!

841
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,238
Are you an accurate shoot?

842
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:56,429
How else could l be a cop?

843
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,235
We've been friends for so long,
and l still don't know your real name.

844
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,114
Do you need to know?

845
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:37,549
Well, something tells me
that after all this is settled,

846
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,238
if you're not dead,
you'll have escaped.

847
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,590
lt'll be good to be able to remember
that l once had such a friend.

848
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,074
Then do you want me
to die or escape?

849
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:48,788
lf fate hasn't already decided,
then l don't want either.

850
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:52,235
That shows you care about me.

851
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,319
Didn't you make up
my nickname Shrimp Head?

852
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,475
Who is it?

853
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:53,838
Please do not hurt her!

854
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:55,676
Walk!

855
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:56,751
Walk!

856
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,274
Throw down your weapon!

857
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:16,832
l told you to
throw down your weapon!

858
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,712
Will you or won't you,
you bastard!

859
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:19,954
Ah Jong!

860
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:24,120
Ah Jong!
Where are you, Ah Jong?

861
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,273
You don't have to be afraid!

862
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,518
l'm just in front of you!

863
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:31,030
You had better
put down your weapon!

864
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:34,713
Jenny, don't struggle!

865
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,318

No way!

872

And if l don't let her go?

873
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,552
Put down your weapons!

874
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:17,795
Runt,

875
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:22,988
l hope you're able to pull off
what you promised me.

876
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:27,514
No problem.

877
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,877
Don't forget that you
still have a friend to back you up.

878
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,233
Throw down your weapons!

879
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:45,554

Shrimp Head!

882
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,999
Shrimp Head!

883
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,029

01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,272
Ah Jong!

01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,392
You don't look like a cop.

893
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,074
You don't look like
an assassin either.

894
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,512
l believe in justice.

895
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,796
But no-one believes in me.

896
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:53,629
Good people are usually
misunderstood.

897
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:56,348
Arrest him!

898
01:44:56,479 --> 01:44:57,309

Shrimp Head...

903
01:45:28,359 --> 01:45:30,270
Shrimp Head...

904
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,989
Shrimp Head...
