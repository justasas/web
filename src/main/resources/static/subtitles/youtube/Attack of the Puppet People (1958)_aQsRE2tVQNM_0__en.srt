be patient you'll be with you in a

367
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:43,220
minute this pressure will revive him in

368
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,220
no time

369
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:23,039
ah you don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I enjoy these</font>

370
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:26,250
little reunions you funny little people

371
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:30,539
I wonder why it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you always hate me so</font>

and it's never dull you sweep away the

379
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:56,460
long boring hours and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> jars and when</font>

380
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,279
I take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to wake you it's it's</font>

381
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:03,420
only to have fun to enjoy some new treat

382
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,759
I thought up for you don't you see how

383
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,800
fortunate you are you have nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

384
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,970
all the rest of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> little lives that</font>

385
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:15,750
be happy that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think change</font>

386
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,610
back away we were I<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you better the</font>

387
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:23,250
way you are are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

388
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:26,009
time always would you really like to

389
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,710
know it's my secret but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

390
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:31,549
you'll give me away it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

391
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,549
principle really

392
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,418
notice how this slide projector throws a

393
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:53,259
visual image I can make it any size i

394
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:57,038
choose i push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> closer to the wall the</font>

395
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:59,710
picture becomes smaller being of an

396
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,148
inquiring mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked myself one day if</font>

397
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,090
I couldn't do the same with living

398
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:06,308
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reasoned that if I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font>

399
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:08,648
them through a device similar in

400
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:11,050
principle to this slide projector that I

401
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:13,059
would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to project these living</font>

402
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:19,169
things to any size<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

403
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:19,168
choose this is the answer I found

404
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,719
Oh

405
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:46,849
yeah Tommy Tommy Tommy Tommy you project

406
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:50,809
a complex molecular structure such as a

407
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:53,299
man or say a cat it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only necessary to</font>

408
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:56,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">change him into energy first much as the</font>

409
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,730
light<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that slide projector I soon</font>

410
00:34:56,269 --> 00:35:01,519
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the most practical way of</font>

411
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,559
causing this chain was to break down

412
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:07,369
molecular<font color="#CCCCCC"> structure by means of</font>

413
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:10,219
high-frequency vibration now with this

414
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:17,839
tuning fork I will set up a sonic

415
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:20,089
vibration just as the glass

416
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,030
disintegrated to the resonant frequency

417
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,740
sent out by this tuning fork so with a

418
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">living thing disintegrate to its</font>

419
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:29,809
resonant frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course it's a much</font>

420
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:39,049
higher frequency oh there you are tummy

421
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:42,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh now watch this make you take</font>

422
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,490
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

423
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:05,098
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

424
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:36,528
you remember Tommy miss Reynolds he

425
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">always liked you take him being so small</font>

426
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:42,619
he may feel strange at first met him I

427
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:45,019
must go and get some of the other little

428
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:47,528
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who live with me I want them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>
