00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:49,358
this we have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative but to let</font>

rely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the colors to determine the</font>

250
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,429
results of these experiments as you know

251
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:02,199
we can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and white</font>

260

great things especially as you have such

261
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,249
a close relationship with the general HQ

262
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:42,159
that's good you should sacrifice

263
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:51,219

269
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:05,648

it

369
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:50,420
a careful of contamination the last

00:43:52,099 --> 00:44:14,329
inject those people first yes sir let's

373
00:43:54,619 --> 00:44:16,519
go eat sir according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

374
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,289
test results it'll be quite difficult to

<font color="#E5E5E5">produce a strain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bubonic plague that</font>

376

is more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 times as infectious as</font>

377

results of the last few tests mm-hmm sir

380
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:33,650
I heard that the Germans are performing

381
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,030
similar kinds of tests using the Jews as

382
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:39,139
subjects and they've achieved good

383
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:41,150
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> so can't we approach them before</font>

384
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:42,469
the war dr. Ishi collected data on this

385
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,900
project in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

386
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:46,819
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him the german research and</font>

387
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,039
experiments in this area are far behind

388

our own compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them our equipment</font>

389

00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they've achieved so far may not be</font>

391
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,280
of any use to us at all come on now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

392
00:44:56,449 --> 00:45:00,349
don't feel discouraged you keep up the

393
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,360
good work and report to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me at once when</font>

394
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:07,400
the experiments are completed yes sir

395
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:09,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">sir I heard that lieutenant colonel na</font>

396

kotomi died in action on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the southern</font>

397
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:15,560
front is that right hmm it's true dr.

398
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:19,429
Ishi really shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have gone so far</font>

399
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,619
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did hmm I suggest we keep out of</font>

400
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:24,319
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us you just</font>

401
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:26,539
concentrate on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> career you know</font>

402
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,460
the medical department is awaiting your

return the future of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Medicine in Japan</font>

404
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,320
is in the hands of people like you

405
00:45:45,440 --> 00:46:09,858
so in other words the success of the 731

406
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,510
decides the survival of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Empire so</font>

407
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:14,750
today we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Harbor no more</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Kwantung army other than relying on our</font>

bacterial warfare has no other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of</font>

411
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:22,099
winning the war I've always believed

412
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:23,690
that chemical and biological weapons are

413
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:25,880
a far more<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective way of waging war</font>

414
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:29,690
than bombs and guns and right now we

415
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:31,190
must regroup and mobilize our forces so

416
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,108
gentlemen I must entreat you to work

417
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,030
doubly hard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order that we can win</font>

418

final victory we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get ourselves</font>

419

if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any questions ah please go</font>

422
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,179
ahead we have managed to successfully

423
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,920
produce a mutated plague bacteria which

424
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:57,078
is 60 times more lethal than the norm

425
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,030
the amount we have cultivated according

426
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,970
to our calculations sir is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Varens enough</font>

427
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,680

about 1 billion fleas if 1 billion of

<font color="#E5E5E5">both cities have been completely</font>

01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:33,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">High Command</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to retreat but I personally</font>

659
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the work of 731 squadron</font>

660
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:37,948
involves highly classified information

661
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:41,730
so now I'm requesting the following from

662
01:21:37,948 --> 01:21:43,710
you firstly we must exterminate all

663
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:45,419

compound must be destroyed nothing is to

665
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:50,699
remain the engineers will be in charge

666
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:52,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this job second all buildings must be</font>

667
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:55,678
razed to the ground I want nothing left

668
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:57,329
third collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> all data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and documents I</font>

669
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:01,679
want them all destroyed at once nothing

670
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:04,800
is to remain at all fourth<font color="#E5E5E5"> the youth</font>

671
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:08,520
core retreat stat Anwar fifth all units

672
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:10,409
commit suicide also families and

673
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:15,000
dependents will commit suicide as well

674
01:22:10,409 --> 01:22:16,590
in other words everything must be

675
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,189
destroyed no evidence must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

676
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:22,500
behind dr. the squadron consists of some

677
01:22:20,189 --> 01:22:24,779
very highly qualified people it seems

678
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">such a waste to order them to die really</font>

679
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:28,409
there's no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for such meaningless</font>

680
01:22:26,189 --> 01:22:30,238
sacrifices I'm fully aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

681
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:33,269
general but we have got to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

682
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:38,009
secrecy of this facility excuse me

683
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:41,190

the way from Japan to Manchuria so it's

687
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:50,010
your duty to at least try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them</font>

688
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:52,079
home that's reasonable as head of the

689

731 you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for them you</font>

responsibility is the general is right

695
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:06,649
we should all return to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our homeland and</font>

696

bring our data with us

697
