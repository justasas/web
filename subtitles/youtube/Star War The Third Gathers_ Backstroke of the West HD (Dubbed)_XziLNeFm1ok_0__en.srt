1
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,937
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,484
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,819
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,447
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,664
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,043
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,045
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,088
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,021
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,147
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,042
They're all over me.

12
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,170
- Get them off my...
- I'm gonna go help them out.

13
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,673
No. They are doing their job
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,564
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,193
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,037
All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,377
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,221
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,733
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,492
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.

21
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,743
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,377
R4, be careful. You have a...

23
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,425
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,387
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,639
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,933
The mission. Get to the command ship.

27
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,477
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,651
In the name of...

29
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:06,949
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,125
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,296
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,012
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,474
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

35
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,613
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,033
Watch out.

37
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,000
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

38
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,508
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

39
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,721
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

40
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,891
Have you noticed the shields are still up?

41
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,393
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,653
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,378
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,185
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,236
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there...

46
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,406
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,451
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,204
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,872
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,794
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,797
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

52
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,605
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,652
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,072
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,286
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,338
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,341
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,809
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,401
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,820
There's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,780
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

62
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,742
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,787
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,790
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,335
R2, activate the elevator number 31174.

66
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,173
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,216
Activate the elevator 31174.

68
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,802
R2...

69
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,935
Always on the move.

70
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,021
R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?

71
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,732
R2?

72
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,694
R2! R2!

73
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,036
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,373
Hands up, Jedi.

75
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,666
R2, do you copy?

76
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,754
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

77
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,886
Hey, you!

78
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,725
That's better.

79
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,395
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,201
Oh, it's you.

81
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,120
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,582
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been...

83
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,710
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

84
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,753
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,293
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

86
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,878
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,469
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

88
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,649
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,819
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,781
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,367
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,703
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,633
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,927
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,514
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

96
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,577
Get...

97
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,899
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,985
You have hate. You have anger.

99
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,698
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,761
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,223
Kill him.

102
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,267
Kill him now.

103
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,817
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,778
Do it.

105
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,753
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,046
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

107
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,259
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,261
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,475
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,727
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,482
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

112
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,864
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,245
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,706
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

115
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,711
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,880
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,137
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,350
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,320
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,701
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,682
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

122
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,078
Magnetize! Magnetize!

123
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,964
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,888
We're leveling out, sir.

125
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,822
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

126
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,532
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

127
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,826
- What is that?
- Oops.

128
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,913
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,247
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,223
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,433
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,810
R2, do you copy?

133
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,528
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,989
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,243
Ray shields.

136
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,245
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

137
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,705
Apparently not.

138
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,877
- I say patience.
- Patience?

139
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,255
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

140
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,092
and then he'll release the ray shields.

141
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,519
See? No problem.

142
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,439
Don't move.

143
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,694
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,703
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,913
The negotiator.

146
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,251
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,545
Excuse me.

148
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,381
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

149
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,634
And...

150
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,804
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:04,643
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

152
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:11,066
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,987
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,573
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:28,000
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,795
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,921
R2.

158
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,302
Crush them!

159
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,765
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,479
Come. Now!

161
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,773
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,322
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,176
Run!

164
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,640
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,059
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,989
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,890
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,530
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,166
All the escape pods have been launched.

170
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,335
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,172
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

172
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:42,134
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

173
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,427
Strap yourselves in.

174
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,056
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

175
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,949
We lost something.

176
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,536
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

177
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,792
Now we're really picking up speed.

178
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,262
Eight plus 60.

179
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,681
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

180
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,240
Steady.

181
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,410
Easy, R2.

182
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,248
5000.

183
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,292
Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,127
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:06,301
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,750
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,033
Coming, Master?

188
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,579
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,123
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,085
Hold on. This whole
operation was your idea.

191
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,339
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,840
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,884
carrying me unconscious on your back.

194
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,471
All because of your training.

195
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,099
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,603
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,439
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,857
Ninth time.

199
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:49,779
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,661
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

201
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,664
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,461
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,091
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,511
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,513
And I assure you...

206
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,350
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

207
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,521
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

208
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,899
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

209
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,985
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

210
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,238
Thank you, Senator Organa.

211
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,908
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

212
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,536
Now there I agree with you.

213
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,373
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

214
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,710
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

215
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,256
I will do everything I can in the senate.

216
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,092
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

217
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,853
Oh, Anakin.

218
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,899
I've missed you, Padmé.

219
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,320
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

220
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,322
I'm all right.

221
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,076
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

222
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,997
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

223
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,458
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

224
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,210
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

225
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,798
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

226
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:34,175
Anakin, don't say things like that.

227
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,605
Are you all right? You're trembling.

228
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,856
What's going on?

229
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,111
Something wonderful has happened.

230
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,365
Ani, I'm pregnant.

231
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,038
That's...

232
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,837
That's wonderful.

233
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,717
What are we gonna do?

234
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,597
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

235
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,183
This is a happy moment.

236
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,480
The happiest moment of my life.

237
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,464
Yes, Lord Sidious?

238
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,466
General Grievous...

239
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:44,680
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

240
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,851
It will be done, my lord.

241
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:53,023
The end of the war is near, General.

242
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,734
But the loss of Count Dooku...

243
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,989
His death was a necessary loss.

244
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,410
Soon I will have a new apprentice...

245
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:10,789
one far younger and more powerful.

246
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,819
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

247
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,281
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

248
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,283
where we can be safe.

249
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,828
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

250
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,836
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

251
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:05,720
You are so... beautiful.

252
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,391
It's only because I'm so in love.

253
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,144
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

254
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,191
So love has blinded you?

255
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,696
That's not exactly what I meant.

256
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,324
But it's probably true.

257
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,043
Anakin, help me!

258
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,608
What's bothering you?

259
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,029
Nothing.

260
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,326
I remember when I gave this to you.

261
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,622
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

262
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,668
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

263
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,883
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

264
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,301
And?

265
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,681
And it was about you.

266
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,559
Tell me.

267
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,855
It was only a dream.

268
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,746
You die in childbirth.

269
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,665
And the baby?

270
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,085
I don't know.

271
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,798
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

272
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,553
This baby will change our lives.

273
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,472
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

274
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,975
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled...

275
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,019
I know. I know.

276
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,399
Do you think Obi-Wan might
be able to help us?

277
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,443
We don't need his help.

278
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,781
Our baby is a blessing.

279
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,465
Premonitions?

280
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,050
Premonitions.

281
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,387
These visions you have...

282
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,101
They're of pain, suffering.

283
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,938
Death.

284
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,442
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

285
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,946
Someone.

286
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,947
Close to you?

287
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,617
Yes.

288
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,330
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

289
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:05,751
The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.

290
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,505
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

291
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,552
Death is a natural part of life.

292
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:19,349
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

293
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,726
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

294
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,939
Attachment leads to jealousy.

295
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:29,483
The shadow of greed that is.

296
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,819
What must I do, Master Yoda?

297
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,572
Train yourself to let go...

298
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,117
of everything you fear to lose.

299
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,382
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

300
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,094
I'm sorry. I was held up.

301
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:00,097
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

302
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:05,394
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

303
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,396
What's wrong, then?

304
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:13,695
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

305
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,157
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

306
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,702
It'll make it easier for
us to end this war.

307
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,746
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

308
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,291
Be careful of what?

309
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,045
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

310
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,338
He would not say.

311
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:37,009
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

312
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,345
All of this is unusual.

313
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,806
And it's making me feel uneasy.

314
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,780
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

315
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,034
Of course.

316
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,077
I need your help, son.

317
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,248
What do you mean?

318
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,916
I'm depending on you.

319
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,544
For what? I don't understand.

320
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:18,259
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

321
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

322
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,184
Me?

323
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,351
A master?

324
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,606
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

325
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,610
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

326
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,239
I think they will. They need you.

327
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,034
More than you know.

328
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,215
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

329
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,760
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

330
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,513
I understand.

331
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,974
You are on this council...

332
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,685
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

333
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,812
What?

334
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,278
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

335
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,947
It's unfair.

336
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,161
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

337
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,789
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

338
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,502
Forgive me, Master.

339
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,135
We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...

340
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,972
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

341
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,849
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

342
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,061
The outlying systems you must sweep.

343
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,397
We do not have many ships to spare.

344
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,691
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

345
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,485
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

346
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,030
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

347
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,451
Go I will.

348
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,579
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

349
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,290
It's settled then.

350
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:17,419
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

351
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,588
May the Force be with us all.

352
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,468
What kind of nonsense is this?

353
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,971
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

354
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,848
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

355
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,809
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

356
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,896
To be on the council at your age...
it's never happened before.

357
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,442
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

358
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,322
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

359
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,824
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

360
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,161
But it's what you wanted.

361
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,580
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

362
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,583
That has nothing to do with this.

363
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,627
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

364
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,088
is because the chancellor trusts you.

365
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,089
And?

366
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,969
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

367
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,262
What situation?

368
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,687
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

369
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,148
They want to know what he's up to.

370
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,695
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

371
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,282
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

372
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,246
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

373
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,791
This assignment is not to be on record.

374
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,836
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

375
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,964
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

376
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,175
That is why you must help us.

377
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,762
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

378
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,556
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

379
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,643
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

380
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,937
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

381
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,233
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

382
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,237
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

383
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:11,325
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

384
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,538
The council is asking you.

385
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:26,465
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

386
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,552
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

387
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,972
I don't think the boy can handle it.

388
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,016
I don't trust him.

389
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:38,936
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

390
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,356
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

391
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,318
So the prophecy says.

392
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:51,323
A prophecy that misread could have been.

393
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,036
He will not let me down.

394
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,078
He never has.

395
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:00,207
I hope right you are.

396
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,110
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

397
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,072
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

398
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:37,119
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

399
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,121
What do you mean?

400
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,418
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

401
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:48,130
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

402
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,467
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

403
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,389
This war represents a failure to listen.

404
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,517
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

405
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,894
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

406
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,563
Don't ask me to do that.

407
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,777
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

408
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,696
- What is it?
- Nothing.

409
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,869
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

410
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,124
Hold me.

411
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,501
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

412
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,338
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

413
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,967
No politics, no plotting, no war.

414
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,885
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

415
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,970
Come closer. I have good news.

416
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,557
Our clone intelligence units...

417
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,726
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

418
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,438
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

419
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,730
At last.

420
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,318
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

421
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,779
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

422
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,282
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

423
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,745
You're the best choice, by far.

424
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,248
Sit down.

425
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,583
Leave us.

426
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,603
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

427
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,733
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

428
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,778
I'm not sure I understand.

429
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,572
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

430
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,076
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

431
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,371
They're planning to betray me.

432
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,458
- I don't think that...
- Anakin.

433
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,585
Search your feelings.

434
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,340
You know, don't you?

435
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,639
I know they don't trust you.

436
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,058
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

437
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,769
Or democracy, for that matter.

438
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,900
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

439
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,485
Why?

440
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,950
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

441
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,831
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

442
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,961
I don't...

443
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,880
I don't know what to say.

444
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,467
Remember back to your early teachings.

445
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,972
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

446
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,727
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

447
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,980
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

448
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:38,277
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

449
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,073
including their quest for greater power.

450
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,619
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

451
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:50,497
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

452
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,959
And the Jedi don't?

453
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,630
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

454
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,770
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

455
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,945
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

456
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,367
It's a Sith legend.

457
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:31,496
Darth Plagueis was a
dark lord of the Sith...

458
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,500
so powerful and so wise...

459
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:39,462
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

460
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,757
to create... life.

461
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,471
He had such a knowledge of the dark side...

462
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:52,058
he could even keep the
ones he cared about...

463
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,644
from dying.

464
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,735
He could actually...
save people from death?

465
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,116
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

466
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:12,454
some consider to be unnatural.

467
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,416
What happened to him?

468
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:18,585
He became so powerful...

469
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,964
the only thing he was afraid of was...

470
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,049
losing his power.

471
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,302
Which eventually, of course, he did.

472
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:33,684
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

473
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,104
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

474
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,067
It's ironic.

475
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,318
He could save others from death...

476
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,531
but not himself.

477
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,246
Is it possible to learn this power?

478
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,210
Not from a Jedi.

479
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,979
All Red units, over here!

480
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,160
Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?

481
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,871
A partial message was intercepted...

482
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,456
in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.

483
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,128
Act on this we must.

484
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,965
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

485
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,887
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

486
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:57,017
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

487
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,436
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

488
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,523
not the chancellor.

489
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:07,568
A master is needed, with more experience.

490
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,072
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

491
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,700
I agree.

492
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,951
Aye.

493
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,619
Aye.

494
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,664
Very well. Council adjourned.

495
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,257
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

496
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,846
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,986
Charge!

498
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,043
Head for cover!

499
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:24,354
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

500
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,315
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

501
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,567
Master.

502
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:35,824
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

503
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:39,702
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

504
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,789
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

505
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,838
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

506
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,548
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

507
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,760
I have taught you everything I know.

508
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,639
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

509
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,432
But be patient, Anakin.

510
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,478
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

511
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,114
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

512
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,117
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

513
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:46,268
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

514
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,020
On the far side.

515
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:50,440
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

516
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,985
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

517
00:51:55,362 --> 00:52:00,533
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

518
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,728
Save your energy.

519
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,188
I can't.

520
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,065
Don't give up, Padmé.

521
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,414
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

522
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,166
He came by this morning.

523
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,461
What did he want?

524
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,504
He's worried about you.

525
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,260
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

526
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,806
I feel lost.

527
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,101
Lost? What do you mean?

528
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,398
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

529
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,902
They trust you with their lives.

530
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,112
Something's happening.

531
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,449
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

532
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,745
I want more.

533
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,874
And I know I shouldn't.

534
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961
You expect too much of yourself.

535
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:42,135
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

536
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,178
From my nightmares.

537
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,222
Is that what's bothering you?

538
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,183
I won't lose you, Padmé.

539
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,103
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

540
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,648
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

541
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:40,986
Greetings, young Jedi.

542
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,530
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

543
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,574
Unfortunately, the war.

544
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,246
There's no war here...
unless you brought it with you.

545
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,540
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

546
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:59,588
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

547
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,849
He is here. We are being held hostage.

548
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,853
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

549
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:19,773
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

550
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,318
Tell your people to take shelter.

551
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,404
If you have warriors, now is the time.

552
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,545
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

553
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:46,593
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

554
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:34,139
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

555
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:41,981
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

556
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,782
It is a volcanic planet.

557
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,202
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

558
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:59,290
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

559
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:03,836
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

560
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:09,884
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

561
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,016
Your ship is waiting.

562
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,159
Hello there.

563
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,539
General Kenobi.

564
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,045
You are a bold one.

565
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,547
Kill him.

566
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:05,815
Back away.

567
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,528
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

568
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,112
Your move.

569
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,657
You fool.

570
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:20,580
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

571
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,589
Attack, Kenobi.

572
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,231
Go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

573
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,233
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

574
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,819
Cover yourself. Come on.

575
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,160
Move it! Move it!

576
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,830
Come on, move! Come on, everybody!

577
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,251
Army or not...

578
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:53,465
you must realize you are doomed.

579
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,550
I don't think so.

580
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,735
Cover that corner.

581
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,826
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

582
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,704
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

583
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:09,082
and we have begun our attack.

584
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,917
Thank you, Commander.

585
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:15,129
Anakin, deliver this
report to the chancellor.

586
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,507
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

587
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,092
Yes, Master.

588
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,018
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

589
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,396
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

590
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,316
If he does not give up
his emergency powers...

591
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,317
after the destruction of Grievous...

592
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,653
then he should be removed from office.

593
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,657
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

594
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,660
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

595
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:50,248
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

596
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,210
Great care we must take.

597
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,510
Chancellor.

598
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,806
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

599
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,558
He has engaged General Grievous.

600
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,021
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

601
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,858
I should be there with him.

602
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,318
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

603
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,486
doesn't seem to fully
appreciate your talents.

604
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,909
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

605
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,580
I wish I knew.

606
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,416
More and more I get the feeling that...

607
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,753
I'm being excluded from the council.

608
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:47,679
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

609
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,351
They don't trust you, Anakin.

610
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,103
They see your future.

611
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,107
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

612
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:05,323
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

613
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:11,496
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

614
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:14,374
How do you know the ways of the Force?

615
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,461
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

616
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:22,215
Even the nature of the dark side.

617
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,552
You know the dark side?

618
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,474
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

619
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,977
one must study all its aspects...

620
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,230
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

621
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,109
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

622
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,904
you must embrace a larger
view of the Force.

623
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,657
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

624
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:54,871
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

625
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:58,250
Learn to know the dark side of the Force...

626
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:02,003
and you will be able to save your wife...

627
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,172
from certain death.

628
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,175
What did you say?

629
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,929
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

630
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,809
You're the Sith lord.

631
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,771
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

632
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:23,442
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

633
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:29,030
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

634
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,701
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

635
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,202
A life of significance...

636
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,788
of conscience.

637
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:45,088
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

638
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,550
I know you would.

639
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,472
I can feel your anger.

640
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:55,266
It gives you focus...

641
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,726
makes you stronger.

642
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,360
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

643
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,112
Of course. You should.

644
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:11,240
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

645
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,867
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

646
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,413
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

647
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:21,166
Know the power of the dark side.

648
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,045
Power to save Padmé.

649
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,757
So uncivilized.

650
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,267
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

651
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,187
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

652
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,190
We're on our way to make sure...

653
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,567
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

654
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:55,320
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

655
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,573
I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.

656
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,576
A Sith lord?

657
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,537
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

658
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,665
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

659
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,835
He's been trained to use the dark side.

660
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,755
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

661
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,425
Then our worst fears have been realized.

662
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,012
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

663
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,555
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

664
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,933
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

665
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,979
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

666
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:30,855
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

667
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,108
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

668
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,194
- I must go, Master.
- No.

669
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,366
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

670
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,036
But for now, remain here.

671
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,039
Wait in the council
chambers until we return.

672
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,585
Yes, Master.

673
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,951
You do know, don't you...

674
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,412
if the Jedi destroy me...

675
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:30,498
any chance of saving her will be lost.

676
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:03,843
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

677
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,221
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

678
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:10,932
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

679
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,976
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

680
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,688
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

681
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,730
The senate will decide your fate.

682
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:21,693
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

683
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:29,368
It's treason then.

684
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,887
You are under arrest, my lord.

685
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:17,309
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

686
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,561
The Jedi are taking over.

687
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,146
The oppression of the
Sith will never return.

688
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,483
You have lost.

689
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,280
You will die!

690
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:34,910
He's a traitor!

691
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,203
He is the traitor!

692
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:44,545
I have the power to save the one you love.

693
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:47,463
You must choose.

694
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:51,135
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

695
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,846
Don't let him kill me.

696
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,686
I can't hold it any longer.

697
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,105
I can't. I'm weak.

698
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,190
I'm too weak.

699
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,734
Anakin!

700
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,321
Help me. Help me!

701
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,993
I can't hold on any longer.

702
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,706
I am going to end this once and for all.

703
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,291
You can't.

704
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,376
He must stand trial.

705
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,837
He has control of the
senate and the courts.

706
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:30,173
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

707
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,550
I'm too weak.

708
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,262
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

709
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,890
He must live.

710
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,561
- Please don't.
- I need him.

711
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:45,689
Please don't!

712
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:54,740
Power!

713
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,959
Unlimited power!

714
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,097
What have I done?

715
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:31,360
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

716
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,280
Become my apprentice.

717
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:40,827
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

718
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,458
I will do whatever you ask.

719
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,087
Good.

720
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:55,384
Just help me save Padmé's life.

721
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:59,720
I can't live without her.

722
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:08,271
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

723
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,358
but if we work together...

724
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:15,487
I know we can discover the secret.

725
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,948
I pledge myself...

726
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,536
to your teachings.

727
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,204
Good.

728
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,500
Good.

729
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:41,180
The Force is strong with you.

730
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:46,851
A powerful Sith you will become.

731
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:51,230
Henceforth you shall be known as...

732
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:55,234
Darth... Vader.

733
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,202
Thank you, my master.

734
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,872
Rise.

735
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:25,474
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

736
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:31,813
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

737
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,859
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

738
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:39,905
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

739
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,157
I agree.

740
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:46,744
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

741
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,539
Every single Jedi...

742
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,917
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

743
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,588
is now an enemy of the Republic.

744
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,591
I understand, Master.

745
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,301
We must move quickly.

746
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,345
The Jedi are relentless.

747
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:10,269
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

748
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:15,774
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

749
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:19,903
We will catch them off-balance.

750
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:23,990
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

751
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:27,493
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

752
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:32,958
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

753
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,085
to save Padmé.

754
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:40,047
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

755
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,260
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

756
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,431
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

757
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,225
go to the Mustafar system.

758
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,604
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

759
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:58,150
and the other separatist leaders.

760
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:04,155
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

761
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:07,117
And...

762
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:12,331
we shall have... peace.

763
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,417
Sergeant, over here!

764
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:00,378
Hurry! All of them!

765
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,049
All Red units, let's move it!

766
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,051
Come on. Let's go!

767
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,942
Commander, contact your troops.

768
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,985
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

769
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,988
Very good, sir.

770
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:29,240
By the way, I think you'll be needing this.

771
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,619
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

772
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:34,912
Yes, sir.

773
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:43,171
Commander Cody...

774
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,175
the time has come.

775
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,555
Execute order 66.

776
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:54,224
Yes, my lord.

777
01:20:58,061 --> 01:20:59,438
Blast him!

778
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,798
Come on!

779
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:21,520
Execute order 66.

780
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,146
It will be done, my lord.

781
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,942
It will be done, my lord.

782
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,188
Master Skywalker, there
are too many of them.

783
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,275
What are we going to do?

784
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,914
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

785
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,126
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right.

786
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:40,408
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

787
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,119
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

788
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,456
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

789
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,168
And so it is.

790
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,757
Get him!

791
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,192
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

792
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,015
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

793
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:46,599
Yes, sir.

794
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,609
Good-bye, Tarfful.

795
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,695
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

796
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,407
Miss you I will.

797
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:42,781
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

798
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,199
before they walk into this catastrophe.

799
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,873
Did you find Kenobi?

800
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,917
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

801
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,296
Start loading your men on the ships.

802
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,881
Move it.

803
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,207
Emergency code 913.

804
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,210
I have no contact on any frequency.

805
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,380
Master Kenobi.

806
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,466
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

807
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:47,512
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

808
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,389
We have just rescued Master Yoda.

809
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:52,600
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

810
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,853
We're sending you our coordinates.

811
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,487
Hush! Not so loud.

812
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:07,614
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

813
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,117
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

814
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,119
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

815
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:13,871
What's happening?

816
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,833
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

817
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,460
I can't believe that.

818
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:23,131
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

819
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:27,719
What are you gonna do?

820
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,605
I will not betray the Republic.

821
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,524
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

822
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,404
and with the senate and with you.

823
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,408
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

824
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,244
Many Jedi have been killed.

825
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,206
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

826
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:59,626
Anakin, I'm afraid.

827
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,671
Have faith, my love.

828
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,090
Everything will soon be set right.

829
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,970
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

830
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:13,932
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

831
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:18,519
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

832
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:21,021
Things will be different. I promise.

833
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:28,820
Please, wait for me.

834
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,620
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

835
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,791
Take care, my little friend.

836
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:47,757
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

837
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,426
No, thank you, 3PO.

838
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:55,222
I feel so helpless.

839
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,416
How many other Jedi have managed to survive?

840
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,085
Heard from no one have we.

841
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,047
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

842
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,048
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

843
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,592
Have we had any contact from the temple?

844
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:35,680
Received a coded retreat message we have.

845
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:39,809
It requests all Jedi to
return to the temple.

846
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:43,354
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

847
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:46,983
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

848
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,903
Suggest dismantling the
coded signal, do you?

849
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,740
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

850
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,409
I agree.

851
01:30:57,493 --> 01:31:01,121
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

852
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,520
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

853
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:28,398
You have done well, Viceroy.

854
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:34,322
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

855
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:37,949
he will take care of you.

856
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,714
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

857
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,759
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:31:56,470 --> 01:32:01,182
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

859
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,266
at a special session of Congress.

860
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,938
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

861
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,193
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

862
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:16,405
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

863
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,448
without keeping the senate intact.

864
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:22,578
If a special session of
Congress there is...

865
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:25,997
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

866
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:06,456
R2, stay with the ship.

867
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,900
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

868
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:11,270
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

869
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,437
What's happened?

870
01:34:12,523 --> 01:34:17,068
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

871
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:22,657
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

872
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:40,925
Not even the younglings survived.

873
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:47,390
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

874
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,059
By a lightsaber he was.

875
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,484
Who?

876
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,487
Who could have done this?

877
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:15,376
The attempt on my life...

878
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:20,381
has left me scarred and deformed.

879
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,217
But I assure you.

880
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:29,055
My resolve has never been stronger!

881
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,478
Stop!

882
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:53,079
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

883
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:57,083
the Republic will be reorganized...

884
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:02,672
into the first Galactic Empire!

885
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:09,430
For a safe and secure society.

886
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:20,899
So this is how liberty dies.

887
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,362
With thunderous applause.

888
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,948
The war is over.

889
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,203
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want...

890
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:46,008
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

891
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,551
For the clones...

892
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,764
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

893
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,569
Wait. Master.

894
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:10,449
There is something I must know.

895
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:21,001
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

896
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,671
I must know the truth, Master.

897
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,389
It can't be.

898
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:35,390
It can't be.

899
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:39,562
You have done well, my new apprentice.

900
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:42,689
Now, Lord Vader...

901
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,318
go and bring peace to the Empire.

902
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:48,612
I can't watch any more.

903
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:53,284
Destroy the Sith we must.

904
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,163
Send me to kill the emperor.

905
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,539
I will not kill Anakin.

906
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:04,377
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

907
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:07,756
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

908
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:13,554
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

909
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:17,056
The boy you trained, gone he is.

910
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:20,059
Consumed by Darth Vader.

911
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:23,189
I do not know where the
emperor has sent him.

912
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:25,524
I don't know where to look.

913
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,529
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

914
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,083
When was the last time you saw him?

915
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:47,171
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

916
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,677
Padmé, I need your help.

917
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:57,013
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

918
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,265
From himself.

919
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,105
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

920
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,693
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

921
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:17,493
I have seen a security hologram...
of him...

922
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,829
killing younglings.

923
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:23,998
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

924
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:27,043
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

925
01:39:27,878 --> 01:39:31,673
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

926
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:36,220
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

927
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:40,431
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

928
01:39:46,605 --> 01:39:48,606
I don't believe you.

929
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,484
I can't.

930
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:01,953
I must find him.

931
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:06,417
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

932
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:12,590
He has become a very great threat.

933
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,677
I can't.

934
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,318
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

935
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,699
I'm so sorry.

936
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,747
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

937
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,041
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

938
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,542
As you wish, milady, but
I strongly disagree.

939
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:35,296
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

940
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:37,799
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

941
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,512
Oh, dear.

942
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,110
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

943
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:28,891
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

944
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:31,894
It is finished then.

945
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:39,110
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

946
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:44,115
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

947
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:49,412
All droid units must shut down immediately.

948
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,248
Very good, my lord.

949
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,601
I saw your ship.

950
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:59,440
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

951
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:03,737
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

952
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:05,404
What things?

953
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,033
He said you've turned to the dark side.

954
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:13,788
That you... killed younglings.

955
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:18,001
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

956
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:20,003
He cares about us.

957
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:21,879
Us?

958
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:23,465
He knows.

959
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:26,718
He wants to help you.

960
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:33,809
Anakin, all I want is your love.

961
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,270
Love won't save you, Padmé.

962
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:39,606
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

963
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,108
You're a good person. Don't do this.

964
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,945
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

965
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,283
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

966
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:52,202
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

967
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:55,497
Come away with me.

968
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:58,250
Help me raise our child.

969
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,170
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

970
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:05,215
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away anymore.

971
01:45:06,009 --> 01:45:08,551
I have brought peace to the Republic.

972
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,512
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

973
01:45:11,597 --> 01:45:13,724
I can overthrow him.

974
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,854
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

975
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,398
make things the way we want them to be.

976
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:29,739
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

977
01:45:31,201 --> 01:45:34,536
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

978
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,583
I don't want to hear any
more about Obi-Wan.

979
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:43,878
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

980
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:47,590
I don't know you anymore.

981
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:53,262
You're breaking my heart.

982
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,934
You're going down a path I can't follow.

983
01:45:57,894 --> 01:45:59,811
Because of Obi-Wan?

984
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,689
Because of what you've done.

985
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:04,733
What you plan to do.

986
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:08,612
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

987
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:11,657
- I love you.
- Liar!

988
01:46:16,453 --> 01:46:20,248
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

989
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,292
Let her go, Anakin.

990
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,673
Let her go.

991
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:40,685
You turned her against me!

992
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,480
You have done that yourself.

993
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,404
You will not take her from me!

994
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:55,366
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

995
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:03,666
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

996
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:08,422
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

997
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:10,423
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

998
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:13,050
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

999
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,554
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1000
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,309
I have brought peace...

1001
01:47:20,393 --> 01:47:25,188
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

1002
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,317
Your new empire?

1003
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,193
Don't make me kill you.

1004
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:37,074
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

1005
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:39,911
If you're not with me...

1006
01:47:40,787 --> 01:47:42,705
then you're my enemy.

1007
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,210
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1008
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,631
I will do what I must.

1009
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,717
You will try.

1010
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:30,503
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1011
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:35,091
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1012
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:37,803
Master Yoda.

1013
01:48:37,886 --> 01:48:39,595
You survived.

1014
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:41,847
Surprised?

1015
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:47,144
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1016
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,313
Now you will experience...

1017
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:53,902
the full power of the dark side.

1018
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:41,532
I have waited a long
time for this moment...

1019
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:46,829
my little green friend.

1020
01:49:57,007 --> 01:50:00,510
At last the Jedi are no more.

1021
01:50:00,595 --> 01:50:04,847
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1022
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:12,521
At an end your rule is.

1023
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,860
And not short enough it was.

1024
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:23,824
If so powerful you are...

1025
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:26,536
why leave?

1026
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:30,039
You will not stop me.

1027
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:34,752
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1028
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:39,216
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1029
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:44,596
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1030
01:55:12,198 --> 01:55:14,949
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1031
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,868
Activate your homing
beacon when you're ready.

1032
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:20,330
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1033
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:24,082
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1034
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:26,460
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1035
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:31,632
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1036
01:55:31,716 --> 01:55:36,845
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1037
01:56:45,623 --> 01:56:48,835
Into exile I must go.

1038
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:51,628
Failed I have.

1039
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:32,980
I have failed you, Anakin.

1040
01:58:33,064 --> 01:58:34,982
I have failed you.

1041
01:58:35,067 --> 01:58:37,985
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1042
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,904
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1043
01:58:40,989 --> 01:58:43,657
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1044
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:45,368
Then you are lost!

1045
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:59,756
This is the end for you, my master.

1046
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:27,409
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1047
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:32,748
You underestimate my power.

1048
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,251
Don't try it.

1049
01:59:58,108 --> 02:00:00,109
You were the chosen one!

1050
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:04,780
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1051
02:00:07,408 --> 02:00:11,244
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1052
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:25,259
I hate you!

1053
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,976
You were my brother, Anakin.

1054
02:00:36,979 --> 02:00:39,356
I loved you.

1055
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:23,317
Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padmé on board.

1056
02:01:23,402 --> 02:01:25,528
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1057
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:28,489
We should leave this dreadful place.

1058
02:01:44,006 --> 02:01:46,007
Is Anakin all right?

1059
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:56,786
Your Majesty, this way.

1060
02:02:57,703 --> 02:02:59,621
There he is.

1061
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,916
He's still alive.

1062
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:07,128
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1063
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:09,215
Yes, sir. Right away.

1064
02:03:45,167 --> 02:03:47,127
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1065
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:55,219
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1066
02:04:12,029 --> 02:04:14,488
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1067
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:47,021
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1068
02:04:47,104 --> 02:04:50,357
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1069
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:54,445
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1070
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,614
She has lost the will to live.

1071
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:59,867
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1072
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,577
Babies?

1073
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,578
She's carrying twins.

1074
02:05:45,704 --> 02:05:47,206
Luke.

1075
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:56,881
Oh, Luke.

1076
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:21,699
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1077
02:07:11,123 --> 02:07:13,041
There's good in him.

1078
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,129
I know.

1079
02:07:17,796 --> 02:07:21,424
I know there's... still...

1080
02:07:56,627 --> 02:07:58,127
Lord Vader.

1081
02:07:59,421 --> 02:08:01,589
Can you hear me?

1082
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:06,095
Yes, Master.

1083
02:08:09,181 --> 02:08:11,099
Where is Padmé?

1084
02:08:12,894 --> 02:08:14,811
Is she safe?

1085
02:08:15,896 --> 02:08:17,939
Is she all right?

1086
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:24,196
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1087
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,117
I? I couldn't have.

1088
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:31,244
She was alive. I felt it!

1089
02:08:50,974 --> 02:08:53,475
No!

1090
02:09:05,154 --> 02:09:08,823
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1091
02:09:10,577 --> 02:09:14,163
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1092
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,833
Split up they should be.

1093
02:09:19,502 --> 02:09:21,462
My wife and I will take the girl.

1094
02:09:23,006 --> 02:09:25,923
We've always talked of
adopting a baby girl.

1095
02:09:26,009 --> 02:09:28,301
She will be loved with us.

1096
02:09:29,179 --> 02:09:31,180
And what of the boy?

1097
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:35,643
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1098
02:09:37,436 --> 02:09:39,896
I will take the child and watch over him.

1099
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:49,030
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1100
02:09:50,824 --> 02:09:54,452
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1101
02:09:55,954 --> 02:10:01,210
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1102
02:10:02,503 --> 02:10:03,836
Training?

1103
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:08,549
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1104
02:10:10,552 --> 02:10:13,680
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1105
02:10:13,765 --> 02:10:16,225
Your old master.

1106
02:10:16,893 --> 02:10:18,394
Qui-Gon?

1107
02:10:20,896 --> 02:10:24,190
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1108
02:10:25,652 --> 02:10:27,819
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1109
02:10:27,904 --> 02:10:29,822
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1110
02:10:29,905 --> 02:10:31,823
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1111
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:33,826
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1112
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:35,411
What?

1113
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:39,248
Oh, no!
