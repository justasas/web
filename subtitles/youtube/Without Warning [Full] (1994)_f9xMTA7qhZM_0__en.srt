this time let me just say from the

00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,139
outset that what we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

524
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,090
is based on findings that are

preliminary at best she didn't get that

526
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:18,548
the findings are not I repeat not

527
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:20,168
definitive data just analyzed by the

Mongolia here and here all three sites

540
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:59,679
were located at 45 degrees north

541
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:03,879

542
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,769
at this point broke up over the North

that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct made no conclusions at</font>

545
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:13,869
this point well what are the chances

546
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:15,158
that a random asteroid would hit and

547
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:18,729
break<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fall with such precision</font>

551
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,970
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten him down here any</font>

faster if you'd shot him from a cannon

553
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:30,460
so what's your point well according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">his bio he is a founding member of Seti</font>

555
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,659

a half dozen major comets dr. Perlman

640
00:27:53,250 --> 00:28:00,089
what's the significance of tonight's

641
00:27:55,589 --> 00:28:02,548
event well you see in in astronomical

642
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:05,668
terms tonight's event coming so close to

643
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:07,500
shoemaker-levy 9 is really unique in

644
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:10,080
recorded history we understand that you

645
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a photograph of 6645</font>

646
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:16,980
venturi taken just before it broke up um

647
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:20,278
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken at an elevation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 12,500</font>

648
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">miles above the pole now four minutes</font>

649
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:25,558
later when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we attempted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

sander van ochre Oh mr. von ocher I

652
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:33,058
understand you're the co-chair with dr.

653
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,028
Avram Mandel of SETI the search for

654
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:37,319
extraterrestrial intelligence I am well

655
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:39,269
doctor what do you make of the

656
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,819
announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> by NASA the asteroid</font>

657
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,470
fragments struck and precise order well

658
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:47,638
it just confirms what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've been saying</font>

659
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,860
for years I mean with with 200 billion

660
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:52,709
stellar systems in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Milky Way galaxy</font>

661
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:55,589
alone the existence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligent life</font>

662
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,509
beyond Earth is undeniable perhaps but

663
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:59,189
why jump to that conclusion in this case

664
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because the asteroid fragments hit</font>

665
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,230
at the same latitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

666
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a very very good question let me</font>

667
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:13,190
see if this yes yes uh can you see this

668
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,650
yes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6645 venturi</font>

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,279
that happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

674
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:33,199
like go tens of the 58th power so what

675
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you saying I'm saying that what</font>

676
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:41,120
we've seen tonight is unnatural could it

677
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,310
happen at random not a chance oh thank

678
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,019
you doctor that was astronomer Robert

this point because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking</font>

I ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the UFO mr. Haskell</font>

699
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:39,019
already said all I'm gonna say party

701
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:44,809
why were you in there so long<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gilly much</font>

702
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,819
luck since Haskell refuses to talk we

703

tape this interview with sheriff's

deputy Hanson Peters the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> official</font>

705
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:54,589
to speak with Haskell he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that he</font>

706
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:57,710
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming down at around 6 45</font>

707
00:30:54,589 --> 00:31:00,349
after Dustin all day anyway Haskell was

708
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,910
shaken<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the man was terrified he</font>

709
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:04,909
said he was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming in when this</font>

710
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,130
thing appeared on his right hand side

711
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,019
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if all him a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred feet as he</font>

712
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,760
landed and then it streaked across his

713
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:13,190
windshield than the thing took off

714
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:15,859
straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> up like shot at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point the</font>

no<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment this is Barry Steinbrenner</font>

719
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:28,339
Katie ml Action News Wyoming well we've

720
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,049
just learned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. Haskell has sold</font>

721
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:32,569
his story to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the National Enquirer</font>

722
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:35,119
though he denies<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full purchase</font>

723
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:38,269
price is believed to be upwards of 100

724
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,699
thousand dollars well was there<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

725
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:42,650
something up there tonight we took our

726
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,500
cameras outside just moments ago to get

727
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:51,450
reactions do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in UFOs</font>

728
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:54,390
I don't know I like aliens I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

729
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:57,779
theory I have no doubt that he's a UFO

730
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:01,080
um I definitely definitely don't think

731
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you have what's he done that to me</font>

732
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,250
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just humans arrogancy to think that</font>

733
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,040
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be explained with</font>

734
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,369
scientific data and information I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

735
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,440
for years we've always assumed that

736
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:16,500
there's no life on other planets<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke</font>

737
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:22,440
why would I be there I'm not surprised I

738
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:28,440
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I really don't i don't</font>

739
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,090
believe in aliens all right did you know

740
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,460
the White House has been noticeably

741
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:34,829
silent in all this the president's out

742
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,319
of the country at the g7 economic summit

743
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:39,059
and for him that may be a blessing but

744
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,069
there's at least one segment of the

745
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,710
administration willing to comment on the

746
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:46,139
alleged UFO incident we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to</font>

747
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,269
national security correspondent Mark

748
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Minetti at the Pentagon here with me</font>

749
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,379
tonight is a deputy undersecretary of

752
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,369

753
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:05,490
fragments came in I suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that talk of</font>

754
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:06,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">UFOs was inevitable absolutely they all</font>

755
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,720
come out of the woodwork at times like

756
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this i granted the the crop duster</font>

757
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,620
report has yet to be confirmed but what

758
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:16,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the findings of dr. Robert</font>

759
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:20,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pearlman he's a respected scientist look</font>

760
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:22,710
there's an irresponsible segment of the

761
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">scientific community that seems bent on</font>

762
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,870
proving the existence of little green

763
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:29,250
men and that's fine the problem is is

764
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:33,209
that the US has been trying to establish

765
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,890

774
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,210
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the geometric pattern of the</font>

775
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:00,549
crashes I mean how could something so

776
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,279
precise simply be attributed as a

777
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:06,339
natural phenomenon well I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

778
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,289
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you snowflakes hundreds</font>

780
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:14,380
each with an intricate geometric pattern

781
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:15,699
and no two alike nature is precise in

782
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,690
its randomness and that is the

783
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:22,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">fascination of it thank you doctor back</font>

784
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,280
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sandy with these allegations of</font>

785
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:27,339

what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the radio signals jamming air</font>

me just wait let me just tell you one

1169
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,820
other thing and that is that the missile

1170
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,199
hardware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used is identical</font>

1171
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,940
to that which was deployed so

1172
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,939
successfully in the Gulf War that's all

1173
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,730
there's word just in that the event will

1174
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,920
be monitored live at the Johnson Space

1175
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:16,260
Center they're deciding whether or not

1176
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,030
to give the media access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the feed but</font>

1177
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,280
NASA which has been quite quiet

1178
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:22,950
throughout much of this crisis now seems

1179
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,060
to be opening up Matt Jensen's live in

1180
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:29,129
Houston why the sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn around sandy</font>

1181
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,139
no one here wants to openly break ranks

1182
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,369
with the White House or the Pentagon but

1183
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:34,049
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number of scientists who are</font>

1184
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:36,839
unsure<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the use of nuclear weapons</font>

1185

among them dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kurt loudon who we spoke</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your concern</font>

1187
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:45,090
simply this with an incoming projectile

1188
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:46,530
moving at 50 times the speed of sound at

1189
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,680
close quarters air engagement may be

1190
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:51,900
quite ineffective also the prospect of a

1191
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,059
nuclear burst over the ice cap may

1192
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,680
produce consequences even more dire for

1193
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,630
the Earth's for the Earth's ecology

1194
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,569
ladies and gentlemen the point being

1195
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:02,400

frankly unforgivable there is a force

1343
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,109
behind these asteroids that is clearly

1344
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,940
intelligent the fact that they chose to

1345
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,470
land first in unpopulated areas

1346
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:38,289
demonstrates clearly that they meant us

1347
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:40,000
no harm the radio signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> was acting</font>

1348
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:42,159
nearly as a sort of transponder to help

Arizona dr. Perlman can you hear me yes

1498
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:10,940
thanks this is a 3d<font color="#E5E5E5"> model of 6 645</font>

1503

designated alpha Bravo and Charlie as i

1505
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,318
connect the trajectories you will see

1506
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:33,440
what looks like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> diamond shaped pyramid</font>

1507
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:37,099
with its apex above the pole the angles

1508
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,720
on impact are exactly 45 degrees forgive

1509
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,519
me dr. Perlman but that looks remarkably

1510
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,558
like the line drawn you showed us

1511
01:05:40,518 --> 01:05:45,889
earlier what's so new about this model

1512
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:49,250
well it will become<font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I show</font>

1513
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:52,129
you this now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an exact</font>

01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:56,239
reproduction of a pixelated message that

1515
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:59,150
was sent out in 1973 on pioneer 11 here

1516
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:01,879
you will see symbols for man the solar

1517
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:04,130
system the DNA double helix which is the

1518
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,930
basic molecule of life and a figure

itself you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will note the upside-down</font>

1522
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:24,829
it's unmistakable the asteroid<font color="#E5E5E5"> fragments</font>

1523
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:26,719
represented a symbol they were using the

1524

descent vectors to send us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font>

1525
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:31,939
that's an intriguing theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. perma</font>

1526
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:34,940
but I'm sure you'll agree it's subject

1527
