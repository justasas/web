- Hi.
- Hi.

14
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,319
What's new?

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Manyukhin got
pipes burst on his site.

16
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,879
That's what she's like, an Odessa girl,
A delicate, lively Odessa girl,

17
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
She dances and sings,

18
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,120
The kisses she brings
To those who with merriment rings!

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,680
Daddy, daddy, what are we to do
When the freezing cold comes?

20
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,039
You have no warm kerchief,
You have no winter coat!

21
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,159
How is our exemplary student?

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
Our exemplary student went for a walk.

23
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,560
Vovka, go buy bread. I forgot to.

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
Yes, and buy some macaroni.

25
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,680
Comrade, there's a man there
who says he's an alien.

26
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,599
- We have to do something.
- Call the ambulance.

27
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,479
I will, but he's all but barefoot,
he may catch a cold.

28
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

29
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,479
Sorry, I smell bad. It's cold.
I took this from an iron box.

30
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,000
Good for you.

31
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,480
Friend, tell me the number
of your planet in the Tentura,

32
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,080
or at least the number of your
galaxy in the Spiral.

33
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,959
Because I mixed up contacts
and can't return home now.

34
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,240
We don't know the number.
We forgot it, dear.

35
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,840
The boy will go and
call the information,

36
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,919
and we'll wait for him
in a bread shop. All right?

37
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,759
Meanwhile, put this on.

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,360
Oh, thank you.
Listen, friends.

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,840
Forget the bread shop,
forget the information.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,439
This is my planet.

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
UZM 247 in the Tentura.

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Beta Galaxy in the Spiral.

43
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,439
This is the machine
for moving over in space.

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,840
Which contact shall I push
to move back home?

45
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,759
Because time is relative.
You must know that?

46
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,399
We have a suggestion:
we push the contacts

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
and move to your place.

48
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,560
But if the machine doesn't work,

49
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,439
then you will move
where we move you.

50
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Is it a deal?

51
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,239
No, we can't.

52
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
- One should know.
- We can.

53
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,719
- What do you see?
- Sand.

54
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,680
So that bullshit worked.

55
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,959
And that goat with holes,
did he stay back there?

56
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,800
Stay cool.

57
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,439
There's the sun. There's the sand.
There's gravitation.

58
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,799
Where are we? We are on Earth.

59
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,199
- Or...
- Or?

60
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,359
Let's suppose we're on Earth,
in a desert.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,439
The Kara Kum?
What other deserts do we have?

62
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,479
- Gobi, Sahara.
- I said, we have.

63
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,759
We have Kyzyl Kum, too.

64
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,319
No, let's suppose
it's Kara Kum.

65
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,959
All right.
The sun is in the west.

66
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,280
So Ashkhabad must be there.
Got it? Let's go.

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,439
Come on! Come on!

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,200

Vladimir Nikolayevich.

72
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,120
And I'm Gedevan.

73
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,959
Nice meeting you.

74
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,040

79
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,439
Do you remember
what number did he say,

80
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,719
the one who got my sock?

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,279
No, I don't.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,319
Maybe we're on the planet
from which he moved to ours?

83
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,680
Look, violinist,

84
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
whatever we may guess,
we won't know a damn thing.

85
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,679
We've chosen the direction, and we're
walking.

86
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,639
First thing we must get to the water.
You get it?

87
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,439
Vladimir Nikolayevich,
I'd like to put my slippers on.

88
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,919
Put them on!

89
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,040
You have to stop then!

90
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,800
What time is it?

91
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,399
- Four o'clock.
- At night?

92
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,479
At night.

93
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,840
Are you being late?

94
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,919
It's so embarrassing.

95
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,080
I called from the airport and said I'd
come in an hour, and now...

96
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,480
You study at the conservatory?

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,600
No, it's not mine.
It's Professor Rogozin's.

98
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,919
He was giving us a sponsor concert,

99
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
and then they forgot to put
his violin in the plane.

100
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,120
- It was a banquet?
- No, a dinner.

101
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,120
- You from Tbilisi?
- From Batumi.

102
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,199
I thought I'd give him the violin
and catch the last electric train.

103
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,360
I study in Ivanovo, at a textile school.

104
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,759
I took entrance exams for the Institute
of International Relations,

105
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,800
but they said that I'm...

106
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,319
Quiet.

107
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,559
Koo!

108
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,919
A human.

109
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,919
Koo!

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,440
- Koo.
- Hello.

111
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,159
Koo!

112
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,000
Capitalist country.

113
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,120
Koo! Koo! Koo!

114
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
You know foreign languages?

115
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,760
English.
A little bit of French.

116
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
Tell them we don't have any money.

117
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,360
Tell them. They want us to pay.

118
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Gentlemen, sorry!
We haven't money. Now!

119
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
Koo.

120
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,440
Hello.

121
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,759
We're our tourists.
We've lost our group.

122
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,720
Give us a lift to town, then we'll
manage somehow. Translate.

123
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,879
Do you speak English?

124
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,799
Koo?

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,480
- Parlez vous Francais?
- Koo?

126
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
Hi.

127
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,759
Do you speak English?
Parlez vous Francais?

128
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,040
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

129
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,679
Koo?

130
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,279
Chatl.

131
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,319
No money.

132
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,240
Money, documents, currency, -
our guide has got all.

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,399
Well, this is the situation.

134
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,160
We stepped aside for a second
and got lost in the sands.

135
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,679
Ku.

136
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,559
Here. It's warm.

137
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
Koo?

138
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
- I beg your pardon?
- Koo.

139
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,240
You want the hat?

140
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,519
You're welcome.

141
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,599
This is not mine, I can't give it.

142
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,519
There's nothing inside.

143
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,519
Open it.

144
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,439
It's not wine, it's vinegar.

145
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,919
Koo!

146
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,039
- Ku!
- Sour, isn't it?

147
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,120
Is it a deal, friend?
Will you give us a lift?

148
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,640
Violinist, hurry up.

149
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,280
Only to the nearest town,
then we'll manage ourselves.

150
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,839
Koo!

151
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,799
The sweater?

152
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,639
Bastards!

153
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,559
Good I didn't give them the violin.

154
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,000
They got ashamed.

155
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,879
Ketse!

156
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,799
Ketse!

157
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,039
Ketse!

158
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,159
- Ketse what?
- Ketse.

159
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,159
Ketse.

160
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,759
I think he wants a match.

161
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,720
- Want a match?
- Ketse!

162
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,759
Here.

163
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,279
Koo?

164
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
- The whole box?
- Koo!

165
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,039
First take us out of here,
then we'll give you koo.

166
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
Not a single letter,
not a single ''made in''.

167
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,920
Koo!

168
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,639
- Sorry, I don't understand.
- Koo!

169
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,160
Sprechen Sie Turkish?

170
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,680
Ku!

171
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,839
Koo.

172
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,399
What do they want?

173
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,879
They want koo.

174
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,599
Tsak.

175
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,839
Thank you.

176
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Tsak.

177
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,919
He wants me
to put on the bell.

178
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,440
He'll do without.

179
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
Tsak.

180
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,279
Tsak.

181
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,680
It's not nice. I'll put it on.

182
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,279
Go ahead.

183
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Tsak!

184
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,319
Tsak!

185
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,639
Tsak!

186
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Tsak!

187
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,120
All right, you've talked me in.

188
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,279
Jingle! Jingle!

189
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,839
Koo!

190
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,920
Koo!

191
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,519
- Koo.
- Koo.

192
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,079
Koo.

193
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,319
Koo.

194
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
Koo.

195
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,079
Koo!

196
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,399
Koo.

197
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,720
Koo.

198
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,920
I want a smoke, let me pass.

199
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,159
- Ketse! Ketse!
- Easy, easy!

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,279
Ketse!

201
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,440
Vladimir Nikolayevich, perhaps
after all, we're on...

202
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,559
Yeah, they're typical Martians.

203
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,559
Ku!

204
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,919
Oh, dear Lyusia, damn you,
what did you need those macaroni for?

205
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,160
Well...

206
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,039
So we know Russian?

207
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,400
Why were you hiding that?

208
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880
We're not hiding anything.

209
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,759
It's hard to dig in a language when
you think in two languages at once.

210
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,000
And this patsak speaks languages
he doesn't know how to continue.

211
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,159
What are you staring at,
maimuno verishvilo?

212
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,400
- They know Georgian too.
- What did he say?

213
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,519
- Monkey, son of a donkey.
- All right...

214
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,759
We're from the Soviet Union,
here on a cultural exchange program.

215
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,160
Our people know where we are, they're
looking for us.

216
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,279
If you don't give us the opportunity
to get in touch with our embassy,

217
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,559
you'll be in big trouble.

218
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
- You got it?
- Tsak.

219
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
Koo.

220
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,120
We don't understand ''embassy''.
Put on the tsak, quick.

221
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,720
So you understand macaroni,
you understand maimuno,

222
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,319
and what the embassy is,
you don't know, poor things.

223
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,519
Don't you bullshit us, all right?

224
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,160
You were thinking about macaroni,
and I just said it.

225
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
It's not Earth, and not Africa, my dear.

226
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,960
This is the Planet Plyuk.

227
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,519
215 in the Tentura.

228
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,639
Galaxy ''Kin-Dza-Dza''
in the Spiral, all right?

229
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
There we go. Just great!

230
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,760
Put on the bell, my dear.

231
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,240
Put it on.

232
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,159
There you go... Good boy.

233
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,160
Koo!

234
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,360
Excuse me, where have we landed?

235
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,880
He got very keen ears.
You know the tentura of your planet?

236
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,399
The tentura?

237
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,039
Well, tell me the number
of your galaxy in the spiral.

238
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,079
- In the spiral?
- Yes.

239
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,160
You know where Earth is?
It's where planets spin, such as...

240
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
Venus, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter.

241
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,440
What other planets?

242
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
The Great Bear.

243
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,480
Vladimir Nikolayevich, come here.

244
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,200
Do you have more matches
on your planet?

245
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,839
We'll find some.

246
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,920
How many will you give us
if we lay you there?

247
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,879
- How many do you need?
- Two full boxes like this.

248
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,079
- Seven.
- Seven.

249
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,160
And give me what you've got now.
I'll buy a gravitsappa for them.

250
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,599
Excuse me, what is gravitsappa?

251
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,480
Gravitsappa is without what a pepelats
can fly only like this,

252
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,839
and with a gravitsappa it can fly to
anywhere in the universe in 5 seconds.

253
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:45,879
Guys, how do you roll the pepelats out
of the garage without a gravitsappa?

254
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,039
We had a gravitsappa, but after we flew
in here, it was stolen.

255
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,080
Don't you have the machine
for moving over in space?

256
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,559
- No.
- No.

257
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,319
Give me the matches.

258
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,240
Give me the water.

259
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,480
- Ku!
- Ku!

260
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,120
- Ku!
- Ku!

261
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,399
Like this! You should do like this!
You should do it like this! Like this!

262
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,799
It's yours. Smoke like this now.

263
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,519
- Thanks.
- Koo!

264
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,160
Koo!

265
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,079
He says he has a gravitsappa.

266
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
Put the matches here.

267
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,759
When you lay us on Earth,
you'll get this and this.

268
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,759
What?

269
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,200
Let's go, violinist,
into outer space.

270
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,480
Wait!

271
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,200
Give it back.

272
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,919
- Give it back!
- You'll get it on our Mother Earth.

273
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,440
Vladimir Nikolayevich, you said if we
got you there you'd give us everything.

274
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,159
And you stole our match.

275
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,279
A patsak never cheats on a patsak.
It's not nice, my dear.

276
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,119
I said, to town.

277
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,359
- And what is this?
- A barn.

278
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,960
And what is this?

279
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,639
And what is this?

280
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,879
And what is this? Isn't it a town?

281
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,680
Stop jerking.

282
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,480
Show us your gravitsappa.
If it's a quality product, we'll take it.

283
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,639
Patsak!

284
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,519
What idiots would take contraband
goods in front of witnesses,

285
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,039
when you can get for it
a life etsikh with nails?

286
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,480
What have you got in your head: brains
or ku?!

287
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,360
We'll buy it ourselves. Let's go.

288
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,960
Halt!

289
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,000
Halt, I said!

290
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,319
Who are you?

291
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,000
Who are you, I'm asking?

292
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,679
- An alien foreman.
- No! You're a patsak!

293
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,960
- And who are you?
- I'm a Georgian.

294
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,639
No, you're a patsak, too!

295
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
You're a patsak, you're a patsak,
and he's a patsak.

296
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,079
And I'm a chatlian, and they're
chatlians.

297
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,079
So put the tsak on
and sit in the pepelats, all right?

298
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,720
What?

299
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,480
Look at me with the visor, dear.
Which dot is responding?

300
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,000
The green one.

301
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,840
Now look at him.

302
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
Green, too.

303
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,920
Yours is green, too.

304
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,440
Now look at Uef.
What dot is it? Orange.

305
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,160
Because he's a chatlian.

306
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,279
Understand now?

307
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,759
- What?
- Plyuk is the chatlian planet.

308
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,640
That's why we, patsaks,
must wear tsaks.

309
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:00,359
And before us, chatlians,
one must do like this!

310
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,600
Vladimir Nikolayevich,
this is a flagrant racism.

311
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,720
Show me once again.

312
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Like this!

313
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,720
- Do me a favor, slower.
- Like this!

314
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,959
Vladimir Nikolayevich, you got a wife
at home, a D-pupil son.

315
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,799
You haven't paid up
for your cooperative apartment.

316
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,079
And you're bullshitting us here.

317
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,200
You may end up bad, my dear.

318
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,160
Here!

319
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,919
All right, violinist,
let's play their games.

320
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,480
Good boy. Now give the match to Uef,
and he'll buy the gravitsappa.

321
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,679
- He said he wanted all of them.
- I was kidding.

322
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,519
You're jolly fellows.

323
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,400
- Koo!
- Wait.

324
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,359
Koo! We'll go together.

325
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,720
Don't show them your ketses
and don't think about them.

326
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Show my ketse and don't
give them more than a half match.

327
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,080
The gravitsappa costs a half match.

328
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,680
And your patsak said it cost a whole
match.

329
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,280
He was kidding too.

330
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,079
The cement is of the 300 grade.

331
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,160
Remember, patsak,
a half or even less.

332
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,039
All right.

333
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,039
Excuse me, chatlians and patsaks,
is it a nationality?

334
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,480
No.

335
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,599
- A biological factor?
- No.

336
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,159
- Persons from other planets?
- No.

337
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,599
And what's the difference
between them?

338
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,120
Are you a color-blind person? Can't
you tell green color from orange?

339
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,720
Some tourist!

340
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,119
A skyscraper.

341
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,599
Come on!

342
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,000
Koo?

343
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,800
Koo! Do as I told you.

344
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,079
Hi, Miss.
Aren't you cold in your coat?

345
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,799
They won't let me in.
They only let you go.

346
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,720
Don't give them the ketse. Bring
the gravitsappa here, I'll look at it.

347
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,759
Go.

348
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,920
Not you.

349
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
- We're together.
- No.

350
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Vladimir Nikolayevich, tell him!

351
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,279
All right.

352
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
Wait here.

353
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,000
But don't go anywhere.

354
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,519
Hi!

355
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,839
How you doing?

356
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,279
You want me to sit down?

357
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,079
Well, as a courtesy
to the ladies present.

358
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,119
Well, what's new on Plyuk?

359
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,880
Put down the ketse, you'll get
the gravitsappa.

360
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,759
A half.

361
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,000
A half.

362
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,360
- May I have a look?
- Look.

363
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,240
Well, I'm not an expert
on those gravitsappas.

364
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,439
Let's go and show it to
my chatlian, he'll check it.

365
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,120
We'll put the tsapa in.

366
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,119
A sore throat?

367
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,640
Water.

368
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,159
I have a suggestion:
I give you the rest of the ketse,

369
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,240
you give me two bottles of water.

370
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,240
All right.

371
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,320
Got any food?

372
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,160
Porridge.

373
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,880
What kind?

374
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,160
Plastic.

375
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,199
All right, I give you
this whole ketse,

376
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,360
you give me five bottles of water

377
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,080
and a kilo of porridge.

378
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,719
- What's this?
- Ketse.

379
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,000
- Have to check it again.
- Check it.

380
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,040
Koo!

381
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,440
Hey, just a second!

382
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,080
Wait.

383
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,920
Violinist, can you
get matches on Earth?

384
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,360
Yes, I can.

385
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,839
If you spit farther,
I'll give you a half chatl.

386
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,480
Here.

387
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,119
With this plyuk. If I spit
farther, you'll give me two matches.

388
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,240
- Understand?
- No.

389
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,880
A very simple game.

390
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,760
I give you a half chatl, you give me
three matches on Earth. Here!

391
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,679
- Spit, son.
- I don't want to.

392
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,960
All right, you give me one match,

393
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,519
and I give you 3 chatls, yellow
pants and this big head start.

394
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,280
- Come on.
- No.

395
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,480
- Blue pants.
- No, I will do it on no conditions.

396
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,640
Is it your rear word?

397
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
Why are you
snowjobbing me, then?

398
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,039
Maimuna verishvila!

399
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,239
Mister Uef, I'm a representative
of a civilized planet.

400
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,280
And I demand that
you watch your vocabulary!

401
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:49,000
Where are they?

402
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,559
- Who?
- The one with a scar.

403
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,599
I, the idiot, gave him all the matches.

404
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
Ku!

405
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,240
Ku!

406
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,960
Ku!

407
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Stop it, guys, enough.

408
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
Enough! What's enough?

409
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,519
I've told him a thousand times
we have to fly to the center.

410
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,920
But he's as greedy as all chatlians!

411
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,519
Two chatls cheaper! Ku!

412
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,920
We got one more.

413
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,519
As far as I understand,
it's enough for a gravitsappa.

414
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,320
Give it here.

415
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,400
- Why?
- To buy a gravitsappa.

416
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,600
Where?

417
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,440
Over there, at the center.

418
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,639
How can you carry us
to Mother Earth

419
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,039
if you even don't know
in which galaxy it spins?

420
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,480
Any planetarium at the center, idiot,

421
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,679
will give us the number of your planet
for two chatls.

422
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,680
Give me the match, come on!

423
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,159
And then you'll bury us in sand,
right?

424
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,759
- So you're not giving it?
- No.

425
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,880
Is that your rear word?

426
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,599
It can't be any rearer.

427
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,320
Then farewell, my dear.

428
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,800
They'll fly away.

429
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,279
They'll be back. They'll cut
each other's throats for a match.

430
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,480
Either you're giving us
this match right now,

431
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,400
or we won't lay you on Earth
for less than 7 matchboxes.

432
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,280
Two thousand.

433
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,800
Three.

434
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,000
Twenty three hundred.

435
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,800
Three.

436
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,359
Twenty five hundred,
I can't give any more.

437
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,199
You can, my dear.

438
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,920
Mister Bi.

439
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,679
I've got 50 rubles.

440
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,320
The price of matches is 2 kopecks a box.

441
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,559
Therefore, I can buy
twenty five hundred.

442
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,200
The violinist is cheating,
he got more chatls.

443
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:40,359
Mister Uef, I'm not a violinist to you.
My name is Gedevan Alexandrovich.

444
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,880
Is the engine there?

445
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,360
Don't poke your nose into every hole,
Gedevan Alexandrovich.

446
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,840
Gedevan, let's tie these jerks up
and head north.

447
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,920
Why?

448
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,119
Who knows, perhaps the Mediterranean
is lapping over there.

449
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,599
Are you off your rocker, my dear?
How can Plyuk have any seas?

450
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,400
They'd been made into luts long ago.

451
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,480
Excuse me, into what?

452
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,880
Into fuel, violinist, into fuel.

453
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,760
- Here. You owe us 6,140 matchboxes.
- Why so many?

454
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,000
You gobbled the porridge, you drink
the water. Plus the contraption.

455
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:43,279
Cross the contraption out, we're not
taking the contraption. Put it down.

456
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,159
Let's take it. At least we'll
bring back some technology.

457
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,880
Otherwise they won't believe us.

458
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,880
Then give him the violin,
if you want it so much.

459
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,280
The violin is Italian. 18th century.

460
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,359
It costs 1 ,000 rubles, if not more.
How am I going to pay for it?

461
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,880
Koo?

462
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,440
Koo.

463
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,880
Violinist, instead of
thinking all the time

464
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,239
that you're the first Georgian cosmonaut

465
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:22,759
and that you'll get
a Nobel Prize,

466
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,840
give back the spoon
you stole from the destitute artists.

467
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,960
I was thinking nothing of the sort.

468
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,880
I wanted to give it to the Institute of
Non-ferrous Metals as something new.

469
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,000
O heavens!

470
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The heavens have never seen such
an ignominious patsak as you, violinist.

471
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,119
It grieves me deeply.

472
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,359
- Where're you going?
- To the toilet.

473
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,039
You can't go to the toilet with money.
Leave the money here,

474
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,119
Gedevan Alexandrovich.

475
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,039
- The ketse's very expensive, my dear.
- Why?

476
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,639
How do you figure it out on your
Earth who before whom

477
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,559
should sit down and how many times?

478
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,720
Well, just by eye.

479
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,640
Savages.

480
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,000
Look, I sort of like you,
so I'll teach you.

481
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,279
If I have a few ketses,

482
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,039
I have the right
to wear yellow pants

483
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,879
and a patsak must sit down before me
not one, but two times.

484
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,360
If I have many ketses,

485
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,639
I have the right
to wear crimson pants

486
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,240
and then a patsak must sit down
before me two times,

487
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:33,480
and a chatlian must do koo,

488
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:38,359
and an etsilopp has no right
to beat me at night.

489
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:40,360
Never!

490
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,079
I have a suggestion, my dear.

491
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,039
You give us the match now

492
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,800
and we'll bring you yellow
pants later, all right?

493
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,440
Thanks, I've got them already.
Perhaps the violinist needs them?

494
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,039
Violinist, those aliens are pushing
black market pants here!

495
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,480
Yellow! You want some?

496
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,199
The violinist is not here, my dear.

497
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
- What do you mean?
- I've ejected him.

498
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,559
Don't worry, Vladimir Nikolayevich,
we got another catapult, a new one.

499
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,599
The old one was not good anyway.

500
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,320
I beg your pardon?

501
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,199
I pressed the kapa, and he flew away.

502
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,519
We don't need the violinist, dear.
He just eats up fuel.

503
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,280
Turn it back.

504
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,840
We can't.

505
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:41,599
We're out of luts,
we have to fly to a luts station.

506
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,120
Turn it back!
Or I'll burn this ketse to hell!

507
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,799
Gedevan!

508
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,280
Violinist!

509
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,160
Violinist!

510
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,200
- Where can he be?
- I've told you.

511
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,799
He was caught by the etsilopps.

512
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:24,359
- Let's fly, dear.
- Death would be too good for you!

513
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:31,480
Radio the etsilopps.

514
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,720
We don't have a radio.
We threw it out.

515
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,920
- I'll check it.
- An etsilopp!

516
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:49,000
Put on the tsak.

517
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:52,840
Put on the tsak!

518
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,680
He'll do without.

519
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,720
Koo!

520
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,280
Koo.

521
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,600
Put it on. He'll trankluate
both you and the match.

522
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,160
Koo.

523
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,240
Koo!

524
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,000
Hello.
Look, friend, we've lost our boy.

525
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,039
- Haven't you seen him?
- Koo.

526
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:14,840
What?

527
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,760
Koo! Sorry, I forgot.
They say you picked him up.

528
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,200
Koo.

529
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,599
Didn't I tell we don't need
the violinist? Didn't I?!

530
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,840
What are we going to buy luts with now?

531
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,120
With what?!

532
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,440
What a bastard you are, dear.

533
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:29,920
He's even worse, he's just a ku!

534
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,280
I have a suggestion.

535
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:11,559
We'll find the violinist and
fly to the local government.

536
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,559
Bring some sand, dear.

537
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,279
We'll tell them who we are and
from where.

538
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,039
They'll give us a gravitsappa.

539
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,200
And we...

540
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,359
will make
a mutually profitable trade-in.

541
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:35,639
You'll give us yellow pants, we'll
give you as many ketses as you want.

542
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,359
To fly to the government,
you need to have a gravitsappa.

543
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,960
The government lives
on another planet, dear.

544
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,639
Uncle Vova, I'm here!

545
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,600
Here!

546
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,360
- Violinist!
- What?

547
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:54,480
- Where's my... what's its name...
- Tsak?

548
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:57,880
Well?

549
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,360
- I got it.
- Then give it to me.

550
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:04,199
- What do you need it here for?
- Give it to me, I said.

551
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,039
There's no one here.

552
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:14,359
- This is mine.
- Keep it ready.

553
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,240
Are you sleeping?

554
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,080
No.

555
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,000
Cheer up.

556
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,519
If there's a gravitsappa on this Plyuk,
we'll get it.

557
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,239
We used to get even more valuable things.

558
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:54,440
Stay cool.

559
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,360
Hey, stop!

560
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,280
Koo!

561
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,960
Give us a lift to the center!

562
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,240
- Stop, patsak.
- What?

563
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,960
Don't come closer.

564
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,199
- What do you want?
- Take us to the center.

565
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,800
Three chatls.

566
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,720
No money.
But we'll work for it.

567
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:21,679
What can you do?

568
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,639
- Me? I can do anything.
- Exactly?

569
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,680
Vladimir Nikolayevich is
a builder, a foreman.

570
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,159
We'll build you a house!

571
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:34,239
And what can you do?

572
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,280
Me?

573
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:39,359
He can play the violin!

574
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:42,000
Play.

575
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,239
- Play.
- I can't play.

576
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,240
Bye, patsaks.

577
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,720
Wait, Miss, I can play!

578
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,280
Play.

579
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,040
Here?

580
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:58,960
Over there!

581
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,200
Wait, I'll put on the sound.

582
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:29,800
Play.

583
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:35,440
And sing.

584
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,120
Just a minute!

585
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:44,440
How does it go...

586
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,159
Mama, mama, what am I to do?

587
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,640
Super!

588
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,840
- What?
- I say, super.

589
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:56,480
People like it.

590
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:59,519
- What?
- People like it.

591
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,720
No.

592
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:22,039
- Let me play the drums.
- Like what?

593
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,280
Foreman.

594
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,519
We don't need the violinist.

595
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:35,559
He may come handy.
Give us some water to drink.

596
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,280
I said, after the performance.

597
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,800
We could have just taken it.

598
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,400
By force.
Then you would've begged for it.

599
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,120
If you touch me, an etsilopp will
fly in and pull your legs out.

600
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,640
- I fuck your etsilopp.
- Cool it, violinist.

601
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,400
Don't irritate the lady.

602
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,720
Foreman.

603
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:22,000
I got you, got you.

604
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:23,880
Got you.

605
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,519
Look, do you know someone
with a gravitsappa and a pepelats?

606
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,040
Why?

607
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,000
He could lay us on Earth. We'd give
a crate of ketse to you and to him.

608
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:39,679
I know you don't believe words.
What am I thinking now?

609
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:45,960
That your wife calls all the morgues.

610
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,759
No, what am I thinking right this moment?

611
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,800
- That you'll give.
- So it's true.

612
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,200
What idiot on Plyuk would think
the truth?

613
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,680
It's absurd.

614
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,920
Yes, because you
say what you don't think

615
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,440
and think what you don't think,

616
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,359
that's why you sit in cages,

617
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,000
and that's why all this
wretched cataclysm

618
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:17,879
that I'm observing here,
and Vladimir Nikolayevich, too.

619
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,960
You were told that patsaks should
perform in a cage, so it must be a cage.

620
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,759
Why showing off?

621
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,479
It's all right, dear,
we can sing just next to it.

622
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,000
Get in. He's nabbed us.
He's trankluating.

623
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:31,519
We're not beasts.

624
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,040
What?!

625
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,280
- Yes, you will get in!
- Let go! Let go!

626
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,080
Ku!

627
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,800
Koo!

628
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,279
Get in, or he'll melt us!

629
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:52,599
All right, let's come in, violinist,
as long as they're begging.

630
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:55,400
Get in.

631
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
One... two... three.

632
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,600
Dance!

633
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,040
Dance.

634
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:11,159
Find yourself another pop group, jerk!

635
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:14,360
What?!

636
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:26,920
I'll be right back.

637
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,599
We have to split. Boys, give a push
to the cart, there's a rise here.

638
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:37,879
That we're always ready to do.

639
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,080
Step on it.

640
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,640
Bye.

641
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,200
Vermin.

642
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,639
I'm going to tell everybody

643
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:17,519
to what state that clown, Pezhe,
has reduced the planet!

644
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,880
Patsaks are bossing chatlians around!

645
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,480
Ku!

646
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,000
What?

647
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,320
- Everything's in there?
- She stole the perfume.

648
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,600
A woman.

649
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,720
Let me.

650
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,159
- You got lead in there or what?
- Let me carry it, Uncle Vova.

651
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,360
I don't even know which way
to look. Where's Earth?

652
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,119
Galina Borisovna, as patsaks,
comrade Mashkov and I

653
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,840
could get two chatls for
a performance, that's the maximum.

654
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,880
Water, luts and fines to etsilopps, -
that made up at least a chatl a day.

655
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,000
And the gravitsappa costs a half ketse,
which amounts to 2,200 chatls.

656
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:16,039
We divide it by 365, subtract Saturdays
and Sundays, and we get 6.

657
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,559
So I just couldn't come back
any sooner than in 6 years.

658
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,079
That's all very well, Gedevan
Alexandrovich, but it's just words.

659
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,280
Where's the proof
that you came from outer space,

660
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,360
and notjust sold the violin,
as Professor Rogozin claims,

661
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,199
and operated all that time
at a disco in Gagry?

662
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,720
Here's the mineral.

663
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:39,880
Here's the chatl.

664
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,160
Here's the tsak.

665
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,559
As for pebbles and sand, I enclosed
them with my explanatory note

666
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,720
and handed to Raya in the dean's office,
for her to send it to UNESCO.

667
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,000
- Where?
- To UNESCO.

668
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:58,839
You're a grownup man,
Gedevan Alexandrovich.

669
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,559
You finished one semester
and then disappeared for years.

670
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,000
Now you show up with a rock,

671
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:10,319
with a fragment
of the Caucasian ceramics

672
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,000
and a fishing bell.

673
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:14,959
And you're claiming that...

674
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,280
Besides,
if you can play music,

675
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,560
why didn't you take part
in our amateur talent shows?

676
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,000
Excuse me, violinist,
but this is an elementary koo!

677
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:31,319
End of Part One
