Air! Everyone, head for shelter!

25
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,639
Air!

26
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,199
- Why did you change?
- What are you talking about?

27
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,240
Why did you change your clothes,
you fasсist? Why’d you change?

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,879
Just leave me alone.

29
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,199
Hit the dirt! Fasсists.
They’ve got us surrounded! Run for it!

30
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,120
- Give me back my rifle.
- Get back!

31
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,960
Why’d you change clothes, fasсists?
I recognize all of you anyway.

32
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,599
Why’d you change clothes?!
I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you all!

33
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,439
He almost caused a panic, the rat.

34
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,239
Take him away.

35
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,920
Lieutenant! Are you shell-shocked
or something?

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
No, sir. Lieutenant Ogarkov,
assigned to the 114th division.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,399
Do you have a weapon?

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,959
Yes.

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,680
- Here.
- Is it loaded?

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,600
- Yes, sir, it’s loaded.
- Then why didn’t you shoot?

41
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,879
The evacuation will end at 5 PM.

42
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,639
- You’ll answer for this personally.
- Yes, sir!

43
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,299
Do you know why there aren’t
any craters from shells in the road?

44
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,979
Why?

45
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,540
Fritz’s orders - don’t bomb
the roads or highways.

46
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,699
Then they can use them themselves.

47
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,759
Comrade officers! You need to leave
immediately for your divisions

48
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,520
and deliver these orders.

49
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,079
Thousands, even tens of thousands
of lives depend on you!

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Ogarkov?! Our divisions are next
to each other.

51
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,759
We can ride together
as far as Pavlovsky farm.

52
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,439
Yes? I’ll get the horse.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
Look over there.

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,519
- What’s your name?
- Sergey.

55
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,439
- Why don’t you have an orderly?
- They didn’t give me one.

56
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,159
How can a communications
officer get by without an orderly?

57
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,879
Say something happens to you
on the road, who will help you,

58
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,319
make a report to your superior officer?
You head to the right here.

59
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,040
See you.

60
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Look lively, hold your position.

61
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,920
Turn around - more to the left.
That’s it.

62
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,639
Let’s go, guys.

63
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,719
- Is this Aprelevka?
- No!

64
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,239
- Do you know where the 341st division is?
- What division, damn it?

65
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
The Germans have broken through
our defense. Get out of here!

66
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,439
Dig in deeper, deeper. Don’t slack off.

67
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
Comrade Captain, I’m a communications
officer. I have an order,

68
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,400
I need to deliver it to the division.

69
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,359
Look here, we are here.

70
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
The Germans broke through here.

71
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,719
The division you need
is located in this area.

72
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,559
There’s nothing else I can tell you.

73
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,320
Belousov! Damn you, I told you
to the left! Well, that’s the direction.

74
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,720
- Sir!
- Bring those branches over here.

75
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,799
Brace the mounts!

76
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,279
Tanks from the right!

77
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,759
Turn your weapon around!

78
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,600
Aim for the one in front.

79
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,319
Take your positions.

80
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,120
- Set your sights at 20.
- Shell.

81
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,480
Аn armor-piercing shell. Load!

82
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,679
Fire!

83
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,199
More to the left,
Belousov, damn you!

84
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,519
Why are you sprawled out!
Load.

85
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,639
Load! Fire. Fire, I said!

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,639
Aim constant. Three rounds,
continuous fire.

87
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,120
Go higher, higher, damn it!

88
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,959
Load!

89
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,399
No retreat!

90
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
Back!

91
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,439
Back, I said.

92
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,720
Go back, damn it!

93
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,120
Why are you lying here!?
Germans! Run, run!

94
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,120
Back, I said! Back everyone!

95
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,519
Back, I said!
You’ll all be court marshalled.

96
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,759
Bitches, back I said! Cowards!

97
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,279
Back! Back!

98
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
Your full name.

99
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,840
- Ogarkov, Sergey Leonidovich.
- Age?

100
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,719
- Twenty years.
- Rank?

101
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,840
- Lieutenant.
- Position?

102
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,399
Communications Officer at
the staff headquarters of the Army.

103
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,959
Education?

104
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,079
Ten years in school,
then the military chemical college.

105
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,519
Did you know what order you
were taking to the division?

106
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,519
- Yes.
- I'm talking about its content.

107
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,320
Did you know the content of the order?

108
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,480
- Yes, sir!
- Then why didn’t you deliver it?

109
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,799
Well, I couldn’t get through to them.

110
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,679
There were tanks, well,
many German tanks.

111
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,559
And the division had probably
crossed over beyond the river.

112
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,919
I don’t know, and I couldn’t
get through to them.

113
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,879
Who was your father, Ogarkov?

114
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,280
Why was? He’s still alive.

115
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,159
He’s an engineer. At a factory
in Gorky. Why the past tense?

116
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
Ogarkov and I split up
near the Pavlovsky farm.

117
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,399
- How was he acting?
- A bit cowardly.

118
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,079
But I thought it was a lack
of experience, he’s still young.

119
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,719
- And how old are you?
- Twenty-two.

120
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,879
They hadn’t given him an orderly.

121
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,600
Still, he was a bit cowardly. After all,
he was right by the staff of the division.

122
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,799
Tonight the enemy broke through
our defenses in a few places.

123
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,000
A move to the rear is complicated
by the loss of the communication.

124
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,199
Orders for the re-deployment
were sent to all divisions.

125
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,639
As for the 341st division...

126
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,039
It seems we’ve lost them.

127
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,320
Seryozha!

128
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,240
Seryozha!

129
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,199
What are you up to, you scamp?
What did I say about coming here?

130
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,079
Having considered
the investigation materials

131
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,720
and heard the explanations
of the accused and witnesses,

132
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,279
The Military tribunal decrees:

133
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,279
For exhibiting cowardice,
desertion and betraying the oath,

134
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,279
we sentence former Red Army
lieutenant Ogarkov Sergey Leonidovich,

135
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,279
in accordance with statute 193,

136
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,580
to the highest extent of the law –
death by firing squad.

137
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:29,019
Corporal Dzhurabaev, strip the condemned
man of the signs of his rank.

138
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,840
Come on out.

139
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
Come on, what are you waiting for?

140
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,199
Take off your coat, you won’t need it.

141
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,480
Comrade Lieutenanat,

142
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,200
and maybe this at the same time?

143
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,840
No rush.

144
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,720
Hands behind your back.

145
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,320
Get a move on. Go.

146
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
Go in.

147
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,440
Hey! Open up.

148
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,600
I’ve got something to say.

149
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
Hey, open up. I’ve got...
I need to explain something to them.

150
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,279
Hey.

151
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,720
Open up.

152
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
Open up. I need to explain...

153
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,000
Open up, I need to explain it all.

154
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,639
Open up!

155
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,519
You don’t have the right.
I’m a Soviet citizen. Do you hear?

156
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
Hey, brother,

157
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,119
are you here?

158
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,920
Stop. Who goes there?

159
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,599
Comrade, I need to give
the condemned a copy of the sentence.

160
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,800
I’m the secretary of the tribunal.

161
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,040
The corporal of the guard
must be with you.

162
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,319
The corporal of the guard is
at staff headquarters in the village.

163
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,680
Don’t you know who I am?

164
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,280
The corporal of
the guard must be with you.

165
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,279
Svetochka, what brings you here?

166
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,920
That guard of yours.
He’s a complete idiot. A dolt!

167
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,519
That’s the way he is.

168
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,480
Woudn’t let his own mother through.
Right, Dzhurabaev?

169
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,720
I need to give you a copy of the sentence.

170
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,639
Here, take it

171
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,160
and sign for it.

172
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
There.

173
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,680
Thank you.

174
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,319
Listen, don’t worry,

175
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,880
there’s still hope because the Military
council has to confirm the conviction.

176
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,240
They can’t enforce it otherwise.

177
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,560
Maybe you’d like to write a letter?

178
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,200
I’ll mail it for you.

179
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,599
I didn’t bring the convict any grub,

180
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,000
cause I figured they would’ve already…

181
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,440
Dzhurabaev,

182
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,119
- your boots aren’t too tight are they?
- No.

183
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,160
As you wish. Or I could try
to rustle you up some new ones.

184
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,160
No.

185
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,759
The conviction must be confirmed
at the Army staff headquarters.

186
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,399
Do you hear?

187
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,000
If anything happens to this man,
you’ll answer for it.

188
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,079
You see, Dzhurabaev.

189
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,160
You’ve got quite
the reputation for being sombre.

190
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,279
Go on.
I’ll bring you relief in the evening.

191
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
Guard the convict like he’s the apple
of your eye, got it?

192
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,680
Sveta, please, sit down.
He’s just a sentry.

193
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,000
He’s the kind who would
take him out and kill him.

194
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,451
What? No.

195
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:57,309
You know, I’m always worried about you.

196
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,269
You women shouldn’t be here
in the war, you understand?

197
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,309
This war, they’d shoot you and
wouldn't even notice that you're a girl.

198
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,029
They’re fascists, after all.
You understand?

199
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:32,869
Get out.

200
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,190
Move.

201
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,549
Move, move!

202
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:17,349
Stop!

203
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:35,430
Just shoot me already!

204
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,990
We’re leaving!

205
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,309
- Give me your rifle.
- No.

206
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,630
- Give me your rifle.
- No, it’s forbidden.

207
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,110
- No.
- I’ll shoot him.

208
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,470
Let’s leave.

209
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,589
Let’s leave.

210
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,870
Go to sleep already.

211
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:25,069
I won’t run off, I promise.

212
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:33,029
- Why don’t you say anything?
- Because you’re the enemy.

213
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,029
Ogarkov!

214
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:20,190
Stop! Lower your weapon.

215
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,389
Who are you? Your documents.

216
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,950
You’re also trying
to get through the blockade?

217
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,190
You’ll go under my command.

218
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:38,709
- No, It’s forbidden.
- Why?

219
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,549
I’ve got orders. We’re to go
to Army headquarters.

220
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,950
Why?

221
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,990
Even rhynos are smarter than you!

222
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:55,509
Why couldn’t we just go with the Captain?

223
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,789
Nobody asked for me to be let go.

224
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:03,429
We could have simply gone with
the Captain, on the same road,

225
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:06,629
side-by-side, in the rain,
but with the Captain

226
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:09,910
who knows the way and how and why.

227
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,470
Any idiot should know the Army staff
headquarters is not in the blockade.

228
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:17,869
Or do you not understand that?
Why don’t you say anything?

229
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,070
Can you understand what I’m saying?

230
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:29,789
Go on, be silent, you dolt.
I’ll escape from you all the same.

231
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:33,349
I’ll knock you out,
take your rifle and run away.

232
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,590
- Go in.
- Sure, sure, of course.

233
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,350
Let’s sit a bit and wait for the Germans.
Close it, sure, close it.

234
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:41,710
You think that’ll keep
me from running away?

235
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,070
You fall asleep and I’m gone, understand?
I’ll dig my way out and run away.

236
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,750
Or maybe through the roof.

237
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:55,629
Go ahead latch the door.
Nail me in,

238
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,710
get a log and barricade me in.
I’ll still run away.

239
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,349
We’ve got to find a place to cross.

240
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,230
Let’s swim across.

241
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,389
No.

242
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,990
What? Can’t you swim?

243
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:06,149
No.

244
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,750
Are you serious? You can’t swim?

245
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,549
He says, I bet you can’t swim across
the Volga. I says, you’re on.

246
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,710
In an hour I was on
the other side. An hour.

247
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,710
And that was the Volga not this…
That was the Volga.

248
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,950
- Do you know how wide the Volga is?
- Quiet.

249
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,789
- A cow.
- Will you kill it?

250
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,070
Why would we kill it?

251
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:23,629
Mom said that the Germans would
come and kill her. Our guys, too.

252
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,189
- And you’ve hidden her here?
- There’s nowhere else.

253
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,670
- I see. Is there a place to ford here?
- No.

254
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:36,149
There used to be a bridge over there,
but the Germans blew it up.

255
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,269
- Any boats?
- There’s a raft.

256
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,590
A raft?

257
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,390
- Would you show us?
- You’re really our guys?

258
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:55,190
Really.

259
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,630
Then maybe you could
take the pilot with you.

260
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,110
He’s wounded in the head and the leg.

261
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,269
We bandaged him up, well Nina did.

262
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,110
Her mom’s a medic.
She knows how to do it.

263
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,230
- Has he been here long?
- Three days already.

264
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,389
He moaned a lot the first day.
We all thought he’d croak.

265
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,389
Mom says that if any Germans find him here

266
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:37,829
they’ll do us all in.

267
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,030
Help me.

268
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,789
This raft won't carry two people.

269
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:52,869
Misha and I tried it once,

270
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:56,429
but it tipped over immediately.

271
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,150
- You know how to do it?
- How?

272
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,710
Put one guy on the raft and
the other will swim alongside holding on.

273
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,110
Then it’ll work.

274
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:12,230
Look. Let’s do it like this.

275
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,750
I’ll go with the pilot,
I’ll take him to the other side.

276
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,230
I’ll leave him there and come back

277
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:24,269
for you,

278
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,269
and together we can cross, OK?

279
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,110
Come on.

280
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,430
What?

281
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,349
You’re afraid I’ll run off?

282
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,190
OK, look.

283
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:52,269
This watch was my Grandfather’s.
My most prize possession.

284
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:56,669
Look, read it. There it says - Ogarkov,
that’s my Grandad. Take it.

285
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,470
That’s it. Let’s go.

286
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,830
You… what?

287
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,030
Yeah, I could run off, only how
then could I drag him there without you?

288
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:14,949
Do you get it?

289
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,990
Or do you think that
I’d leave him there?

290
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,990
You think I’d leave him?

291
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,829
Well, say something. Answer me!

292
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,909
He’s ours, isn’t he? Isn’t he ours?

293
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:37,829
The current carried us away.

294
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,670
Come on.

295
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,510
Stop, stop!

296
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,070
They’re ours, they’re ours!

297
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,309
- Our guys…
- Halt! Hands up!

298
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,950
Guys. I’m one of us! Hey, guys,
we’ve got a wounded pilot over there.

299
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,950
Your guy’s in bad shape.
He doesn’t even moan anymore.

300
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:55,589
Guys, help me. Let’s move him.

301
00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:58,829
We’ll tend to the wounded later.

302
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,070
For now, anyone who can
hold a weapon, we’re going to battle.

303
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:04,549
I’ve got my own orders.

304
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,230
Break through the ring and get
the people out with minimal losses.

305
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,510
- Can’t. We’re going to Army headquarters.
- What are you harping on about!

306
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:14,549
The staff headquarters is back
there in the rear! Here I’m in command.

307
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,710
And anyone who can carry
a gun tomorrow is going to fight.

308
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,750
- Comrade…
- Drop it!

309
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:21,670
Attention!

310
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,349
In accordance with directive 2-6-0,

311
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:28,710
you and your prisoner are under
my jurisdiction

312
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,269
until we’ve broken through the blockade.

313
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,870
And then go wherever the hell you want!

314
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,829
- Got it, private?
- Yes, sir.

315
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,230
They’re prepping
the pilot for his operation.

316
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:03,029
They said gangrene has set in.
They’ll have to amputate his leg.

317
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:05,549
- Wanna smoke?
- No, I don’t smoke.

318
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,950
Well, I do.

319
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:16,150
Were you a Komsomolets?

320
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,790
Yeah.

321
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:25,630
Go,

322
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,269
you have to go get your weapon yourself.

323
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,349
We’re going to break through the blockade.

324
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,030
Go.

325
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,750
Here, take it, soldier,

326
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:12,710
a rifle sling, a cap, sign for it.

327
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,309
Listen… Sign here?

328
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,670
- Here.
- Don’t you have any boots?

329
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:23,229
No boots. We’ve got foot
cloths and buttons. Need any?

330
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,230
- No.
- Then sorry, buddy.

331
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,190
- Comrade.
- Five… six.

332
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,269
Is your watch any good?

333
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,230
- Like it?
- Yeah.

334
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,510
- It’s a trophy.
- Do you collect them?

335
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:46,549
What of it? I’ve got a right.

336
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,990
- Next.
- And for me more broth, guy.

337
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,750
You want zilch? Move on.
Next.

338
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,269
What’s with your shoe, soldier?

339
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:26,630
You going to attack like that?

340
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,389
Or you do not go in attack?

341
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:32,469
Head over to the supply tent.

342
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:36,750
I’ve got a pair of boots
left in just your size. Run.

343
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,950
We were allocated to the third company.

344
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,950
- We’ll move out soon.
- I’ve got to get boots. Just a minute.

345
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:57,909
Hey, guy. Was it you who brought
the pilot to the infirmary?

346
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,190
- Yes.
- Could I have his parachute?

347
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,430
It’s all torn and covered in blood, it is.

348
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,950
Once he wakes up, ask him.

349
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,830
Well, he…

350
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,349
when he came to after the operation
and saw he didn’t have legs,

351
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,550
he shot himself in the mouth.

352
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,350
Third company!

353
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:18,509
Fall in to two files!

354
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,630
So what about the parachute?

355
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,389
So what about the parachute?

356
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,550
Faster, double time. Look lively.

357
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,830
Lively!

358
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:50,070
Line up! Attention!

359
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,269
Right face!

360
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,349
Forward march!

361
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,170
To the assault!

362
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,810
Forward! Hoorah!

363
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,170
Forward!

364
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:45,849
- Brother!
- Yeah!

365
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,849
- Hey, brother. Why are you lying here?
- They’ll kill me.

366
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:52,730
Well, so what if they kill you,
it’s war. Get up.

367
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,330
No, they’ll kill me.

368
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,409
If you’re lying down,
they’ll definitely kill you.

369
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,490
Harder to hit a moving target. Get up.

370
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,050
- They’ll kill me.
- Look, I’m standing up, you get up, too.

371
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,769
Load. Fire.

372
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:16,050
- Forward, brothers! Hooray!!!
- Hooray!

373
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:50,170
A sniper!

374
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:12,190
Stop! Where are you going?

375
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,230
Don’t! The sniper will see you and shoot.

376
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,950
- Forward, guys.
- Hooray!

377
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,910
Ogarkov!

378
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:18,670
Ogarkov!

379
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:21,710
Ogarkov, are you alive?

380
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,429
Ogarkov, are you alive?

381
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:49,750
Damn if the directive of
the Soviet tribunal

382
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:52,509
was fulfilled by the Krauts!

383
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,309
I brought him.

384
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,430
Well, about time.

385
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:24,630
So, comrades, lets’ put the artillery
in the background.

386
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:28,630
That’s good.

387
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:32,949
Backup a bit. Now to the left.

388
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:35,150
Ready.

389
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,710
Here we go...

390
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,029
Say cheese.

391
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,349
Got it. When the paper comes out,
I’ll send you the picture.

392
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,349
Thanks. We sure gave it
to them, Captain.

393
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,750
- Well, yeah and how!
- We are fearless people.

394
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,750
You and I are fearless, Dzhurabaev.

395
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:58,150
And you know, everyone who came out
of the encirclement will get medals.

396
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,870
What’s wrong, Dzhurabaev?

397
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,150
We need to go to
the Army staff headquarters.

398
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,650
Ogarkov,

399
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:52,890
Ogarkov,

400
00:54:55,889 --> 00:54:57,170
can you write?

401
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:00,930
Write what?

402
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,610
Can you write a letter?

403
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:08,170
Where?

404
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:12,489
To the staff headquarters?
Wait, we will be with you soon?

405
00:55:13,969 --> 00:55:17,409
No. I need to write home, to my mother.

406
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,610
What do you want to write?

407
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,210
Write that we’re fighting the Germans.

408
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,490
She knows that.

409
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,450
From the war you need
to write something heroic.

410
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,210
What?

411
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,409
Heroic. Say, write that you’re a convoy.

412
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,530
- A what?
- A convoy.

413
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,929
You are conveying me, you are fulfilling
a very important order.

414
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:16,329
No. They’ll think it’s bad, that
I’m serving in a prison, not the front.

415
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:23,289
That’s because you need to write
to your father, not mother.

416
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,250
The father will understand.

417
00:56:26,769 --> 00:56:28,050
My father died

418
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:31,610
at the front.

419
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:34,809
In ’41.

420
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:42,809
Write about the steppe.

421
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:49,210
What?

422
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:57,409
The steppe here looks a lot like at home…

423
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,769
the steppe… and the wind…

424
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:05,090
Comrade soldiers, I’m lieutenant
Prisyazhnyuk, the commandant of the town.

425
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:06,769
Your documents.

426
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:09,969
Again, private Dzhurabaev,
you're free to go.

427
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:12,969
- Head back to your unit.
- Can’t go back. I have an order!

428
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,090
- I need to go to the staff headquarters.
- Back off!

429
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:19,049
- I have more than enough to do!
- Comrade commandant,

430
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,649
the tribunal papers
need to be confirmed.

431
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:25,689
Private Dzhurabaev, I tell you again,
you’ve completed your mission. Go.

432
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,730
Comrade commandant, I can’t.
I’ve got an order.

433
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,650
In conditions of war

434
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,089
I can decide such questions myself. Clear?

435
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,010
Ishenko!

436
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,210
Escort the private to the exit.

437
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,010
Sit down, granny, sit down.

438
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,329
I’ll call you.
I’ve got no time right now.

439
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,930
Go straight ahead.

440
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:02,090
Attention!

441
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:09,769
Ready!

442
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,490
Load!

443
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,690
Aim!

444
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:24,449
- Ogarkov! Ogarkov!
- At ease!

445
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,449
Comrade Lieutenant,
I’m to take Ogarkov to the commandant.

446
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:29,850
Who’s Ogarkov?

447
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,530
Aim.

448
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,410
Fire.

449
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:16,710
You now owe your life to your Kazakh.

450
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:19,349
If he hadn’t brought that paper…

451
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,310
Take it.

452
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:25,949
This is your citation for
the order of the Red Star.

453
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:49,710
What happens now?

454
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,429
I don’t know…
Let the staff headquarters decide.

455
01:02:57,949 --> 01:03:00,149
Shoot you or give you the award.

456
01:03:02,269 --> 01:03:03,550
Ishenko!

457
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:07,190
That’s all. Escort him out.

458
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:54,230
What made you decide to save me?

459
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:01,750
You never finished the letter.

460
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:07,549
You don’t smoke.

461
01:04:10,269 --> 01:04:12,230
Yes, I don’t smoke.

462
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:54,909
- Hello.
- There are two of you?

463
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,630
I can find a place for two.

464
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:03,550
Come.

465
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:19,750
Take it.

466
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:27,550
Maria!

467
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,349
Everyone is ours. Here take it.

468
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,630
Maybe you’d like to sleep?

469
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:48,950
No, thank you.

470
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:08,989
My husband was killed last
year right at the beginning.

471
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,190
He was stationed
at the border, in Bessarabia.

472
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:17,750
He was a lot like you,

473
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:20,150
a city boy,

474
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:24,670
from Maikop.

475
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:49,509
- Hello, Aunty Masha.
- Hi.

476
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,950
Here.

477
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,910
- Thank you.
- When you come back -

478
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:51,750
drop by

479
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,709
if you remember.

480
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:19,429
Get up, get up.

481
01:08:19,789 --> 01:08:21,750
- Are you alive?
- Yeah, everything’s OK.

482
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:24,430
Check the personel.

483
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:26,549
Anyone wounded?

484
01:08:27,949 --> 01:08:30,389
A soldier’s wounded. Call the medic.

485
01:08:31,909 --> 01:08:33,189
Get a medic here.

486
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:37,669
- Quick, quick.
- Go away, go away.

487
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:40,949
- Let us help.
- How?

488
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:43,789
Now, now.

489
01:08:44,909 --> 01:08:47,149
Get your hands off him!

490
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:50,390
- Get your hands off him!
- Calm down.

491
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,390
Now, now, now. Hold on.

492
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,909
Give me a rag.

493
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,750
There now, hold on.

494
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,470
I’ll take care of you. Hold on.

495
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:11,109
- Here. Will this work?
- Now, now,

496
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,949
hold on.

497
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,550
Get out.

498
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,470
- Where can I wash my hands?
- I’ll show you.

499
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:35,309
Now, now…

500
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:39,269
- How is he?
- He won’t last an hour.

501
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:41,629
Hold on, hold on…

502
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,990
Boots…

503
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,590
Boots, what?

504
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:47,269
Boots…

505
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,030
- for the German…
- The German… what?

506
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,189
- Boots…
- Boots… Hold on…

507
01:09:58,149 --> 01:10:01,829
- Don’t give them away…
- I won’t give them away… Hold on.

508
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,229
What was his name?

509
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,710
Private Dzhurabaev.

510
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:00,109
And his first name?

511
01:11:11,909 --> 01:11:14,590
You’ve got blood on your tunic.
I’ll wash it for you.

512
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,909
That’s Mikola, our neighbor.

513
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:57,829
He says, he’s not going across the river.

514
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,949
He’s done with fighting.

515
01:13:05,109 --> 01:13:06,989
I found this in your tunic.

516
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,710
Are you Ogarkov?

517
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:16,750
It’s you they’re going to shoot?

518
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:20,269
Yes.

519
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:25,670
And he...

520
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:28,429
he was taking you

521
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:30,869
to be shot?

522
01:13:35,909 --> 01:13:37,189
Yes.

523
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:49,190
Well, so that means now
you don’t need to go there.

524
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,590
Yes, I could choose not to go.

525
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,150
But you’re going anyway?

526
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,029
Yes.

527
01:16:04,909 --> 01:16:06,189
Let’s move!

528
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,229
C’mon, open up!

529
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:44,469
No sleeping, sentry.

530
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,909
- Good health, Comrade lieutenant.
- What?

531
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,029
Don’t you recognize me?

532
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,630
Ogarkov?

533
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,829
So you…

534
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:04,789
How?

535
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:09,429
Are you going to the staff headquarters?

536
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:11,750
Yes.

537
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,110
Then we’re both going the same way.

538
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:17,909
- Well, what’s over there?
- Still don’t know.

539
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:21,070
What’s there to know, geez!
He came himself.

540
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,789
Of his own will. Formalists.

541
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,909
And he fought. In the encirclement.
Did you make the inquiry?

542
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:29,750
I did. Don’t get worked up.

543
01:17:30,069 --> 01:17:31,829
Nobody’s gonna shoot him just yet.

544
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:36,389
I’m coming!

545
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:41,750
I’ll call you from the nearest telephone
station, I’ll find out what’s up.

546
01:17:42,069 --> 01:17:43,829
- You’ll be here?
- Where else would I be?

547
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,869
- Vanya!
- What?

548
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:48,910
He wrote a letter.
He asked to have you mail it.

549
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,750
Germany
1945

550
01:18:54,949 --> 01:18:56,949
- Is it going to be much longer?
- A couple of minutes.

551
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:01,350
Kopylov, you were supposed
to be at your position a half hour ago.

552
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,310
I want everything ready so the column
can head out in five minutes.

553
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,789
- You understand? Carry it out.
- Yes, sir.

554
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:13,029
- Ogarkov.
- Good afternoon, comrade Colonel!

555
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:17,989
So now I'm just a colonel for you?
Don't you recognize me?

556
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,949
Sinyaev!

557
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,750
Hello!

558
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:26,349
I’m so happy to see you, you old devil.

559
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:29,069
I didn’t know what kind
of sentence they’d give you.

560
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,829
I got wounded
and then was in hospital.

561
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,630
Wait! Just a minute, wait.

562
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:40,710
This is the third year
I’ve been carrying it with me.

563
01:19:41,029 --> 01:19:43,590
Kopylov? Look lively.

564
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,229
- Here, take it.
- What’s this?

565
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,029
There inside, look.

566
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,270
Comrade Colonel, everything’s ready.
We can head out.

567
