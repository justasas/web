75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:55,000
wrong with being a good musician you

76
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:57,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have to be great not everybody can</font>

80
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:46,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you just now but music is harsh far</font>

81
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:48,930
these harsh standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> are high and my</font>

82
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:56,159
standards for you and all my students

83
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:59,310

<font color="#E5E5E5">affection sure I understand do you</font>

87
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,519
I think so oh I hope so

88
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:25,490

what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I mean what kind of</font>

300

thoughts go through your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and a</font>

301

beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> peasant girl he had seen just</font>

306
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:12,589
once in passing just once so the music

00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:19,069
expresses love and<font color="#E5E5E5"> parting</font>

308
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:21,638
simultaneously music expresses life play

309
