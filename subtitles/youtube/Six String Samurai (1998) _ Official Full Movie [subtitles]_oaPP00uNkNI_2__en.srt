00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,317
<i>You're listening to K-LOST,
home of the apocalypse.</i>

2
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,686
<i>The call-in question of the day
is "Who will be the new King?"</i>

3
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>I'm sending in an ICBM
across the wasteland</i>

4
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:30,415
<i>for all of you
on the yellow brick road to Vegas</i>

5
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:31,890
<i>looking for a hero.</i>

6
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,351
<i>If you find one,
send him my way, baby !</i>

7
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,751
David!

8
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,093
What?

9
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:33,880
Float away, little butterfly,
just flutter away...

10
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,098
I got a gig in Vegas.

11
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,899
And the wastelands
ain't no place for kids !

12
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,230
He's still there...

13
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:32,860
Cross that line, kid,

14
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,846
I'll cut your little
teddy bear in half !

15
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,206
Last kid that crossed that line,

16
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:42,016
I had to summon up the Spinach
Monster with my rock'n'roll magic.

17
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,626
Spinach monster grabbed him,
pulled him underground,

18
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,199
made him eat spinach all day.

19
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,309
Rumour has it, kid...

20
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,180
He's still there...

21
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:26,274
Alright boys,
we kill him now or later ?

22
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:29,055
- Kill him now...
- Later ?

23
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:32,122
No, we'd better wait till he's drunk...

24
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,358
Nice shoes...

25
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:08,639
Don't touch my guitar, man.
Don't even touch it.

26
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,826
Hollow body six-string...

27
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,592
1957 !

28
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,161
A good year...

29
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:24,121
See those cats over there ?
Those cats are King material...

30
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:28,194
going all the way to Vegas !

31
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:31,063
The only one going
to Vegas around here is me.

32
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:38,923
I know your type, buddy...
You ain't going to Vegas !

33
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:40,254
Where you go,

34
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:45,140
Death follows
like a blown out '52 Plymouth !

35
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:10,904
Top Hat's put a big price
on that guitar, buddy !

36
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:12,640
But maybe you give it to us...

37
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,150
We forget we ever saw you...

38
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:17,641
Come on guys,

39
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,956
pulling night isn't till Tuesday...

40
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:21,604
Who are you foolin' ?

41
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,995
Maybe you were good once...

42
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:27,865
What are you looking at ?

43
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:32,351
But now, everybody knows
you're just a washed up rocker,

44
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,663
who can't tell a six-string
from a shot glass.

45
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:39,283
You're probably
not even worth killing...

46
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,345
but maybe we kill you anyway !

47
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,594
Nice tuxedo...

48
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:57,471
Nice tuxedo to die in !

49
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:02,896
Nobody messes with the Pinpals and
gets away with it ! Nobody !

50
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,552
Yeah... nobody !

51
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:27,458
Pick up the spare...

52
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,146
Should've waited
till I was drunk, Gutterball.

53
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,162
I don't think he's drunk yet...

54
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:12,599
Nice car...

55
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,460
Thanks.

56
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,538
Tag !

57
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,387
You're it !

58
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,342
You gotta be kidding ?

59
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,006
Well ? What are you waiting for ?

60
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,341
Damn !

61
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,669
Guess it's not my day...

62
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:50,410
You're it !

63
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:10,495
Beware the Spinach Monster.

64
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:13,668
See you in hell, boy !

65
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,197
It was him !

66
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,334
He was here...

67
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:22,532
They were my best bowlers.

68
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:26,826
The one with the four eyes
will be hard to defeat.

69
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,009
What's the matter, comrade Death ?

70
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,808
You...

71
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,948
I asked you
to kill one simple guitarist,

72
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,754
and what do I get ?

73
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,826
Dead bald guys...

74
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:46,109
You four have failed me for the last -

75
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,295
Nice shoes...

76
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,995
<i>Another caller, can you dig it ?</i>

77
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,621
<i>We're rockin'n'rollin
ourselves to death !</i>

78
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:03,528
<i>Yeah, Werewolf ? I just saw death</i>

79
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,449
<i>and he's looking for your number !</i>

80
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,844
<i>Well you just tell
that dark ugly dude</i>

81
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:11,067
<i>that my number is
555-Unlisted, baby !</i>

82
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,732
Not bad...

83
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,770
<i>ENTERING NEVADA BADLAND</i>

84
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:48,005
Thanks for the ride, kid !

85
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,760
<i>Here we go, you're on
the air with the Werewolf</i>

86
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:56,839

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,379
<i>Who will be
the next king of rock'n'roll ?</i>

88
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:35,426
<i>Here's one for all
the hopeless romantics,</i>

89
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,791
<i>abandoned and broken hearted
down-and-outs</i>

90
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,001
<i>choking up
that highway to love, baby !</i>

91
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:31,702
Swell...

92
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:34,125
<i>Listen up, baby,
for a word from our sponsors</i>

93
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:37,075
<i>Are you a busy rock warrior ?</i>

94
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:41,675
<i>Are you constantly plagued
by small annoying animals on the path?</i>

95

<i>Call us to round up all your stray cats,

96
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,678
<i>Can you dig it?</i>

97
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:59,251
Sounds like we need a ratchet,
stray cat.

98
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,548
Fire !

99
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:22,093
Why, Arriette !
Look who's come to dinner !

100
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:24,509
Why, it's Wally Fishbinder

101
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:28,308
and his little boy Jed...

102
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,531
How the hell are you boy ?

103
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:34,762
So I suppose you don't have
a ratchet in that bag, right ?

104
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:36,290
How the hell are you boy ?

105
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:40,598
You've finished paying off
that new Plymouth of yours ?

106
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,709
I tell ya,

107
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,824
I sure hope to hell you didn't
go to one of those boys on the lot !

108
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:47,817
They see you coming
a mile away,

109
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:50,286
ready to eat you alive !

110
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:53,667
Those Plymouth dealers will
tell you they're cutting you a break,

111
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:57,174
when all they're doing is just
fattening you up for the slaughter !

112
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,505
All little Rusty can talk about

113
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,537
is riding in the
Fishbinder's new Studebaker!

114
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:07,707
Oh my, Jeddy, you're just
a little weed is what you are !

115
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:11,844
You just get plumper
every time we see you !

116
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:15,223
Come up here sweetie !

117
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,941
You ever try a pink golf ball Wally ?

118
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:23,950
Why, the wind shear
alone on a pink golf ball

119
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:27,468
can take the head
clean off a 90 lb midget

120
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,628
at over 300 yards...

121
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,551
So, you don't have a ratchet.

122
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:37,787
Can I get you anything ?

123
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:40,176
Some coffee ?
Would you like some candy ?

124
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:42,554
Here would you like some candy ?

125
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:46,153
Can I get you anything at all ?
Here, have some candy !

126
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,772
Don't you think
this is a nice family, kid ?

127
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:56,361
Look, they're a little strange but
they're better than what's outside...

128
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:02,003
Rusty's been looking for a new
third base man ! You play, Jedd ?

129
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:05,270
Have some candy...
Here you are !

130
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,071
It'll put some meat
on your bones, slugger!

131
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:24,397
- Bye Bye !
- Bye Bye...

132
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,692
He looks nice and marinated, dear...

133
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:51,893
Slice me off a thigh, honey bunch !

134
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:11,425
Windmill People !
I hate those guys...

135
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:16,605
Phooey ! No breakfast again...

136
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:24,568
Aha! Ratchet...

137
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,815
Nice kitty...

138
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:47,373
Hurry daddy, the wind's picking up !

139
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,363
Hurry daddy, they're getting closer !

140
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:10,514
Hurry home Jedd,
or you'll be late for school !

141
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,086
Watch your back buddy,
there's a storm coming in !

142
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,044
What are you looking at ?

143
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,990
You look up at the sky,
you look down at the ground,

144
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,492
but you don't look
at me, kid ! Got it ?

145
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:26,611
And don't think this means we're
still together kid, cause we're not...

146
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:46,002
<i>..tell me about the new King!</i>

147
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:48,455
<i>This is Death...</i>

148
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,790
<i>Hello ?</i>

149
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:57,780
<i>I'd like to make
a dedication, please ?</i>

150
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:01,753
<i>Yeah, yeah, go ahead baby,

151
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,870
<i>To all the rock'n'rollers out there</i>

152
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:10,689
<i>whose guitar picks shall litter my
path to Vegas to claim my throne...</i>

153
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,019
<i>Soon, Vegas will be destroyed...</i>

154
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,202
<i>and a new song of darkness

<i>Hello ?</i>

156
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,511
<i>Yeah, let me blag this one out
for the duke of the dark side:</i>

157
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,611
<i>Watch out all you rock and roll mortals,
Death is on the line !</i>

158
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:39,697
<i>You got me trembling baby !</i>

159
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:43,920
Dropped something ?

160
00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:52,247
Wonder where I could trade
the kid for a ratchet...

161
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,582
What ?

162
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:09,956
What !?

163
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,079
What, kid !?

164
00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:29,727
<i>Listen up callers, if you're still

00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:04,260
Got a ratchet, little man ?

177
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:06,256
Ain't no more
ratchets here, homie...

178
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,518
Only paradise,
you got a problem ?

179
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,318
I don't want to rub
with you, little man.

180
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:14,798
I just want to drink off that nasty ass
toilet water you're trying to sell...

181
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,129
Man, you didn't come out here
for toilet water...

182
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:19,820
Good point...

183
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:23,001
How are you with kids ?

184
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:24,615
Terrible !

185
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:26,780
Great, you're hired !

186
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:35,105
Now, where can I get a real drink ?

187
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:37,416
Follow the yellow brick road, homie !

188
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:42,771
See you around, kid...
I got a gig in Vegas !

189
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:53,639
Do you think it'll be better in Vegas ?

190
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:56,684
All the same,
wherever you go,

191
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:59,394
it'll always be the same...

192
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,972
So, heard everybody's
after that guitar of yours...

193
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:25,702
What's it worth these days ?

194
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:28,277
Free in a box of Crackerjacks?

195
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,579
Prom tickets ?
A trip to Disneyland ?

196
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,589
A hundred bucks ?

197
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:38,214
You know, we don't get too
many new guys around here...

198
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:42,959
A lot of King wannabees,
on their way to Vegas...

199
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:49,126
Of course, not you.
You're The King, yeah !

200
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:55,628
Exit ? Stage... left.

201
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:23,034
- Do you know who I am ?
- No.

202
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:43,342
Buddy... Death...

203
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:46,054
Well, what do you know ? It talks.

204
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,184
Wait a minute.
What's the rush ?

205
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,773
Let's savour
this rare moment, kid.

206
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:56,951
Hey, four eyes !

207
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:01,847
They say you can kill 200 men

208
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,777
and play a mean six-string
at the same time.

209
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:12,086
Is that really true ?

210
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:17,467
Hey, I'm talking to you, old man !

211
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:25,721
What's the matter ?

212
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,048
You scared ?

213
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:39,019
You don't wanna be like me, kid...

214
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:44,239
Go home, start a family,
get a picket fence.

215
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:49,269
And get a real guitar !

216
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,764
Stop playing around !

217
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:59,512
Now I know how to
defeat the four eyed one...

218
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:04,454
His heart is his weakness.

219
00:45:04,456 --> 00:45:07,044
The boy...

220
00:45:07,244 --> 00:45:11,436
The boy makes him very uncool...

221
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:21,969
Do you like the beach, kid ?

222
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,429
Build sandcastles...

223
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,265
go surfing...

224
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,556
get a tan...

225
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,838
I used to love the beach
when I was a kid.

226
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:49,282
If you see any sea shells,
kid, let me know !

227
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:53,833
What's a beach !?

228
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:01,236
LOST VEGAS
100 MILES

229
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,746
How much... further...?

230
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:28,884
Hey ! Four eyes !

231
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:34,794
I don't have a family...
This is it !

232
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:41,145
Hey ! Turn around !

233
00:46:42,608 --> 00:46:43,989
You're a coward !

234
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:48,130
I gotta get a new gig.

235
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,862
Let somebody else be king.

236
00:48:24,244 --> 00:48:26,659
You can still be a good king.

237
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:27,315
The '56 Chevy Bel Air can kick
a '47 Buick Roadmaster's ass any day,

238
00:49:27,315 --> 00:49:30,298
at least on the
first quarter mile that is...

239
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:37,725
You come all this
way without saying squat,

240
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:39,139
and now you're
trying to tell me a '56 Chevy

241
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:42,212
can beat a '47 Buick
in a dead quarter mile ?

242
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:48,621
I liked you better when
you weren't saying squat, kid.

243
00:49:49,822 --> 00:49:51,022
Go to bed.

244
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,567
Buddy...

245
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:06,990
What ?

246
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,106
I'm afraid of
that Spinach Monster thing.

247
00:52:05,717 --> 00:52:08,873
Hollow body, six-string...

248
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:12,161
1957.

249
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:15,094
I know that sound.

250
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,451
Good shooting, boys.

251
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:34,507
Who are you ?

252
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:35,851
Death.

253
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,090
Cool... you here for me ?

254
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:43,887
You and every other rock'n'roller
out to claim my throne.

255
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:49,077
Give me the guitar
and I’ll let the child go.

256
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:03,018
I hope you guys can play...

257
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:16,434
Stop him !

258
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:50,169
Swell...

259
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,988
Spinach monster !

260
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:40,605
Hit it !

261
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:44,155
Plenty of others left to kill...

262
00:58:50,775 --> 00:58:53,896
Another one for the Arena...

263
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,673
Welcome to hell, boy !

264
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:46,521
Tag !
You're it !

265
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:52,681
How do you like hell ?

266
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:56,105
Loser !

267
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:08,389
I hate kids !

268
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:11,791
I really hate kids.

269
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:15,972
<i>Put 'em up !</i>

270
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,197
Loser !

271
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:40,334
Who do you think
you are, a windmill ?

272
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,096
Just clock the creep.

273
01:00:44,193 --> 01:00:45,190
Get up !

274
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:51,356
Hit me !
I dare you to hit me !

275
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:53,806
Come on !

276
01:01:05,518 --> 01:01:06,293
Child!

277
01:01:07,452 --> 01:01:09,774
You are the victor!

278
01:01:10,474 --> 01:01:14,539
You have been chosen
by the windmill god !

279
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,291
And now you will
be sacrificed to him !

280
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:44,242
If I were you, I'd run...

281
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:48,195
If you were me,
you'd be good looking.

282
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:51,608
That's not nice... Get him !

283
01:02:18,353 --> 01:02:20,473
Oh goody, another sacrifice!

284
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:23,409
Bow down before the
great and powerful windmill god.

285
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:25,454
What, you're expecting
someone bigger ?

286
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:26,818
Hurry it up, I'm hungry.

287
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:29,639
Yes oh mighty windmill god!

288
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,259
<i>Bring in the other one,
I'm still hungry!</i>

289
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,288
Swell...

290
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:39,481
Well I'll be...

291
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,427
Looks like I'm gonna
make my gig in Vegas after all !

292
01:04:16,255 --> 01:04:19,169
<i>Caller 22, you're on the air
with the Werewolf.</i>

293
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:22,565
<i>Hey, Wolfie ! I can't
believe I got through !</i>

294
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,251
<i>I never call these shows.</i>

295
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:26,774
<i>Well you only have to get
picked by the Wolf once, baby,</i>

296
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:28,106
<i>then you're hooked for life !</i>

297
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:29,905
<i>Yesterday, I was out cruising,</i>

298
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:33,269
<i>these ruskie cats stopped
my ride, and asked to see my papers,</i>

299
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:35,557
<i>and made me sing
the ruskie national anthem !</i>

300
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,125
<i>By the way,
I think the King should--</i>

301
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:46,056
<i>Yah baby, this one's going
out to all you freedom fighters</i>

302
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:49,982
<i>holding back the red plague on the
rock'n'roller's frontline to Vegas !</i>

303
01:04:50,384 --> 01:04:52,980
<i>Keep the faith, baby,
we're waiting for The King.</i>

304
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:55,895
<i>Don't let us down, you King !</i>

305
01:05:10,195 --> 01:05:11,733
Here we go again !

306
01:05:22,103 --> 01:05:23,657
I'll handle this.

307
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,144
How much further to Vegas, comrade ?

308
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:31,981
No one goes to
Lost Vegas without papers.

309
01:05:31,983 --> 01:05:34,454
No one, four eyes !

310
01:05:35,554 --> 01:05:36,291
Okay...

311
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:38,644
Comrads !

312
01:05:57,943 --> 01:06:00,784
So this isn't going to be
as easy as I thought.

313
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:05,945
We'd skin you alive
for a six-pack, Americanski.

314
01:06:10,657 --> 01:06:14,329
This is my road,
you are in Soviet territory

315
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:16,735
No one goes through. No one !

316
01:06:17,336 --> 01:06:21,257
You're screwed, Buddy ol'pal.

317
01:06:21,259 --> 01:06:24,673
The war is over, baby.
It's been over for years.

318
01:06:25,173 --> 01:06:27,648
I'm the new
rock'n'roll king of Vegas.

319
01:06:30,347 --> 01:06:33,248
So all you commies, step aside.

320
01:06:34,518 --> 01:06:38,652
I do not like rock'n'roll music !
It is too loud.

321
01:06:38,853 --> 01:06:43,215
I like folk music.
Soft, nice music, uh ?

322
01:06:43,215 --> 01:06:46,304
Polka ?
What ? Anything !

323
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:49,611
I don't do polka, baby.

324
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:53,057
No one rock'n'roll in Lost Vegas !

325
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,898
Papers, no papers.
Understand ? No one !

326
01:07:03,923 --> 01:07:05,375
Come on!

327
01:07:13,315 --> 01:07:17,592
Float away, little butterfly,
just flutter away...

328
01:07:20,552 --> 01:07:21,735
Don't go...

329
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:24,500
If you scratch my guitar,
I'll kill you !

330
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,394
Don't go !

331
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,528
This isn't going to
be as easy as I thought.

332
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:44,378
Why don't he just shoot him ?

333
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:48,435
We haven't had bullets since '57 !

334
01:08:49,235 --> 01:08:52,211
Tiger claw !
Tiger claw ! Go, go !

335
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:48,782
Kid ?

336
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:07,919
Kid ?

337
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,422
Kid ?

338
01:12:12,423 --> 01:12:14,474
Buddy !

339
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,832
Buddy ?

340
01:14:42,953 --> 01:14:45,851
- It was him...
- It was him !

341
01:14:45,853 --> 01:14:47,653
He was here...

342
01:14:47,752 --> 01:14:52,722
Only one man could kill
this many Russians...

343
01:14:52,724 --> 01:14:55,840
Bring his guitar to me...

344
01:14:55,841 --> 01:15:00,514
This time, no mistakes,
or it'll be your heads !

345
01:15:01,484 --> 01:15:02,567
Hit it !

346
01:15:04,823 --> 01:15:07,784
He's really pissed off !

347
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:10,436
Pissed off...

348
01:15:10,537 --> 01:15:14,759
Don't let the four eyes
reach Vegas alive !

349
01:15:17,628 --> 01:15:20,426
Vegas...

350
01:15:32,306 --> 01:15:36,175
Congratulations, kid...
We made it !

351
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:43,141
Vegas !

352
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,987
Freeze, sucker !

353
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:19,948
Surrender the sword,

354
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:22,782
and hand over the guitar

355
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:26,021
or the kid gets it !

356
01:16:26,023 --> 01:16:29,518
- Get him...
- Yeah, get it !

357
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:34,020
You have an appointment with Death !

358
01:16:34,365 --> 01:16:36,972
Four eyes...

359
01:16:42,827 --> 01:16:45,679
Keep going, kid !

360
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:20,326
Congratulations,
you've been the only one

361
01:17:20,627 --> 01:17:23,335
to escape my grasp...

362
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:26,679
Swell...

363
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:30,045
I heard you were
an excellent player,

364
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:32,780
but you are much too naive...

365
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,671
You surrender too easily...

366
01:17:35,872 --> 01:17:39,043
Relinquish what is mine.

367
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,840
Looking for this ?

368
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,233
Take it ! It's yours...

369
01:17:46,434 --> 01:17:48,507
You disappoint me...

370
01:17:48,507 --> 01:17:52,711
I only take what's valuable to you.

371
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:54,688
You can't have him !

372
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:56,284
Oh, really ?

373
01:17:56,484 --> 01:18:00,311
Then perhaps if you
won't play for yourself,

374
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:03,980
you will play for the boy's soul !

375
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,003
Enough !

376
01:18:55,005 --> 01:18:56,960
Stick him, boys...

377
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:57,438
It stopped...

378
01:20:03,551 --> 01:20:05,366
Buddy...

379
01:20:13,284 --> 01:20:16,192
They're coming !

380
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:12,130
I've got an appointment with Death !

381
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:12,592
Admit it !

382
01:22:13,193 --> 01:22:17,252
You are weak
and you've been defeated.

383
01:22:17,453 --> 01:22:18,454
Now...

384
01:22:18,654 --> 01:22:23,201
Bend before the ways
of Heavy Metal !

385
01:23:41,192 --> 01:23:43,980
You were the last...

386
01:23:44,381 --> 01:23:49,324
Soon Vegas will be all mine !

387
01:23:50,372 --> 01:23:51,570
Leave him alone !

388
01:23:58,039 --> 01:24:00,207
Is that blood ?

389
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:12,460
Stupid child !

390
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:15,390
Stay back !

391
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,569
What are you doing ?!

392
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:21,364
He killed Top Hat !

393
01:25:21,365 --> 01:25:25,153
- Top Hat ?
- Nobody kills Top Hat !

394
01:25:26,632 --> 01:25:28,989
You've killed Death !

395
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:32,077
- Killed him...
- Yeah...

396
01:25:35,779 --> 01:25:39,545
If you ever need a band...

397
01:25:39,546 --> 01:25:42,122
Call us...
