00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,558
CITY OF GOD

2
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,358
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,161
Go on, for fuck's sake!

4
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,400
Get that chicken!

5
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,051
If it’s a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

6
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,419
-You think so, Rocket?
-Gotta take the risk.

7
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:33,257
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

8
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:37,165
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

9
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:42,072
Get that chicken, bro!

10
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:47,368
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!

11
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,707
Outta my way!

12
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,917
Get that chicken!

13
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,266
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

14
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,905
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

15
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,480
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

16
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,355
Shit! The cops!

17
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,824
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:38,825
Give me that.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,901
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

20
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,461
A picture could change
my life, but...

21
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:50,937
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...

22
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:55,002
...and if you stay, they get you too.
-They’re coming for us!

23
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:57,876
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...

24
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:04,520
THE SIXTIES

25
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:12,862
You’re useless, man!

26
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:15,897
-Go get the ball!
-Fucking useless!

27
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,198
Hey, kid!

28
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:23,432
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

29
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:28,771
-It’s not yours.
-You wanna mess with me?

30
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,415
Fuck off.

31
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:35,781
-What’s your name?
-Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

32
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,512
-My name’s Rocket.
-Some advice, Rocket...

33
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,288
Don’t let Li’l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

34
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:44,786
-You lose, pal.
-Go, Shaggy!

35
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:47,227
That's Shaggy.

36
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:50,834
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.

37
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:53,060
8, 9, 10, 11...

38
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,742
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

39
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:03,141
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck’s coming.
What are you fucking around for?

40
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,283
You’re not gonna chicken out...

41
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,147
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

42
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:21,288
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.

43
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,057
Shaggy...

44
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,430
Clipper...

45
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,572
and Goose.

46
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:33,238
Tagging along were always
Li’l Dice and Benny...

47
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,379
Shaggy's brother.

48
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,312
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

49
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:50,862
Okay, let’s go.

50
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,656
Come on, Goose.

51
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:55,423
Let’s go!

52
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,379
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

53
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:15,985
Stop or I’ll shoot, motherfucker!

54
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:18,485
Get out!

55
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,954
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

56
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,824
Who wants gas?

57
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:38,933
More! You wanna die for your
boss’ damn money?

58
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:41,134
Shitloads of money here!

59
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,579
You see, asshole?

60
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:47,745
Asshole!

61
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,920
Fuck! The cops!

62
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,352
Let’s get outta here!

63
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:03,129
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

64
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,147
-Shaggy!
-The ball, Goose, it’s yours!

65
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:34,692
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...

66
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,060
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

67
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,704
Here! Buy some new balls.

68
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:45,709
But they were just amateurs.

69
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,572
-Even my brother, Goose.
-Rocket, give this money to dad.

70
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,052
But don’t tell him it’s from me.

71
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:59,485
Okay?

72
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,684
-Hey, Stringy!
-Yeah?

73
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,158
Look how much I’ve got.

74
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:25,379
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.

75
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:30,247
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...

76
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,855
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.

77
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,992
-A light post!
-We’ll have electricity!

78
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,355
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

79
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,498
Homeless? Off to City of God!

80
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,761
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.

81
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:49,168
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

82
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:52,377
We were too far removed...

83
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:55,045
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

84
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:14,494
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

85
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,531
I don’t know.

86
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,601
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

87
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:22,329
I don’t want to sell fish.
It stinks.

88
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,240
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

89
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,947
So what do you want to be?

90
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,974
I don’t know.

91
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,777
-Not a hood or a policeman.
-Why not?

92
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:37,147
I’m scared of getting shot.

93
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,094
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

94
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:47,788
Pointing that gun at me?

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,230
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li’l Dice is with me.

96
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:54,269
Right, I'm a gangster too.

97
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:57,100
-That gas truck didn't bring much.
-So what?

98
00:09:57,308 --> 00:10:00,937
-We rob gas trucks every day.
-One today, another tomorrow.

99
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
No, we need to rob
some rich guy’s house.

100
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,082
That’s the only
way to get outta here.

101
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:09,583
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

102
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,221
That’s it.

103
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:15,519
The little fart’s getting
too big for his britches!

104
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,833
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

105
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:30,201
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

106
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:35,069
What you got in mind, Li’l Dice?

107
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,875
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.

108
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,180
And Li’l Dice had them.

109
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,848
-Is that the motel?
-Yeah.

110
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,993
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

111
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,531
-I need this.
-Don’t touch my gun, kid.

112
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:58,929
Don’t ever do that again.

113
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,728
-Don’t point at me.
-Fuck you.

114
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:04,601
-Don’t point your finger at me!
-Stop acting like a baby!

115
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:06,503
Here’s yours.

116
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:09,111
-Awesome!
-Let’s go!

117
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,838
-Not so fast!
-What?

118
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:14,517
You stay here and keep watch.

119
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:20,087
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

120
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:23,192
-Why me? Let that dork do that.
-Look...

121
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:28,593
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy’s absolutely useless!

122
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,562
-You just had the idea.
-Exactly!

123
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,259
You’re just a kid, remember?

124
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,601
You cover us, okay?

125
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,376
You’ll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

126
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:45,072
You stay there.

127
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:52,014
This is a hold-up, bitch.

128
00:11:55,126 --> 00:12:01,793
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,993
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

130
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:09,070
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

131
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,805
Okay, Clipper?

132
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,244
Shall we go in?

133
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,850
I didn't order anything.

134
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:27,184
It’s on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

135
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,656
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

136
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,452
-Don’t point that...
-Your wallet...

137
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,399
Hey, man...

138
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,806
What kind of whorehouse is this?

139
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,608
-You from the church?
-Yes, brother.

140
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:57,677
Give it to me!

141
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,187
Slut!

142
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,223
You're old, fat and flabby!

143
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,494
Wanna take her place?

144
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,129
What’s going on?

145
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:16,968
-The cops! Let’s beat it!
-Let’s go!

146
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,605
Take that car.
I'll go get Li’l Dice.

147
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,418
Jesus, what a car!

148
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,161
-Something fucked up. Li’l Dice’s gone.
-The cops are shooting, let’s go!

149
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,591
Slow down! Hold on...

150
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:12,627
-You said you knew how to drive.
-I do, so cool it!

151
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,527
Turn! Watch out!

152
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,910
You fucking asshole!

153
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,678
Hey, I didn’t do it on purpose.

154
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:38,514
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

155
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:45,194
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

156
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,729
Goose fucked up his ankle.

157
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:48,922
It fucking hurts.

158
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:53,036
Take him into the woods.
I’ll shoot to distract the cops.

159
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,570
-In God we trust.
-In God we trust.

160
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,743
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

161
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:06,850
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.

162
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,076
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.

163
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:14,982
-It fucking hurts, Goose.
-Shut up.

164
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:20,426
-Wait up...
-You sound like a damn sissy, man.

165
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,766
-Give me your hand! Climb up!
-No one saw anything?

166
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:32,807
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

167
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,002
I suppose you didn’t see
anything either?

168
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:39,945
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

169
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:44,142
So what’s up, Shorty?

170
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:47,586
They’re hiding in the woods.

171
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:50,253
-Hello, Melonhead.
-How are you doing?

172
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:53,898
I have this feeling that
they’re out in the woods.

173
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:57,692
-The motherfuckers.
-They’re out in the woods.

174
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,633
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

175
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:09,308
I can’t see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

176
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,947
Fucking jungle.

177
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:20,282
-They stole a fortune at that motel.
-I know.

178
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:25,288
What if we took the money?

179
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:29,961
Are you crazy?
I’m not getting mixed up in that.

180
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:32,727
I want to exterminate these guys.

181
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:37,236
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

182
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:44,242
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

183
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:15,773
-Did you hear those shots?
-If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

184
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,048
Maracana!

185
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,554
Open the door.

186
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:37,563
-What’s the matter?
-The cops are after me.

187
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:47,342
Shaggy!

188
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:51,413
-Shaggy!
-The cops are on my ass!

189
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,846
-Hide me!
-Quick, come in.

190
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:07,028
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

191
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,267
I had a vision, Goose.

192
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:14,732
You been smoking something?

193
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,906
-You've had a job, right?
-Yeah.

194
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,167
What’s it like?
What do people say?

195
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:22,504
I worked with my father.

196
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:26,274
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

197
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:31,545
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

198
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:37,160
-This gangster’s life isn’t for me.
-Wait! The cops are still down there.

199
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,024
I don’t give a shit.

200
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,862
I'm going back to the church.

201
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,563
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...

202
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:51,138
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...

203
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:55,608
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

204
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:59,044
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

205
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,277
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...

206
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:07,355
-Stop, motherfucker!
-Don’t move!

207
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:11,127
Stop, or I’ll shoot!

208
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:17,791
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

209
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:22,769
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.

210
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:25,807
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

211
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,445
I don’t think this guy
was involved in the heist.

212
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,341
See here?

213
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:36,952
-He’s a worker, not a hoodlum.
-I’ll make him one now.

214
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:44,523
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

215
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:50,228
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

216
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:55,395
And Goose was
in my father's hands.

217
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:59,097
Why do you do these things?
You think I’m a fool?

218
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,005
From now on,
you’ll work with me.

219
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:06,376
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

220
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,575
You listen to me.

221
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:13,154
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

222
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:19,227
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

223
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,198
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.

224
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:29,669
Don’t worry.
Dad’s mad at me...

225
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:34,277
but he’ll get over it.

226
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:41,475
Give me that, Rocket. It’s not
for you. You have to study.

227
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:45,019
-Getting shot doesn’t scare you?
-I’m a hood because I got no brain.

228
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:49,057
But you’re smart.
You should study.

229
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,858
I go to school because
I don’t like physical work.

230
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:57,993
Promise me something... That you’ll
never touch this gun. Promise?

231
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,795
Let’s shake.

232
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,865
We’d better hurry.

233
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:09,671
I’m gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don’t laugh.

234
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:11,644
You grinned when I got slapped.

235
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,749
-Who, me?
-I saw you.

236
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:45,203
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

237
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,009
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

238
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:52,383
-I'm thinking of what to say to you.
-You’re thinking, as well?

239
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,922
Don’t. It’ll be your downfall.

240
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:59,392
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

241
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:02,030
Are you pulling my leg?

242
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:05,395
You never heard of
love at first sight?

243
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:11,030
-Hoods don’t love, they desire.
-You cut down everything I say.

244
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,938
Hoods don’t talk,
they smooth-talk.

245
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:18,479
Well, I’ll stop wasting
my breath on you.

246
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:22,210
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

247
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:25,711
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

248
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,450
It’s not love,
it’s a con game.

249
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:48,176
It’s just that I love you.

250
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:52,807
You just might end up
convincing me...

251
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:19,798
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.

252
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,315
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.

253
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:37,217
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.

254
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:43,998
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.

255
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:48,303
3 MONTHS LATER

256
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,666
Shaggy...

257
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:53,207
Why don’t you change your life?

258
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:57,375
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

259
00:23:57,582 --> 00:24:00,415
-Good-for-nothing!
-What do you mean?

260
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:03,586
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

261
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:08,658
That’s right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

262
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:17,728
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

263
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:22,496
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

264
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:26,575
Sure! For me, that’s
nothing but smooth-talk.

265
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:40,753
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

266
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:41,947
Are you kidding?

267
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,726
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

268
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,066
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

269
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:54,727
Did you see anything?
You don’t know shit, so shut up.

270
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:58,067
You weren’t there.
I didn’t kill anyone.

271
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:01,972
I bet it’s those fucking policemen,
and I’m the one taking the rap.

272
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:05,807
They even nabbed Li’l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

273
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:10,083
-I don't care who did it.
-It wasn’t me.

274
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,554
Let me just say... I don’t want my
kid’s father to be a hoodlum.

275
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,157
You’re all alone, Shaggy.

276
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,259
-All alone?
-That’s right!

277
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:20,259
-Clipper’s gone religious.
-Hallelujah!

278
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:22,158
-Goose is working.
-Ass-kisser!

279
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,492
-And you?
-I haven’t changed. So what?

280
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:29,001
They’ve deserted me,
that’s all.

281
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,366
Then I’m deserting you too.

282
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:34,066
I’m splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

283
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,145
Otherwise, I’ll go alone.

284
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:54,823
Fish for sale!

285
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:58,999
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

286
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:04,663
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.

287
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,173
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

288
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:13,082
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

289
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:16,253
I also have a kisser fish.

290
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,786
Hey, that’s a mullet!

291
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:23,423
Doesn’t your husband...

292
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,753
go down on you?

293
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,454
No.

294
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,996
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

295
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:36,866
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

296
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:42,273
-Good God, no. Doesn’t it hurt?
-The first few times.

297
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,211
Then you’ll see, it’s fantastic.
But you need a banana.

298
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,906
What for?

299
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:51,110
You’re missing the good things
in life, girl!

300
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:54,222
You take a banana, warm it up...

301
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:58,155
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

302
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:02,560
It’s a real rush!
Ask your husband.

303
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:07,534
I couldn’t. You don’t know him.
He’s liable to beat me.

304
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:11,434
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

305
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:21,383
Motherfucking nigger!

306
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,953
Slut!

307
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:29,524
Whoring bitch!

308
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:36,495
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

309
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,966
-Take them off, dammit!
-I'm not going naked in the street.

310
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:45,039
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

311
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:47,072
Give me your shirt.

312
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:52,015
Your shorts! Hurry up!

313
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:58,851
I knew it. It’s always me
who forks up for that bum.

314
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:09,831
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

315
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:12,229
-That brat there?
-I’ll castrate that fucker.

316
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:19,608
Fish! Fish for sale!

317
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:23,273
Hey, kid, come over here.

318
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:27,240
-Where’s your brother?
-He’s not working today.

319
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:30,181
-Oh yeah? Get in.
-I didn’t do anything.

320
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,377
-Get in!
-What about my fish?

321
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:35,717
-Hurry it up, kid!
-I don’t want to lose my fish!

322
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:39,884
-Forget your fish.
-Sit your ass down.

323
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:43,896
-My father will kill me.
-That doesn’t matter.

324
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:57,441
Let’s go.
There’s nothing here.

325
00:28:57,647 --> 00:29:01,583
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.

326
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,412
Let’s go, Felipe.

327
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:09,923
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.

328
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:13,585
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

329
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:20,730
Li’l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

330
00:29:20,938 --> 00:29:27,605
-You’re fucking loaded!
-Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

331
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:32,046
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

332
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:37,076
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

333
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:42,015
-I'm leaving the ghetto.
-But Shorty had his hands full...

334
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,073
Let’s go see, Stringy.

335
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:11,250
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

336
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:14,218
The tabloids went to town:

337
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:17,587
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"

338
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:20,662
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

339
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:24,799
The hoodlums took off.

340
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:29,269
-You wanna die?
-It’s you who’s gonna die...

341
00:30:29,472 --> 00:30:33,603
if you don’t do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

342
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:37,671
Let’s go, dammit!

343
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,611
-There are cops ahead.
-Fuck them, let’s go.

344
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,480
-Where to?
-Anywhere, just go.

345
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,058
-What’s the matter?
-Have mercy!

346
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,193
-This car’s a piece of junk.
-My ass! Start the damn thing!

347
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:54,921
It needs a push.

348
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,131
Push, Shaggy!

349
00:30:58,335 --> 00:30:59,825
Push!

350
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:17,485
You?

351
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:20,988
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

352
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:24,354
Nab that guy over there!

353
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:50,745
Run, Shaggy!

354
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:54,355
Stop the car!

355
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:42,171
-This way! He’s over here.
-We got that sonofabitch!

356
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,112
-The bastard!
-He’s a murderer.

357
00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:04,317
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...

358
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,190
and a camera.

359
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:10,662
I’d always wanted to have one.

360
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:15,303
Let’s go to school.

361
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:26,282
-Well?
-Let’s go to the beach.

362
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:27,813
But we have an exam.

363
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:31,681
So what?

364
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:34,482
Everyone else is at the beach.

365
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:37,682
Come on, let’s go!

366
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:41,296
She’s in a bikini,
but doesn’t want to go.

367
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:46,400
What’s that saying you have?

368
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:49,766
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

369
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:54,640
THE SEVENTIES

370
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,745
-Over here!
-I bought my first camera...

371
00:33:56,946 --> 00:34:01,212
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...

372
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:04,120
with the world's cheapest model.

373
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:08,019
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

374
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:10,284
Any luck getting laid yet?

375
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:12,586
Zilch.

376
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:19,197
-Angelica. I was crazy about her.
-So, Rocket, still clicking away?

377
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,598
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

378
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:25,795
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

379
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:29,568
With her, buddy?
She’s got a guy.

380
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:33,009
-So? I’m not jealous.
-Her father’s a sergeant.

381
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:37,048
No one’s perfect.
Closer together!

382
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,516
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

383
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:46,585
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.

384
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,097
Thiago, move back a little.

385
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,101
-Is this okay?
-Perfect.

386
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:09,081
I need a joint.

387
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:14,050
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It’s far out.

388
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:18,157
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

389
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:23,492
If you like,
I can get it for you.

390
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:28,327
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

391
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:32,302
But the choice stuff is coke.
That’s a real nercotic.

392
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,838
Narcotic!

393
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:41,342
-Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
-Screw you.

394
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:44,144
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

395
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,842
-You’re never in the water.
-My dad’s a lifeguard.

396
00:35:47,054 --> 00:35:50,990
-I’ll bet you a beer I swim better.
-You’re on.

397
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:57,595
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky’s.

398
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:13,704
I’d have done anything
to please her...

399
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:17,409
Buy her pot, coke...

400
00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:26,958
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...

401
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,498
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.

402
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:38,699
-Who is it?
-Rocket.

403
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:45,174
-How are things down there?
-Fine.

404
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,472
-And the kids?
-Fine too.

405
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:49,581
-You want to buy or smoke a joint?
-Buy.

406
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:54,550
Come in, buddy.

407
00:36:56,123 --> 00:37:00,617
Who is it?

408
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,599
This was Blacky's turf.

409
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:11,396
But it hadn't always been his.

410
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,402
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

411
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,876
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

412
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:27,844
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

413
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:32,048
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.

414
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,664
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.

415
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:43,565
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!

416
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:48,835
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.

417
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:54,238
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

418
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:59,152
-What about my pot?
-Stick it up your ass.

419
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:02,117
The best dealer...

420
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:06,590
...was Carrot.

421
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:09,423
-Can I have a sip?
-Sure.

422
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,259
He earned Big Boy's trust...

423
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:15,459
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.

424
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,333
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

425
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,775
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

426
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:29,916
-His name was Aristotle.
-My wife needs an operation.

427
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:36,454
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.

428
00:38:36,657 --> 00:38:39,422
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.

429
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:44,063
Here’s the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

430
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:47,097
-You’ve bailed me out, brother.
-Friday.

431
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:51,536
He’s my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

432
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:55,731
Give him another week.

433
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:02,473
-Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
-Carrot had no choice.

434
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:08,679
-I said Friday.
-Don’t do it, man.

435
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:12,484
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.

436
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:16,920
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.

437
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:23,695
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...

438
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,534
but didn’t want the apartment...

439
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:31,610
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...

440
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:34,543
-Here. 150 bags.
-Blacky.

441
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,875
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

442
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,349
That's how he took over
the local trade.

443
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:42,818
But not for long...

444
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:46,289
Who is it?

445
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:48,358
Go see.

446
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:01,297
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

447
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:05,376
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

448
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,447
Yeah, who?

449
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:15,555
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

450
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:18,021
My name is Li’l Z’ now.

451
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:20,626
THE STORY OF LI’L Z’

452
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:23,853
Li’l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...

453
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:28,398
ever since he was little
and was called "Li’l Dice".

454
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:35,471
They’re having fun,
and not me?

455
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,550
I want to get out of here.

456
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:52,383
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

457
00:40:58,565 --> 00:41:01,830
That night, Li'l Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...

458
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,561
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.

459
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,246
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

460
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:20,182
He had to work hard for peanuts.

461
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:28,456
-Yeah, Benny!
-Li’l Dice and Benny managed well.

462
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,260
They had the gift of crime.

463
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,231
-You have more money than me.
-It was my idea.

464
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:38,599
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...

465
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:42,037
...like my brother, Goose.
-Li’l Dice?

466
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:45,576
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

467
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,476
You’re fucking loaded!

468
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:52,346
Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

469
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:57,256
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

470
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:01,985
that Shorty is squealing.
I’m leaving the ghetto.

471
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,032
Goose!

472
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:11,872
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

473
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,554
From one hit to the next,
Li’l Dice grew up.

474
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:39,164
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.

475
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,426
You’re of age now, watch out!

476
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:44,934
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

477
00:42:58,219 --> 00:42:59,880
Li’l Dice, how’s it going?

478
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:03,717
Happy birthday.
I’m so glad you’ve turned 18...

479
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:07,156
-Get lost, Tuba!
-Excuse me, amigo...

480
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,854
Give me a beer!

481
00:43:10,063 --> 00:43:13,692
Didn’t you see me, prick?

482
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,765
-Sorry, man.
-Up yours!

483
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,336
The next time,
I’ll waste you, asshole!

484
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:22,767
Fag!

485
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,045
Li'l Dice was ready for anything.

486
00:43:26,246 --> 00:43:28,181
I wanna talk.

487
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:31,374
-And he was itching to start.
-Who are the fattest cats here?

488
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:36,050
-There are tons of them.
-Look at Jerry Adriani...

489
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:40,353
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

490
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:42,756
Look at Pereira
and the chick he’s with...

491
00:43:42,963 --> 00:43:46,831
-Bernice. She was my brother’s girl.
-Check out his car.

492
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:51,565
Then there’s Blacky.
Covered in gold.

493
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:54,434
Gold chain, gold watch...

494
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:57,804
Look at Carrot, and his car.

495
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:01,743
-They’re all dealers.
-They’re all fucking loaded.

496
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,974
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

497
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,982
-The big bucks are in drugs.
-I see.

498
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:09,179
Especially in selling coke.

499
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:11,653
-But you need money.
-Not really...

500
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,556
We’ll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

501
00:44:15,762 --> 00:44:18,527
-When do we start?
-Now.

502
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:32,999
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

503
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,807
He brought you here.

504
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:40,215
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

505
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:45,490
I know what you want.
You want power.

506
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:49,823
I have something which will
give it to you.

507
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:55,858
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

508
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,664
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

509
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:02,341
otherwise...

510
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,811
you’ll die.

511
00:45:06,313 --> 00:45:08,713
The boy is no longer called
Li’l Dice...

512
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,907
but Li’l Z’.

513
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:14,679
Li’l Z’ will grow up.

514
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:18,789
You stick with me,
I’ll stick with you.

515
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,528
Li’l Dice became Li'l Z'
and he began to kill.

516
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:41,241
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

517
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:46,818
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

518
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:50,422
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...

519
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:54,583
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...

520
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:55,853
But that would be easy.

521
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,695
Who is it?

522
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:12,308
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

523
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:18,644
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

524
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:20,480
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

525
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:24,146
-My name is Li’l Z’ now.
-His name’s Li’l Z’, see?

526
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:27,486
-You’re a goner, bastard.
-Don’t kill him. He understands.

527
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:29,822
Right, Blacky?

528
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,558
It’s all yours, I don’t want anything.
I don’t want no trouble, okay?

529
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:37,896
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

530
00:46:39,773 --> 00:46:44,472
You’ll live, but you’ll
work for us. Understand?

531
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,771
That's easy to say...

532
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:51,311
-Where are you going?
-He’s clean, Li’l Z’.

533
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:53,318
What’s your name, kid?

534
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:57,321
-Rocket.
-He’s Goose’s brother.

535
00:46:57,525 --> 00:47:00,119
-Goose?
-The late Goose.

536
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,593
Quick, kid. Run along.

537
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:08,257
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li’l Z’.

538
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:12,371
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

539
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:14,468
Cocaine.

540
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:20,413
-Where’s the turf?
-Over there, on the left.

541
00:47:20,614 --> 00:47:23,639
Selling drugs is like any
other business.

542
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,885
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...

543
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,817
which is then
packaged on the premises.

544
00:47:29,155 --> 00:47:32,956
It's done in an assembly line.

545
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:35,219
Boring as hell...

546
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:39,722
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

547
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:42,697
Cocaine is put into packets...

548
00:47:43,436 --> 00:47:47,668
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

549
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:50,909
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

550
00:47:51,112 --> 00:47:54,945
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

551
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:59,208
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.

552
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:02,946
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...

553
00:48:03,157 --> 00:48:05,990
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

554
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,855
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".

555
00:48:11,065 --> 00:48:14,159
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.

556
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:18,498
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".

557
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:22,333
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...

558
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:26,001
the boss' right-hand man.

559
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:31,384
The police receive their part
and don’t make trouble.

560
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:36,181
Since Li’l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...

561
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:41,349
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...

562
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:45,255
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

563
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:51,364
The City teemed with addicts
and Li’l Z' grew rich.

564
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:54,603
-Is it okay?
-It’s a deal.

565
00:48:58,278 --> 00:49:02,306
-I can’t decide which to wear.
-This one’s cool.

566
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,519
If dealing were legal, Li’l Z'
would have been man of the year.

567
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,726
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

568
00:49:13,927 --> 00:49:18,125
-And he was everywhere.
-What a drag this guy is.

569
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:23,462
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.

570
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:30,975
Half a lid. Thanks.

571
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:36,277
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

572
00:49:37,952 --> 00:49:40,819
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.

573
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:46,823
-I was about to win her over...
-These pictures are really great.

574
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:50,621
-You think so?
-I look good here.

575
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,595
-You look beautiful everywhere.
-I’m serious.

576
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,789
Me too.

577
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:02,938
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...

578
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:05,976
I was sure this was it...

579
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,170
But the Runts arrived.

580
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,014
Can I have a toke?

581
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:19,786
Here.

582
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:24,192
I’m going. See you later.

583
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,364
Hold on, Angelica.

584
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,061
-Your joint, man.
-Keep it.

585
00:50:32,273 --> 00:50:34,605
What a cool guy.

586
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:41,947
That was my first run
in with the Runts.

587
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,880
-Steak and fries, Benny.
-Great! Here...

588
00:50:54,393 --> 00:51:00,332
-A tip for you.
-Really? Thanks.

589
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:02,830
-Wanna eat something?
-No.

590
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:10,237
-Wanna trade this watch?
-After Angelica left him...

591
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,343
Thiago began snorting
more and more.

592
00:51:12,545 --> 00:51:15,639
-Is it your grandfather’s?
-No, my dad’s.

593
00:51:15,847 --> 00:51:20,148
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

594
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:22,480
-Two bags of ten.
-One of ten.

595
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:26,784
-Okay, one bag.
-For Thiago, it was different.

596
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:30,485
-Watch out!
-Sorry, godfather.

597
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:33,660
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

598
00:51:33,865 --> 00:51:36,891
-I’m sorry.
-Now beat it.

599
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:43,498
Blacky, lend me your bike.

600
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:09,230
Hey, wanna race?

601
00:52:09,434 --> 00:52:12,893
-Where to?
-Up to the highway.

602
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,440
-Okay.
-Ready? Go!

603
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:42,664
-Pretty tough, wasn’t it?
-Yeah, you’re good.

604
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:45,201
Where’d you buy those sneakers?

605
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:47,998
-Not far from here.
-The shirt, as well?

606
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,538
-No, uptown.
-Cool.

607
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:52,972
It’s a designer shirt.

608
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:55,510
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

609
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,376
Shorts and a shirt?

610
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:02,917
Buy whatever you can.

611
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,650
-What size are you?
-Measure me.

612
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,795
-With what, man?
-Shit, with your hand.

613
00:53:12,297 --> 00:53:15,027
Shoe size? Turn around.

614
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:28,769
-Hey, Benny!
-You got the digs?

615
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:35,048
-Just one pair of pants?
-No, there’s more.

616
00:53:40,193 --> 00:53:41,455
-You like it?
-Yeah.

617
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:45,059
There’s some change.

618
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,565
-Keep it.
-Cool.

619
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:59,670
This is Benny.

620
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,375
-This is Rocket.
-Hi. I know him.

621
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,502
I’ve become a playboy.

622
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:37,576
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

623
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:39,614
Watch out...

624
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,481
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

625
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,687
Oh, yeah?

626
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,257
Fuck off, you bastards!

627
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:58,400
Making fun of me?

628
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,867
Asshole!

629
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:20,987
Benny, didn’t I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He’s endangering the ghetto.

630
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,720
-Cool it. Go talk to him.
-I’m gonna kill that fucker.

631
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:27,798
-Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
-I’m gonna kill him.

632
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:33,128
Don’t worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

633
00:55:33,338 --> 00:55:35,932
Sure, I’m not worried.

634
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:40,242
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

635
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:44,507
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

636
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:48,278
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

637
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:51,650
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

638
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:55,251
Li’l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

639
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,428
to be the boss of the ghetto.

640
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,894
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.

641
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:02,726
-Hey, Carrot.
-What’s up?

642
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:07,235
You shouldn’t let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

643
00:56:07,806 --> 00:56:10,604
You look after your section,
I’ll look after mine.

644
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:14,677
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

645
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:27,457
-Hey, Rocket! How’s it going?
-Great.

646
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:30,719
-Hey, Benny!
-How’s it going?

647
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:34,465
-Hey, Thiago. How are you?
-Good.

648
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:37,001
-May I?
-Sure...

649
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:39,500
Wanna dance?

650
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:46,467
-Is it okay at your place?
-No problem.

651
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:50,342
My parents are out.
You’ll be all alone with her.

652
00:56:50,548 --> 00:56:54,951
-You can lose your virginity tonight.
-Not so loud, man!

653
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:56,882
Everyone will hear.

654
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,523
-You’re beautiful.
-Thank you.

655
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:05,186
-Shit!
-Nothing’s happening.

656
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:16,705
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

657
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:20,572
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

658
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,978
I want to talk to you
because you’re fucking useless.

659
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:26,173
Get your hand away!

660
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:29,411
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

661
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:30,952
Give the baby his bottle.

662
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,557
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

663
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:37,159
Carrot’s useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

664
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:40,297
The police come around and
that’s bad for business.

665
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:44,160
I’ll do it only because
I like you.

666
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,164
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

667
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:50,205
I’ll show you who’s the baby...

668
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:55,903
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

669
00:57:56,114 --> 00:57:57,581
No wonder you’re "Little" Z’!

670
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:05,690
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.

671
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,349
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...

672
00:58:09,561 --> 00:58:11,757
especially in Carrot's section.

673
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:18,260
What are you doing?

674
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,533
-You rob me all the time!
-But they didn't know...

675
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:27,074
that the City had a boss now.

676
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:30,972
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

677
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:35,016
The City had become
much safer for residents.

678
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:39,222
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

679
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,755
You just had to go see Li’l Z'.

680
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,088
-Let’s go.
-Don’t hurt the Runts.

681
00:58:44,295 --> 00:58:47,196
I won’t touch them.

682
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,837
-Hi, Steak.
-How’s it going, Li’l Z’?

683
00:58:53,038 --> 00:58:55,733
-Wanna take a walk, Steak?
-With you? Hold on...

684
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:01,169
Mom, I’m going out with
my friends.

685
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:16,288
That’s the best chicken
I ever ate.

686
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:20,823
-The old guy was scared shitless.
-Feeling sorry for him?

687
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:24,058
You’re crazy, man!

688
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:35,345
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

689
00:59:35,547 --> 00:59:39,984
-Peanuts. Drugs are where it’s at.
-Yeah, selling drugs.

690
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:46,489
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

691
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:51,925
It’s a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

692
00:59:52,231 --> 00:59:56,565
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

693
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,965
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li’l Z' did.

694
01:00:00,172 --> 01:00:02,867
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

695
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:05,907
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

696
01:00:10,014 --> 01:00:11,572
Come back, you brat!

697
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:22,621
-They’re quick, those kids.
-They run fast.

698
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:26,762
They’re all gone except you.
Any others?

699
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,001
You’re gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

700
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:41,373
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

701
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:43,881
Come on, choose!

702
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,847
Hand or foot?

703
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:52,117
Choose, for fuck's sake!

704
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,992
-Hand.
-The little hand, eh?

705
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,969
Cool.

706
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:19,649
Hey, Steak’n’fries,
let’s see what you’re made of.

707
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:23,184
Choose and then kill
one of them.

708
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:27,189
-Leave it. I’ll do it.
-Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

709
01:01:30,028 --> 01:01:31,860
Go on, Steak.

710
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,500
Go on, choose one and shoot.

711
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:38,726
Come on, I haven’t got all day.

712
01:01:38,936 --> 01:01:41,769
Kill one of them.

713
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,104
Let’s go, Steak.
I’m in a hurry.

714
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:51,681
I wanna see what you’re made of.

715
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,691
Well done!

716
01:02:02,894 --> 01:02:04,123
You did it.

717
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:10,129
-You’re one of us. Give me five.
-Very good, Steak.

718
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:19,471
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

719
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:24,612
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li’l Z”s ghetto.

720
01:02:24,817 --> 01:02:27,581
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

721
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,117
Cool, Li’l Z'.

722
01:02:44,702 --> 01:02:48,365
While Li’l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...

723
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,809
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

724
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:56,974
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

725
01:02:57,181 --> 01:02:59,445
I had no choice.

726
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:03,487
SUCKER’S LIFE

727
01:03:03,688 --> 01:03:07,420
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.

728
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:12,153
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...

729
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:16,391
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

730
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:20,731
But things didn't
work out that way.

731
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:26,471
-It’s the guy on the beach.
-Hey, bro!

732
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,373
-Still smoking good stuff?
-Yeah.

733
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:31,242
That guy’s too cool.

734
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:34,009
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

735
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:42,391
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

736
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:46,086
-What about my severance pay?
-What severance pay?

737
01:03:46,297 --> 01:03:50,256
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

738
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:55,634
You’re fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

739
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,298
I didn’t get a single cent.

740
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,251
It was like a message from God:

741
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:21,396
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker’."

742
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,864
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

743
01:04:34,045 --> 01:04:37,777
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

744
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,984
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

745
01:04:42,186 --> 01:04:43,847
It was Goose’s.
It’s broken anyway.

746
01:04:44,056 --> 01:04:47,115
It’s not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

747
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:51,954
It’s never anyone’s fault.
It’s always someone else’s.

748
01:04:52,164 --> 01:04:56,123
But it’s the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

749
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:58,461
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

750
01:05:00,972 --> 01:05:03,338
I know that guy.

751
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,634
He lives in the City.
He’ll recognize us.

752
01:05:05,844 --> 01:05:08,438
So? He couldn’t care less
if we take his boss’ money.

753
01:05:08,646 --> 01:05:10,911
Okay. Let’s go.

754
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:17,277
Well, boys? Aren’t you from
the City of God?

755
01:05:17,722 --> 01:05:19,019
Yeah.

756
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:22,387
I’ll let one of you through
without paying.

757
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:30,795
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

758
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:33,870
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.

759
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:37,940
-Did you study?
-I was in school and in the army.

760
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:41,306
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

761
01:05:41,512 --> 01:05:44,038
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

762
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:48,446
But I do karate.
If I’m hired somewhere...

763
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,746
I’ll leave the ghetto.

764
01:05:51,255 --> 01:05:55,715
-Do you fight, then?
-I’m for peace and love.

765
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:57,561
But if I have to...

766
01:05:57,762 --> 01:06:00,560
He didn't know he would have to.

767
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:04,327
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

768
01:06:04,902 --> 01:06:07,063
-We should be going.
-Let’s go.

769
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,260
-Good bye.
-Thanks.

770
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,971
See you.

771
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:17,976
I couldn’t do it.
He was such a cool guy.

772
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:21,346
Yeah, totally.
That’s Gerson’s brother.

773
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:24,551
Let’s go home.

774
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:30,753
There’s nothing here
except that bakery over there.

775
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:35,832
-What will you say?
-I don’t know. "This is a hold-up."

776
01:06:37,936 --> 01:06:39,528
Here’s my number.

777
01:06:39,737 --> 01:06:41,932
-You like soul or groovy parties?
-Soul.

778
01:06:42,306 --> 01:06:44,069
That one didn't work either.

779
01:06:44,275 --> 01:06:47,608
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.

780
01:06:47,813 --> 01:06:48,972
Will you call me?

781
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,776
I couldn’t pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

782
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:55,782
Yeah, I agree.

783
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:05,762
Excuse me. I’m lost.
How do I get to Barra?

784
01:07:05,963 --> 01:07:06,952
-To Barra?
-Yes.

785
01:07:07,164 --> 01:07:09,962
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."

786
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:13,193
-In fact, we were going there.
-You’re kidding.

787
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,775
-You’re a lifesaver.
-That’s right.

788
01:07:18,543 --> 01:07:21,943
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

789
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,652
-The body’s over here.
-We found it, Chief.

790
01:07:32,858 --> 01:07:35,349
The forensic expert!

791
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:52,934
-Not a pretty sight, eh?
-You said it.

792
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:55,442
-What a great singer.
-You like him?

793
01:07:55,646 --> 01:08:00,982
-I love music. What about you?
-Tell me, do you also like pot?

794
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,780
I can’t say I’ve never tried it.

795
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:10,120
The devil recognizes his own.

796
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:14,791
-Do you have papers?
-I think so.

797
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,434
I have some.

798
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:22,801
I’d always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

799
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:25,407
If I’d had the same skill
with girls...

800
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:30,375
I’d never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.

801
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:37,251
-For a Sao Paulo guy you’re very cool.
-Thanks, bro.

802
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:40,356
What did they use?

803
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:44,752
A club or a rock.
And the child?

804
01:08:44,962 --> 01:08:47,898
-Untouched.
-Thank goodness.

805
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:52,859
-How long ago?
-About four hours.

806
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:56,067
-Can we take it away?
-Go ahead.

807
01:08:57,442 --> 01:09:01,377
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

808
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:24,693
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

809
01:09:25,403 --> 01:09:28,338
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

810
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,532
-The place is crawling with cops now!
-Come on, Li’l Z'.

811
01:09:31,743 --> 01:09:36,203
-Come on? Fuck you!
-I had to avenge my honor.

812
01:09:36,413 --> 01:09:39,905
Her family’s turned me in.
You won’t have any problems.

813
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:43,610
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You’re dead meat, asshole.

814
01:09:43,822 --> 01:09:46,689
Let up, Li’l Z’.
You’ve punished him enough.

815
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,019
You know the law.

816
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,889
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

817
01:09:52,096 --> 01:09:54,690
That was his business, Li’l Z’.

818
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,493
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.

819
01:09:57,702 --> 01:09:59,795
You showed no respect, understand?

820
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:04,637
You know what, Benny?

821
01:10:04,842 --> 01:10:08,403
You’re too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

822
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:11,480
He wasn’t worth shit.

823
01:10:11,882 --> 01:10:14,680
-A dirty traitor.
-Shut up, Tuba.

824
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:17,252
I’m going for a walk
with my girl.

825
01:10:17,454 --> 01:10:22,619
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...

826
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:25,854
we’ll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

827
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:33,862
You need a girlfriend, Li’l Z’.

828
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:56,420
Know what I’m thinking, Benny?

829
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,551
That I’m so sexy?

830
01:10:59,764 --> 01:11:03,324
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

831
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:07,025
-Make love again.
-I’m serious.

832
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:12,335
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

833
01:11:13,577 --> 01:11:14,942
Go where?

834
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,679
To a farm.

835
01:11:19,382 --> 01:11:23,251
We’re really hippies at heart,
aren’t we?

836
01:11:24,654 --> 01:11:26,782
A farm?

837
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,721
Peace and love?

838
01:11:52,582 --> 01:11:57,315
BENNY’S FAREWELL

839
01:12:05,996 --> 01:12:09,295
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

840
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:13,128
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.

841
01:12:13,337 --> 01:12:14,634
The gangs...

842
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,298
The soul crowd...

843
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:28,246
-The religious crowd...
-One day, I’ll go to church.

844
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:30,386
The samba crowd...

845
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:36,252
The groovy crowd...

846
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:43,056
And Li’l Z', who had never
danced in his life.

847
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,947
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

848
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:09,556
-I didn’t hear...
-Want to dance?

849
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,854
No, thank you, I’m with someone.

850
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:29,105
Hey, Rocket!

851
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:46,462
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

852
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,490
-You can’t just split with that chick.
-Why not?

853
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:54,899
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

854
01:13:55,104 --> 01:13:58,904
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?

855
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:02,603
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

856
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:05,407
We’ll take over Carrot’s business,
it’ll be yours.

857
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:08,948
-Leave Carrot alone, he’s a good guy.
-He’s a motherfucker!

858
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,452
See? Everyone’s a motherfucker
to you. That’s why I’m leaving.

859
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:16,353
I’m your friend,
but I’m getting out.

860
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,789
You got to understand,
I have to go.

861
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:24,367
I love you, man,
but I’ve had enough.

862
01:15:23,594 --> 01:15:25,960
Motherfucker, let’s see
if you have any balls.

863
01:15:26,162 --> 01:15:29,757
-What is this?
-You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

864
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,496
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

865
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:38,072
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

866
01:15:38,809 --> 01:15:41,835
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!

867
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,840
Let’s go, nigger!

868
01:15:54,824 --> 01:15:57,793
Show your ass to everyone!

869
01:15:58,395 --> 01:16:00,022
Please...

870
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:07,629
-Strip, dammit!
-Hurry it up!

871
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:22,783
What’s up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

872
01:16:22,985 --> 01:16:27,615
-I don’t deal anymore.
-C’mon, do it for me. You’re my friend.

873
01:16:27,824 --> 01:16:30,487
-Is it stolen?
-It’s okay, it’s my dad’s.

874
01:16:31,228 --> 01:16:33,219
Your dad’s?

875
01:16:34,297 --> 01:16:39,530
-Give it to Li’l Z’.
-Rocket would love this camera.

876
01:16:43,673 --> 01:16:45,403
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

877
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:12,265
Here I am!

878
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:14,596
-You wanna be a photographer?
-Yeah.

879
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:19,806
-Here’s a present.
-Shit, dude! This is great!

880
01:17:20,577 --> 01:17:24,775
Now move your ass.
Shake it!

881
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,826
You’ll take some great pictures.

882
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:50,672
Give me that.

883
01:17:55,912 --> 01:18:02,147
-Give me back the camera!
-No!

884
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:11,755
What’s your problem?
Are you crazy?

885
01:18:38,956 --> 01:18:42,516
They’ve killed Benny!

886
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:49,064
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where’s the motherfucker who did it?

887
01:18:49,865 --> 01:18:54,894
-Z’, Benny is dead.
-No! Call a doctor!

888
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:05,039
Get out of here, bitch!
It’s your fault!

889
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:09,444
Motherfucker!

890
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,944
Where's Carrot?

891
01:19:36,145 --> 01:19:37,806
Blacky's here.

892
01:19:40,216 --> 01:19:42,777
He's in trouble.

893
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:46,583
I’m fucked.

894
01:19:47,056 --> 01:19:49,047
-Why?
-I’m fucked.

895
01:19:49,259 --> 01:19:52,126
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

896
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:54,456
Li’l Z’ is coming
to take your place.

897
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:56,929
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

898
01:19:57,134 --> 01:19:58,761
You killed Benny?

899
01:19:58,969 --> 01:20:02,496
I didn’t mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li’l Z’.

900
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:04,867
Come on, let’s go.

901
01:20:05,074 --> 01:20:07,565
Blacky...

902
01:20:07,778 --> 01:20:10,405
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

903
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:12,877
Let’s go get Li’l Z’.

904
01:20:20,856 --> 01:20:25,520
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.

905
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:28,823
We’re fucked, man.

906
01:20:38,408 --> 01:20:43,710
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?

907
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:49,250
Look who’s here.
My sugar babe.

908
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:51,114
-Let me by.
-Gimme a kiss, girl.

909
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:55,279
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

910
01:20:57,327 --> 01:21:00,387
Come on, Li’l Z’.

911
01:21:08,872 --> 01:21:11,363
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

912
01:21:19,015 --> 01:21:25,682
The problem was simple. Li’l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.

913
01:21:25,889 --> 01:21:31,953
Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li’l Z' had to pay or use force.

914
01:21:32,628 --> 01:21:36,224
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...

915
01:21:36,733 --> 01:21:38,597
and the ugly bad guy.

916
01:21:38,801 --> 01:21:41,362
-Let me go!
-Just enjoy it.

917
01:21:48,677 --> 01:21:54,139
There’s no use fighting.
You’re mine now.

918
01:21:58,387 --> 01:22:01,585
Hey, faggot, your broad’s
really hot!

919
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,188
I can’t even look her in
the face now.

920
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:49,671
Why didn’t that fucker kill me?

921
01:22:53,777 --> 01:22:57,872
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

922
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:00,246
Let’s go back.

923
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:03,247
-What about Carrot?
-We’ll get back to him.

924
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:04,681
You gonna kill him?

925
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:12,451
Knockout Ned, your chick’s a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

926
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:18,100
-Come out, you loser!
-Take it easy...

927
01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:22,431
I’m going out. Let me go.

928
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,911
Gerson! Come back, son!

929
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:52,333
This doesn’t concern you, kid.
We’re here for your brother.

930
01:23:52,536 --> 01:23:55,903
Let’s talk, we can work it out.
My brother’s a peaceful guy.

931
01:23:56,105 --> 01:23:59,302
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

932
01:23:59,509 --> 01:24:00,770
He hasn't done anything.

933
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:04,643
You know who I am?

934
01:24:04,847 --> 01:24:07,908
-Li’l Z’, man.
-He’s Li’l Z’.

935
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:11,385
Call that motherfucker!

936
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:18,926
Go on, man.

937
01:24:19,462 --> 01:24:21,726
Calm down, I’ll call him.

938
01:24:55,332 --> 01:24:58,733
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

939
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:01,267
That loser got what he deserved.

940
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:03,461
Let’s go!

941
01:25:27,197 --> 01:25:31,132
Gerson...

942
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:34,929
That bastard killed my brother.

943
01:25:42,878 --> 01:25:45,643
I can’t let that go.

944
01:26:00,863 --> 01:26:02,990
-Want a gun?
-My son...

945
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,599
Calm down, mom.

946
01:26:07,436 --> 01:26:10,304
Please, mom...

947
01:26:19,114 --> 01:26:22,777
Do it right, asshole.

948
01:26:22,985 --> 01:26:26,716
-There’s no other way.
-How’d I let that loser hit me?

949
01:26:26,922 --> 01:26:29,390
Shit, that’s some hole.

950
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:02,114
-It’s as if we were brothers.
-Shut up.

951
01:27:02,324 --> 01:27:06,853
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

952
01:27:07,063 --> 01:27:10,863
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

953
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:17,164
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

954
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,569
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

955
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:33,282
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

956
01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:35,650
God bless you, son.

957
01:27:35,859 --> 01:27:39,124
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

958
01:27:39,328 --> 01:27:42,024
Well done.

959
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:45,462
You did a good job.

960
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:49,296
You’d better go hide.

961
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:55,173
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

962
01:27:55,377 --> 01:27:58,141
But God had other plans.

963
01:27:58,448 --> 01:28:02,043
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

964
01:28:02,252 --> 01:28:05,517
They’re hiding.
Li’l Z’ is in a bad mood.

965
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:09,452
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

966
01:28:09,658 --> 01:28:12,889
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.

967
01:28:13,095 --> 01:28:14,494
I’ll try.

968
01:28:14,697 --> 01:28:18,154
Tell them it’s for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

969
01:28:38,753 --> 01:28:44,123
Steak’n’fries,
go to Carrot’s and tell him...

970
01:28:44,326 --> 01:28:49,695
Li’l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he’ll leave you alone.

971
01:28:50,332 --> 01:28:53,199
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

972
01:28:53,402 --> 01:28:56,064
Grab the kid!

973
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:03,905
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.

974
01:29:04,113 --> 01:29:07,378
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

975
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,985
Drugs aren't my thing.

976
01:29:11,186 --> 01:29:13,314
This is just something
between me and him.

977
01:29:13,521 --> 01:29:18,185
Those guys aren’t worth shit.

978
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,989
They'll do anything for power.

979
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:24,530
Like that kid.

980
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:28,863
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

981
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,335
What’s in your head, kid?

982
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:33,974
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...

983
01:29:34,176 --> 01:29:38,408
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

984
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:46,548
-Are you crazy? You’re just a kid.
-A kid? I smoke, snort...

985
01:29:46,755 --> 01:29:50,054
I’ve killed and robbed.
I’m a man.

986
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,783
Shit, you have no idea!

987
01:29:52,994 --> 01:29:56,225
He’s attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

988
01:29:56,431 --> 01:30:01,300
-Shall we kill him?
-Steak, we're going to grind you.

989
01:30:02,904 --> 01:30:07,136
-Okay, I accept.
-Great!

990
01:30:07,342 --> 01:30:11,438
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

991
01:30:11,646 --> 01:30:17,846
But on one condition:
no killing of innocent people.

992
01:30:19,488 --> 01:30:22,082
I can't accept that, understand?

993
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:26,954
Okay, no innocent people.

994
01:30:28,363 --> 01:30:33,300
Steak fucked up!

995
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:47,573
-Have you a gun for me?
-No...

996
01:30:47,783 --> 01:30:51,184
but we can hold up
a gun store.

997
01:30:51,386 --> 01:30:53,445
That’s no problem.

998
01:30:53,655 --> 01:30:57,251
I don’t want to hold up anything.
I’m not a hoodlum.

999
01:30:57,458 --> 01:31:00,655
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1000
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:03,594
I’m not a hoodlum.

1001
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:07,935
He raped your chick...

1002
01:31:08,136 --> 01:31:11,970
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...

1003
01:31:12,173 --> 01:31:15,541
and you killed one of his guys.

1004
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:23,510
If you’re not a hood,
then get out.

1005
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:33,027
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

1006
01:31:34,194 --> 01:31:36,685
This is a hold-up!

1007
01:31:44,738 --> 01:31:48,367
-The first time...
-Where are the revolvers?

1008
01:31:48,576 --> 01:31:52,204
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.

1009
01:31:52,412 --> 01:31:56,815
We said no killing!

1010
01:31:57,018 --> 01:31:58,814
That’s the rule.

1011
01:32:00,054 --> 01:32:05,287
We want the boss’ money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!

1012
01:32:05,493 --> 01:32:08,394
You want us to go?
We do too.

1013
01:32:08,595 --> 01:32:11,029
So hurry up!

1014
01:32:12,266 --> 01:32:14,666
-Look at the ground!
-The second time...

1015
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:16,802
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

1016
01:32:19,573 --> 01:32:22,701
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

1017
01:32:23,344 --> 01:32:25,676
Exception to the rule.

1018
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,974
-Are you the manager?
-Yes.

1019
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:33,176
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1020
01:32:33,387 --> 01:32:35,412
On the ground!

1021
01:32:35,622 --> 01:32:39,854
Give me the money!

1022
01:32:42,796 --> 01:32:45,026
I’m not kidding.

1023
01:32:45,233 --> 01:32:47,462
The first person who moves
is dead!

1024
01:32:47,868 --> 01:32:51,497
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.

1025
01:33:07,287 --> 01:33:11,656
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li’l Z'.

1026
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:14,657
Carrot could protect his
business.

1027
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:16,692
Knockout Ned...

1028
01:33:16,898 --> 01:33:19,833
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.

1029
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:24,231
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

1030
01:33:24,972 --> 01:33:27,202
-Let me see.
-Not bad, eh?

1031
01:33:27,408 --> 01:33:32,106
-The sight isn’t well-aligned.
-I’ll give you a good price.

1032
01:33:32,913 --> 01:33:34,904
The 12 mm, the "hand job".

1033
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,778
See why?

1034
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:40,045
An Uzi, 9 mm. It’s Israeli.

1035
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:43,121
-The star of David.
-Jewish.

1036
01:33:43,323 --> 01:33:44,688
I want a 30-06.

1037
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:47,524
Now we can start having fun.

1038
01:33:47,729 --> 01:33:52,063
The war’s on.
Let’s start with a prayer.

1039
01:33:52,432 --> 01:33:56,528
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...

1040
01:33:56,738 --> 01:34:00,902
Our will be done...

1041
01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:03,932
On earth as it is in heaven...

1042
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:19,250
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1043
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,587
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li’l Z”s gang.

1044
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:27,927
Li’l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.

1045
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:34,802
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

1046
01:34:38,746 --> 01:34:44,445
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.

1047
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:47,753
Great photo!

1048
01:34:47,954 --> 01:34:50,422
I bet it’s by Rogerio Reis.

1049
01:34:50,992 --> 01:34:53,824
What did I tell you?

1050
01:34:54,028 --> 01:34:56,222
Like any pro...

1051
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:59,866
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1052
01:35:00,068 --> 01:35:03,525
Without knowing what awaited me.

1053
01:35:05,172 --> 01:35:08,141
Instead of going home
I’d go over to the paper.

1054
01:35:08,341 --> 01:35:11,708
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

1055
01:35:11,912 --> 01:35:14,779
Check this out.

1056
01:35:14,981 --> 01:35:19,042
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.

1057
01:35:19,252 --> 01:35:20,880
-Hi, Rogerio.
-How are you, Pierre?

1058
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,716
This is Rocket.
He’s a photographer.

1059
01:35:23,925 --> 01:35:25,085
Hello, Rocket.

1060
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:27,556
-He’s a fan of yours.
-Really?

1061
01:35:27,761 --> 01:35:29,389
You have good taste, Rocket!

1062
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:32,690
-Well, I’m done. I’m off.
-See you.

1063
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:35,561
What a cool guy!

1064
01:35:36,369 --> 01:35:39,463
What should have been
a swift revenge...

1065
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:42,164
turned into an all-out war.

1066
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,510
The City of God was divided.

1067
01:35:49,716 --> 01:35:53,516
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.

1068
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,950
Not even to visit a relative.

1069
01:35:56,157 --> 01:35:59,887
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

1070
01:36:00,094 --> 01:36:03,529
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

1071
01:36:07,734 --> 01:36:12,694
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

1072
01:36:12,907 --> 01:36:13,895
This kid...

1073
01:36:14,108 --> 01:36:16,837
-What do you want?
-A boy from Carrot’s gang punched me.

1074
01:36:17,377 --> 01:36:18,742
The war was
an excuse for everything.

1075
01:36:19,146 --> 01:36:21,114
One of Li’l Z”s soldiers
kicked me.

1076
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,175
Take this .22.

1077
01:36:26,988 --> 01:36:29,456
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

1078
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:31,056
Li’l Z’ evicted my family.

1079
01:36:32,092 --> 01:36:33,720
Kill... Be respected.

1080
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:51,568
-I’m Thiago, a friend of Benny’s.
-Can you read? Can you add?

1081
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:57,217
-I’m pretty good in business.
-Okay, get to work.

1082
01:36:57,717 --> 01:37:01,085
-What do you want?
-To get my father’s murderer.

1083
01:37:01,488 --> 01:37:04,252
-What’s your name?
-My name’s Otto.

1084
01:37:09,697 --> 01:37:11,664
What’s the matter?

1085
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:15,824
-He’s a worker.
-But he wants a gun.

1086
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:19,233
He won’t last a week.

1087
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:35,086
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.

1088
01:37:35,288 --> 01:37:36,619
Take that!

1089
01:37:39,426 --> 01:37:45,365
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...

1090
01:37:45,565 --> 01:37:49,092
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.

1091
01:38:10,925 --> 01:38:14,122
I smoke, snort,
I’ve killed and robbed.

1092
01:38:14,328 --> 01:38:16,660
I’m a man.

1093
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:43,347
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.

1094
01:38:57,305 --> 01:39:01,708
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.

1095
01:39:01,908 --> 01:39:03,637
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1096
01:39:03,844 --> 01:39:07,244
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1097
01:39:07,448 --> 01:39:09,677
Our reporter interviewed him.

1098
01:39:09,884 --> 01:39:13,842
-Is the war still going on?
-It's still going on.

1099
01:39:14,121 --> 01:39:18,649
-Have many people died?
-Many have died.

1100
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:20,986
Mostly innocent people.

1101
01:39:21,194 --> 01:39:24,561
Just knowing me is enough...

1102
01:39:24,765 --> 01:39:29,498
to get you killed by Li’l Z'.

1103
01:39:29,703 --> 01:39:33,070
-The police don’t go in there?
-They go after me, not him.

1104
01:39:33,274 --> 01:39:39,611
I’ve been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.

1105
01:39:39,814 --> 01:39:41,907
And they don’t arrest him.

1106
01:39:42,115 --> 01:39:44,413
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1107
01:39:44,618 --> 01:39:50,215
Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1108
01:39:58,698 --> 01:40:00,427
Motherfucker!

1109
01:40:00,634 --> 01:40:04,194
I’m the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1110
01:40:04,404 --> 01:40:07,965
-Have you found mine?
-Just Knockout Ned’s.

1111
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:09,641
Keep looking.

1112
01:40:10,043 --> 01:40:12,773
At least my name’s
got to be in there.

1113
01:40:12,979 --> 01:40:14,674
-There’s nothing.
-Can you read?

1114
01:40:14,881 --> 01:40:17,315
Just the pictures.

1115
01:40:18,284 --> 01:40:20,344
Nothing.

1116
01:40:20,554 --> 01:40:23,648
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:40:23,858 --> 01:40:28,989
-It’s just the want ads.
-I don’t care, read everything!

1118
01:40:29,195 --> 01:40:33,359
-But there aren’t any articles.
-Want a bullet in your head?

1119
01:40:35,368 --> 01:40:38,860
Gotta show them who’s boss here.

1120
01:40:43,911 --> 01:40:47,608
-Give me the camera!
-No way!

1121
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:52,483
Take my picture, man.

1122
01:40:53,087 --> 01:40:55,817
I can’t work it.

1123
01:40:56,023 --> 01:40:57,717
Go ahead.

1124
01:40:58,091 --> 01:41:02,653
-I’ll hold the Beretta.
-Let me try...

1125
01:41:03,296 --> 01:41:05,992
Back off...

1126
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:10,465
-There’s no click.
-What a bunch of bozos!

1127
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:13,734
I’m fucked with you guys.

1128
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:18,370
I have an idea.

1129
01:41:18,578 --> 01:41:23,106
I’ll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1130
01:41:23,984 --> 01:41:27,886
-Here he is.
-Take the camera.

1131
01:41:28,588 --> 01:41:31,023
Well, kid?

1132
01:41:32,091 --> 01:41:37,496
Aren’t you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can’t do it.

1133
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,096
Take our picture.

1134
01:41:46,039 --> 01:41:49,840
-You fucking broke it.
-It wasn’t me.

1135
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:52,105
I found it.

1136
01:41:53,948 --> 01:41:56,109
It has to be wound.

1137
01:42:00,554 --> 01:42:03,546
-What’s your name?
-Rocket.

1138
01:42:03,923 --> 01:42:07,859
-Another picture, Rocket.
-How about two rows?

1139
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:12,965
-What?
-Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1140
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:17,761
-You’re outside, for Christ’s sake!
-Talk to him nicely, kid.

1141
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:19,905
Sorry. Move in, please.

1142
01:42:22,408 --> 01:42:24,876
Another one.

1143
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,547
-I think the roll’s finished.
-Then show us the pictures.

1144
01:42:31,752 --> 01:42:34,619
-They have to be developed.
-Developed?

1145
01:42:35,855 --> 01:42:37,516
How much is it?

1146
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:42,528
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1147
01:42:42,729 --> 01:42:47,996
-I have to remove the film.
-Keep the camera.

1148
01:42:48,502 --> 01:42:52,905
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn’t he? So, it’s yours...

1149
01:42:53,106 --> 01:42:54,938
Thanks.

1150
01:42:56,877 --> 01:43:01,075
Don’t forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

1151
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:14,490
-Pierre!
-What?

1152
01:43:14,895 --> 01:43:18,262
Can you develop this for me?

1153
01:43:18,966 --> 01:43:22,423
I can’t, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1154
01:43:22,636 --> 01:43:25,365
It’s only for the paper’s reporters.
I could risk my job.

1155
01:43:25,573 --> 01:43:27,063
-Pierre?
-Yes, Rogerio?

1156
01:43:27,274 --> 01:43:31,904
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

1157
01:43:32,313 --> 01:43:34,679
I’m going to lunch.

1158
01:43:34,881 --> 01:43:38,977
You’re lucky. What size?

1159
01:43:39,185 --> 01:43:42,586
-What?
-For the enlargement, what size?

1160
01:43:43,056 --> 01:43:46,856
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1161
01:44:06,646 --> 01:44:08,774
-Here.
-Thanks.

1162
01:44:12,653 --> 01:44:15,315
I’m in deep shit now.

1163
01:44:17,224 --> 01:44:19,748
I’m as good as dead.

1164
01:44:31,005 --> 01:44:33,097
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1165
01:44:33,306 --> 01:44:36,764
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1166
01:44:42,448 --> 01:44:46,077
Are you Marina?
Because of you I’m dead.

1167
01:44:46,286 --> 01:44:48,413
You stole my photos.

1168
01:44:48,622 --> 01:44:52,490
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

1169
01:44:53,793 --> 01:44:56,318
Not so loud?
I’ll be killed because of you.

1170
01:44:56,529 --> 01:44:59,090
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1171
01:44:59,298 --> 01:45:02,131
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...

1172
01:45:02,336 --> 01:45:05,134
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1173
01:45:05,338 --> 01:45:08,604
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1174
01:45:08,809 --> 01:45:11,208
-You stole them.
-I did not. Here they are.

1175
01:45:11,412 --> 01:45:15,780
-Give them to me.
-Just a second.

1176
01:45:15,983 --> 01:45:19,110
Here are your photos.

1177
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:23,085
-Are there any others?
-Calm down. What’s your name?

1178
01:45:23,524 --> 01:45:26,584
-Rocket.
-Rocket?

1179
01:45:27,293 --> 01:45:29,693
Nice to meet you.
I’m Marina.

1180
01:45:29,896 --> 01:45:35,391
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1181
01:45:35,802 --> 01:45:40,831
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

1182
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:44,067
-Do you want to be a photographer?
-Yes.

1183
01:45:44,278 --> 01:45:48,146
-Great start! On the front page.
-How’d you get these photos?

1184
01:45:48,347 --> 01:45:49,905
-I live there.
-Rocket...

1185
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:54,353
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

1186
01:45:55,823 --> 01:46:00,453
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li’l Z’...

1187
01:46:00,661 --> 01:46:05,689
the paper would buy them.
We’d pay you.

1188
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:07,958
Could you?

1189
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:10,032
I don’t know.

1190
01:46:10,337 --> 01:46:11,702
What’s the problem?

1191
01:46:11,904 --> 01:46:14,737
The problem? I can’t go there
anymore at night.

1192
01:46:14,942 --> 01:46:19,207
-And during the day?
-It’s too risky.

1193
01:46:20,814 --> 01:46:26,343
Look, man! They’ve finally
understood that I’m the boss.

1194
01:46:27,988 --> 01:46:29,784
What’s your
photographer-friend’s name?

1195
01:46:29,989 --> 01:46:31,217
Rocket.

1196
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:34,622
He’s good. I’ll take more
to show the others.

1197
01:46:37,797 --> 01:46:41,063
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1198
01:46:43,337 --> 01:46:46,306
It’s a great opportunity.

1199
01:46:48,242 --> 01:46:49,641
Okay.

1200
01:46:50,877 --> 01:46:55,473
-You made the right choice. Very good!
-I’ll give you some film, lenses...

1201
01:46:55,681 --> 01:47:01,381
and even another camera.
I’ll show you the equipment room.

1202
01:47:01,587 --> 01:47:04,853
There’s another problem.

1203
01:47:05,057 --> 01:47:08,083
-What is it?
-Where can I sleep tonight?

1204
01:47:08,862 --> 01:47:11,524
I can’t go back now.

1205
01:47:14,368 --> 01:47:18,862
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1206
01:47:19,072 --> 01:47:20,060
Far away.

1207
01:47:20,541 --> 01:47:23,065
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.

1208
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:27,976
Aren’t you too close?

1209
01:47:30,149 --> 01:47:34,018
I don’t know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.

1210
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,415
Maybe I was going to die...

1211
01:47:36,622 --> 01:47:40,023
but now I had a camera...

1212
01:47:40,226 --> 01:47:42,922
and a chance to become
a photographer.

1213
01:47:43,497 --> 01:47:45,896
Watch out for the dog shit.

1214
01:47:46,332 --> 01:47:49,563
Not to mention that
the night was still young...

1215
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:53,137
-Want something to eat?
-No thank you, ma'am.

1216
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:59,039
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

1217
01:48:00,314 --> 01:48:02,077
Try this...

1218
01:48:20,868 --> 01:48:22,995
It’s time to go to sleep.

1219
01:48:25,037 --> 01:48:28,370
I’ll show you your bed.

1220
01:48:28,574 --> 01:48:31,600
-You have hot water, don’t you?
-Yes.

1221
01:48:31,811 --> 01:48:34,302
You’ve never taken a hot shower?

1222
01:48:34,514 --> 01:48:36,743
-No.
-What do you do?

1223
01:48:36,949 --> 01:48:40,180
We heat up the kettle.

1224
01:48:40,386 --> 01:48:44,255
-Why are you standing there?
-What room do I sleep in?

1225
01:48:44,457 --> 01:48:50,589
Unfortunately, there’s only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1226
01:48:50,796 --> 01:48:54,459
I won’t go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

1227
01:48:54,667 --> 01:48:57,761
Just relax...

1228
01:48:58,372 --> 01:49:00,271
Because, elsewhere...

1229
01:49:00,474 --> 01:49:05,137
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.

1230
01:49:06,579 --> 01:49:08,877
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...

1231
01:49:09,082 --> 01:49:11,710
without firing a shot.

1232
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:19,149
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.

1233
01:49:19,826 --> 01:49:20,917
And in the meantime...

1234
01:49:21,127 --> 01:49:24,528
to eliminate Carrot, Li’l Z'
was investing in munitions.

1235
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:27,460
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn’t pay...

1236
01:49:28,766 --> 01:49:32,167
-Remember the double-barrel?
-I already have it.

1237
01:49:32,371 --> 01:49:37,137
This is a repeater rifle. You don’t have
this one, the Browning.

1238
01:49:37,376 --> 01:49:40,436
-It’ll shoot down a plane.
-I’m not shooting down planes.

1239
01:49:40,645 --> 01:49:43,944
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1240
01:49:44,716 --> 01:49:47,583
You can’t get them in Brazil.

1241
01:49:47,786 --> 01:49:49,777
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1242
01:49:52,724 --> 01:49:54,953
I have a solution.

1243
01:49:55,159 --> 01:49:56,854
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1244
01:49:57,061 --> 01:50:01,590
It’s like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1245
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:05,201
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1246
01:50:05,404 --> 01:50:08,237
-It depends.
-It depends, my ass!

1247
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:11,000
Trying to fuck me over?

1248
01:50:11,342 --> 01:50:13,207
I’ll fuck you over first.

1249
01:50:13,412 --> 01:50:16,313
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

1250
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:20,043
-What do I tell the boss?
-That’s your problem.

1251
01:50:20,252 --> 01:50:24,416
-You’ll think of something.
-You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1252
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:28,155
Beat it, fatso.

1253
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:29,917
Li’l Z' had made a big mistake.

1254
01:50:30,128 --> 01:50:34,429
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.

1255
01:50:34,632 --> 01:50:36,862
And they don't joke around.

1256
01:50:38,369 --> 01:50:40,930
Have you seen this?

1257
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:43,706
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1258
01:50:43,908 --> 01:50:46,877
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1259
01:50:47,078 --> 01:50:49,342
They’ll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1260
01:50:49,547 --> 01:50:54,177
Think I’m going
to give you away?

1261
01:50:57,355 --> 01:50:59,949
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

1262
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:02,319
But don’t fuck up again.

1263
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,261
Charlie!

1264
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:13,869
Come here!

1265
01:51:14,072 --> 01:51:15,630
Listen...

1266
01:51:15,841 --> 01:51:18,537
you tell him...

1267
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:23,440
Let’s go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1268
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,188
Come here, kids!

1269
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:42,791
-Do you like chicken?
-It depends.

1270
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:46,402
We’ll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1271
01:51:46,604 --> 01:51:49,937
I have a present for you.

1272
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:53,704
Here...

1273
01:51:55,546 --> 01:51:57,537
A big one for you.

1274
01:51:57,748 --> 01:51:59,773
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1275
01:51:59,984 --> 01:52:04,717
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1276
01:52:04,922 --> 01:52:07,652
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1277
01:52:07,859 --> 01:52:10,555
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

1278
01:52:10,761 --> 01:52:12,558
-More or less.
-More or less?

1279
01:52:12,764 --> 01:52:18,225
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

1280
01:52:19,738 --> 01:52:21,729
I know. You do it like this.

1281
01:52:27,878 --> 01:52:30,278
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1282
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:39,979
Get that chicken!

1283
01:52:53,271 --> 01:52:54,466
C'mon, let’s go.

1284
01:52:54,672 --> 01:52:56,606
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

1285
01:52:58,609 --> 01:53:01,476
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.

1286
01:53:09,354 --> 01:53:12,619
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1287
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:16,750
Shit! The cops!

1288
01:53:16,962 --> 01:53:19,021
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1289
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:21,095
Give me that.

1290
01:53:32,344 --> 01:53:34,710
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1291
01:53:34,912 --> 01:53:38,040
Get the hell out of here!

1292
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,614
Coward!

1293
01:53:39,818 --> 01:53:41,842
Asshole!

1294
01:53:42,787 --> 01:53:45,722
Come on, let them kill each other.

1295
01:53:45,923 --> 01:53:48,653
They can fuck themselves.

1296
01:53:56,801 --> 01:53:59,292
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1297
01:54:00,706 --> 01:54:03,003
What are you waiting for?

1298
01:54:24,595 --> 01:54:26,358
What’s happening?

1299
01:54:26,731 --> 01:54:28,131
Shit!

1300
01:54:41,212 --> 01:54:43,112
Let’s go!

1301
01:55:15,146 --> 01:55:17,809
Run! Run!

1302
01:55:18,015 --> 01:55:20,882
Watch out!

1303
01:55:21,086 --> 01:55:24,078
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1304
01:55:43,742 --> 01:55:46,176
Knockout Ned!

1305
01:55:59,957 --> 01:56:02,755
Take it easy. Don’t move.

1306
01:56:02,961 --> 01:56:04,690
It hurts, man.

1307
01:56:04,895 --> 01:56:07,456
Easy does it, kid.

1308
01:56:08,466 --> 01:56:11,128
Why did you join this fucking war?

1309
01:56:11,336 --> 01:56:14,065
Knockout Ned!
Li’l Z’ has been hit. Come on!

1310
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:18,431
Wait here, I’ll help you.
Just hold on.

1311
01:56:27,652 --> 01:56:31,952
-What's your name?
-My name's Otto.

1312
01:56:38,997 --> 01:56:41,989
I want to get my father’s murderer.

1313
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:09,059
Knockout Ned! Li’l Z’ has been hit.
Come on!

1314
01:57:10,427 --> 01:57:14,761
I’ll help you.
Just hold on there.

1315
01:57:53,904 --> 01:57:57,237
The fucking cops!

1316
01:57:57,442 --> 01:57:58,875
On the ground!

1317
01:57:59,077 --> 01:58:00,976
-Hands over your head.
-Don't move!

1318
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:15,523
-You’re the one I want.
-You’re finished, pal.

1319
01:58:15,726 --> 01:58:17,786
Handcuff him.

1320
01:58:34,779 --> 01:58:36,337
Rocket, where are you going?

1321
01:58:36,547 --> 01:58:39,015
I got something to clear up.

1322
01:59:10,414 --> 01:59:11,939
Okay, lovebirds?

1323
01:59:12,149 --> 01:59:15,846
Come on, Li’l Z',
let’s go settle our scores.

1324
01:59:16,688 --> 01:59:20,783
Not you. You’re a present
for the media.

1325
01:59:56,895 --> 01:59:58,328
Does it come to 10,000?

1326
01:59:58,529 --> 02:00:01,590
Almost. That’s all I have.

1327
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:05,167
-That’s all there was, Chief.
-We searched everywhere.

1328
02:00:05,369 --> 02:00:07,860
Let him go.

1329
02:00:12,277 --> 02:00:15,177
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1330
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:21,284
Fill it up. You’ll owe us
the rest.

1331
02:00:25,055 --> 02:00:27,285
Fucking war!

1332
02:00:29,527 --> 02:00:32,087
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1333
02:00:32,296 --> 02:00:34,560
You're fucked, eh?

1334
02:00:34,765 --> 02:00:36,027
Kids...

1335
02:00:36,234 --> 02:00:40,136
we’ll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1336
02:00:40,337 --> 02:00:43,273
-Your business, Li’l Z’?
-What’s your problem, kid?

1337
02:00:43,475 --> 02:00:46,137
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1338
02:00:46,344 --> 02:00:47,868
A Soviet attack!

1339
02:00:55,185 --> 02:00:58,121
The business is ours!

1340
02:01:51,909 --> 02:01:56,210
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.

1341
02:01:58,550 --> 02:02:00,414
This one will make me famous.

1342
02:02:00,618 --> 02:02:03,382
It’ll even make the cover
of a magazine.

1343
02:02:05,689 --> 02:02:09,284
I won’t have to worry
about Li’l Z' anymore.

1344
02:02:11,229 --> 02:02:13,925
But the cops?

1345
02:02:21,271 --> 02:02:25,708
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED "BOSS"
OF THE CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

1346
02:02:28,145 --> 02:02:32,741
This photo could’ve gotten
us killed?

1347
02:02:32,951 --> 02:02:34,509
I think so.

1348
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,414
At least it got you a job.

1349
02:02:37,622 --> 02:02:41,456
-Not a job, an internship.
-It pays a little, doesn’t it?

1350
02:02:41,658 --> 02:02:44,092
A little.

1351
02:02:44,362 --> 02:02:47,331
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1352
02:02:47,532 --> 02:02:49,898
-More or less.
-You didn’t like it?

1353
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:52,534
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.

1354
02:02:52,737 --> 02:02:53,725
Yeah, I guess so.

1355
02:02:53,938 --> 02:02:56,304
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.

1356
02:02:56,506 --> 02:02:58,098
Better kill him.

1357
02:02:58,309 --> 02:02:59,970
Who shot Roger?

1358
02:03:00,177 --> 02:03:02,510
-It was Beef.
-Kill that fucker.

1359
02:03:02,713 --> 02:03:05,079
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

1360
02:03:05,283 --> 02:03:08,775
-What about Cherry?
-Let’s go. Us two, and 3 others...

1361
02:03:08,987 --> 02:03:10,851
It’s a deal.

1362
02:03:11,055 --> 02:03:13,649
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1363
02:03:13,858 --> 02:03:17,157
No, but if they come,
we’ll kill them.

1364
02:03:17,528 --> 02:03:21,793
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, sort of.

1365
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:25,032
Let’s make a black list.
We’ll kill them all.

1366
02:03:25,235 --> 02:03:28,796
-Put fucking Nightowl on there.
-And Croquet.

1367
02:03:29,006 --> 02:03:30,530
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1368
02:03:30,742 --> 02:03:32,676
And China-Man,
he thinks he’s hot stuff.

1369
02:03:32,877 --> 02:03:35,869
-And Claudio.
-Where’s Giant?

1370
02:03:36,079 --> 02:03:38,809
Come on, Giant!

1371
02:03:53,264 --> 02:03:56,926
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1372
02:03:57,135 --> 02:03:59,364
BASED ON A REAL STORY
I’m now Wilson Rodrigues...

1373
02:03:59,569 --> 02:04:01,264
photographer.

1374
02:04:22,292 --> 02:04:24,089
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1375
02:04:24,295 --> 02:04:27,389
was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1376
02:04:27,597 --> 02:04:30,590
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.

1377
02:04:30,801 --> 02:04:33,862
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

1378
02:04:34,072 --> 02:04:37,701
Just knowing me is enough...

1379
02:04:37,908 --> 02:04:41,742
just being my friend...

1380
02:04:41,945 --> 02:04:45,881
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.

1381
02:04:46,083 --> 02:04:47,983
The police don’t go in there?

1382
02:04:48,185 --> 02:04:53,555
They go after me, not him.

1383
02:04:53,757 --> 02:04:58,820
I’ve been in jail 3 times,
while he goes on...

1384
02:04:59,029 --> 02:05:01,520
killing undisturbed.

1385
02:05:01,733 --> 02:05:04,395
And they don’t arrest him.

1386
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:07,326
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1387
02:05:07,537 --> 02:05:12,406
Police Chief Guedes has promised to
arrest both gangs in the City of God.
