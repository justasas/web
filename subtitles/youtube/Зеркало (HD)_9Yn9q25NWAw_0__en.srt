"MOSFILM" production

2
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:19,548
What is your name?

3
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:27,559
My name is Yuri Zhary.

4
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,240
Where are you from?

5
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,010
I'm from Kharkov.

6
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:58,181
What school do you go to?

7
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,441
I go to a trade school.

8
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:12,951
We'll begin now.

9
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:16,290
Look at me closely.

10
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,629
Look right into my eyes.

11
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,288
Concentrate on my hand.

12
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:50,501
My hand is drawing you back.

13
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:15,033
Concentrate!

14
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:19,706
Your attention
is on your hands.

15
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,088
Your hands are becoming tense!

16
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:31,054
You're concentrating your
will, your great desire

17
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,724
to succeed on your hands.

18
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,396
Your hands are becoming
very tense.

19
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:48,786
Look at your fingers.
They're becoming tense.

20
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:54,418
The tension from here will
flow to your fingers.

21
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:05,682
When I say "3", your hands
will become rigid.

22
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,106
One, two,

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,694
three! Your hands are rigid.

24
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,115
You can not move your hands.

25
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:21,788
You try to move them,
but can not.

26
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,463
I'll relieve the tension now,

27
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:33,135
and you will speak clearly
and effortlessly.

28
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:41,521
And you will speak loudly and
clearly all your life.

29
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,495
I'll remove the tension from
your hands and speech.

30
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:57,834
One, two,

31
00:03:58,502 --> 00:03:59,838
three!

32
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:05,427
- Say "I can speak".
- I can speak.

THE MIRROR

49
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:18,019
The road from the station
lay through Ignatyevo,

50
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:21,314
turning off near the farm stead,

51
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,694
where we spent our summers
before the war,

52
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:28,700
and then to Tomshino
through a dark oak wood.

53
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,747
We usually recognized
the family,

54
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,753
when they appeared from
behind the bush.

55
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:42,676
If he turns towards
the house, it's Father,

56
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,391
if not, it's not he

57
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,478
which means he'll never
come again.

58
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,752
Is this the road to Tomshino?

59
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,424
You shouldn't have turned
at the bush.

60
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,100
Why're you sitting here?

61
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,896
- I live here.
- Where? On the fence?

62
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:28,778
What interests you: the road
to Tomshino, or where I live?

63
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:34,786
I took everything,
but forgot the key.

64
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:40,793
Would you have a nail
or a screwdriver?

65
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,799
I don't have a nail.

66
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,137
Why are you so nervous?

67
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:51,474
Give me your hand, I'm a doctor.

68
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:58,150
Don't talk, I'm counting!

69
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,527
Must I call my husband?

70
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,324
You've no husband.

71
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,702
You've no wedding ring.

72
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:15,590
Though they are rarely worn
nowadays.

73
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,271
May I have a cigarette?

74
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,171
Why are you so sad?

75
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,854
Why are you so happy?

76
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:01,649
It's nice to fall in love
with a pretty woman.

77
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,331
Look at these roots,

78
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,379
these bushes...

79
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:22,343
Did you ever wonder about plants

80
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:27,683
feeling, being aware,

81
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:31,230
perceiving even...

82
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:36,363
The trees, this beechnut...

83
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,033
- It's alder.
- It doesn't matter.

84
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:42,746
They are in no hurry.

85
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:45,708
While we rush around

86
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,046
and speak in platitudes.

87
00:09:55,638 --> 00:10:00,311
It's because we don't trust
our inner natures.

88
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:06,318
That's all this doubt, haste,

89
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,865
lack of time to stop and think.

90
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:14,578
Do you have...

91
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:20,211
Have no fear. I'm a doctor,
you know.

92
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,342
What of "Ward N6"?

93
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:28,514
It's all Chekhov's invention!

94
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:33,855
Come to Tomshino.

95
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:38,527
- We've jolly times here.
- You are bleeding!

96
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:47,283
We celebrated each moment
of our meetings

97
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:50,621
as a revelation.

98
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,291
Alone in all the world.

99
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,297
You were lighter and bolder
than the wing of a bird.

100
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,634
Plying down the stairs,
two at a time

101
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,639
Pure giddiness, leading me
through moist lilac

102
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,312
To your domain
Beyond the looking-glass.

103
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,982
When night fell

104
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,653
I was favoured

105
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:17,324
The altar gates were opened,

106
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,994
and the dark there gleamed

107
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,331
Your nudity and
slowly bowed

108
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,668
Awakening, "Be blessed"
I said

109
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:30,006
And knew my blessing
to be bold

110
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:32,676
For you still slept

111
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,346
To touch your lids
with heavenly blue

112
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:38,018
The lilac on the table
stretched forth

113
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,687
And your blue tinted lids

114
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:44,024
Were calm and your hand
was warm

115
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,490
Locked in crystal
rivers pulsed,

116
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:52,119
Mountains smoked,
seas glimmered.

117
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:55,833
You held a sphere
of crystal

118
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,587
In your hand and slept
on your throne.

119
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,508
And Righteous Lord!
You were mine.

120
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,970
You awakened and transformed

121
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:08,306
Our mundane, human words;

122
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,644
Then did my throat fill
with new power

123
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:14,982
And gave new meaning to
"you"

124
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,987
Which now meant "Sovereign".

125
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:21,657
All was transformed even

126
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,995
Such simple things as basin,
pitcher, - when

127
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:28,334
Like a sentinel layered
solid water

128
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,295
Lay between us.

129
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:34,342
We were drawn on and on

130
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,678
Where cities built by magic

131
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:40,348
Parted before us
like mirages.

132
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,020
Mint carpeted our way,

133
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,690
Birds escorted us

134
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,110
And fishes swam upstream,

135
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,698
While the sky spread out
before us,

136
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:55,244
As fate followed
in our wake.

137
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,415
Like a madman brandishing
a razor.

138
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:31,208
It's a fire, but don't shout.

139
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,611
What if Vitya's there?
What if he's burned to death?

140
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:55,907
Where's Klanya?

141
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:07,620
Dad.

142
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:19,831
Why are you hoarse?

143
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,629
Don't worry. It's probably
a strep throat.

144
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,175
I haven't spoken for 3 days.

145
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:31,847
Being silent for a while
is good.

146
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,853
Words can't really express

147
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:39,858
a person's emotions.
They're too inert.

148
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:45,324
I just dreamed of you, mama.

149
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,993
I was a child in my dream.

150
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:52,458
By the way, when did father
leave us?

151
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:58,423
In 1935... Why?

152
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:05,058
And the fire? Remember when
the barn burned down?

153
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:08,395
That was in 1935, too.

154
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:13,277
There's something I wanted
to tell you...

155
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:17,281
You know, Liza died.

156
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:24,791
She worked
at the printing house, too.

157
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,594
- When?
- This morning.

158
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:38,810
What time is it now?
What's it now?

159
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:45,486
It's nearly 6...
What's the matter with you?

160
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,829
Why are we forever
quarrelling?

161
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:56,167
Forgive me, if I'm to blame.

162
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:01,122
Where are the proofs
I was reading?

163
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:03,834
I don't know.

164
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:30,536
Do you hear the evening proofs?

165
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,540
The Goslit edition? Relax!

166
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,421
I'll look in the cabinet.

167
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,759
It's not that terrible.

168
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:55,277
But it's a special edition!

169
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:04,622
No edition should have
misprints.

170
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,670
- Anything wrong?
- Not really.

171
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:17,384
I want to see...
Maybe I'm mistaken...

172
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:23,643
I'll find it myself.

173
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,980
Everyone's always in a rush!

174
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,118
You think I'm afraid?

175
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,788
Sure, let others worry.

176
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,752
Someone work and others can worry.

177
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,487
Well, what is it?

178
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:07,826
If it's something,
it's already run off.

179
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,635
I waited for you all day long
yesterday.

180
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,597
They guessed, that
you wouldn't come.

181
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:31,269
Remember the weather?

182
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:34,522
As at a holiday!
I did not even wear a coat.

183
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:37,401
Today you came, but we've
been granted

184
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:40,572
A day of such gloom,

185
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:44,076
And rain and an hour so late.

186
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:47,414
With drops running down
the cold boughs.

187
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,755
That words will not stop,
They can't be wiped away...

188
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,920
See? There's no misprint.

189
00:29:24,337 --> 00:29:27,509
No... But it was such
an improper word.

190
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:30,846
Then why're you crying?

191
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:37,146
I could actually see the word
in print.

192
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,396
It's alcohol. It'll do you good.

193
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,778
You all drenched.

194
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:16,740
Yes, I am.

195
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,872
I'll go to take a shower.

196
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:32,219
Know whom you look like?

197
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:37,518
- Maria Timofeevna.
- Who's Maria Timofeevna?

198
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,366
Tell me simply: who's she?

199
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:54,038
Captain Lebyadkin's sister.

200
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:03,384
You are amazingly like her.

201
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,848
In what way?

202
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:13,982
After all it's Dostoevsky...
no matter what you say...

203
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:19,780
Lebyadkin, fetch me some
water! Hand me my shoes!

204
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:21,659
The difference is

205
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:24,870
her brother isn't bringing
water but beating for her

206
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:27,332
whereas he thinks
everyone's at her beck.

207
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,543
What're you getting at?

208
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:33,549
Your whole life's just
"fetch me some water!"

209
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,932
It's a show of independence.

210
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:41,602
If something doesn't suit you,

211
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,190
you pretend it doesn't exist.

212
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,280
I'm amazed at your
ex-husband's patience.

213
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,911
He should've bolted ages ago.

214
00:31:58,164 --> 00:32:01,461
Do you ever admit you're
wrong? Never!

215
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,259
You created the whole situation!

216
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:12,725
You can say he escaped

217
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:17,606
in the nick of time,

218
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:20,945
before you managed to make him
like you.

219
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:25,618
Swear you'll make your
children miserable.

220
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:39,594
Stop talking nonsense!

221
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:15,307
Come on, Masha!

222
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,359
Leave me alone!

223
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:31,037
Passing life's half-way mark

224
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:34,582
I lost my way
in a dark wood...

225
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:44,008
I always said you resembled
my mother.

226
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:46,135
That's probably why we broke up.

227
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:51,809
I shrink to see Ignat
becoming like you.

228
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:55,440
Why do you shrink?

229
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:59,445
You and I could never
communicate.

230
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:06,077
When I recall my childhood
and Mother,

231
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:10,835
somehow she always has
your face.

232
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:16,509
But I know why.

233
00:35:16,842 --> 00:35:20,138
I'm sorry for both of you,
you and her.

234
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:26,438
Put the glass back, Ignat!

235
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:36,535
You won't be happy with anyone.

236
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:45,170
You seem to think,

237
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:48,509
that the very fact of your
presence

238
00:35:49,177 --> 00:35:51,179
should make everyone happy.

239
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,850
You can only take.

240
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:57,855
That's because I was
brought up by women.

241
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:01,567
If you don't want Ignat
to be like you,

242
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,862
get married soon.

243
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:09,120
- Whom to?
- I don't know.

244
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:12,206
Or let me have him.

245
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,135
You're to blame for being
on the cuts with your mother.

246
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:29,146
Because she thinks she knows
what's best for me,

247
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,233
or what can make me happy.

248
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:39,827
As for her arid me I feel
it more keenly than you.

249
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,711
We're drifting apart,

250
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,715
and I can't help it.

251
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:16,081
Distract him, Hatalya! He's
talking about Spain again.

252
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,378
It's all end in a row.

253
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:28,097
I wanted to ask you... We're
having the house painted.

254
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:32,103
Ignat would like to stay
with you for a week.

255
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,776
I'll be happy to have him.

256
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,829
What's he saying?

257
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:20,918
He's imitating the famous
matador Palomo Linares.

258
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,878
He was overwhelmed by
the farewell.

259
00:38:57,548 --> 00:39:00,219
The entire city saw him off.

260
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:03,557
His mother couldn't. She was ill.

261
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,188
But his father stood sadly
on the side lines.

262
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:15,155
He knew they were both
thinking the same thought:

263
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,909
Would they ever see each other
again?

264
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,854
You mocking me?
I spent years teaching you,

265
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:43,693
you could never learn,
so you do know now!

266
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:52,621
He was in Spain, but didn't
understand a thing.

267
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:59,922
Don't you ever want
to go back to Spain?

268
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:03,635
I can't. My husband's Russian.

269
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:07,264
My children are Russian.

270
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:19,490
I'll talk to her!

271
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,648
Come here! I'm leaving.

272
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,924
When you're in a hurry,
this always...

273
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,262
Just pick them up.

274
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:03,945
It feels like electricity!

275
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,711
It's like it happened once...

276
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,059
But I've never been here before.

277
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:37,072
Give me the coins and stop
imagining things.

278
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:47,461
And tidy up a bit.

279
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:14,331
Don't touch anything.

280
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:19,128
Tell Maria Nikolayevna
to wait if she comes.

281
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:35,817
Come in. Hello.

282
00:46:41,992 --> 00:46:44,662
A cup of tea for a young man.

283
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:08,652
Get the notebook
on the third shelf.

284
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:22,670
Read the page
where the book mark is.

285
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:33,684
"In replying as to the effect
the arts and sciences have

286
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,106
"on our morals, Rousseau said:
"a negative one"

287
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,947
Just read what's underlined.
We have no time.

288
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:55,045
"The division of the churches
separated us from Europe.

289
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:57,800
"We did not take part in

"Russia and its vast expanses

"absorbed the Mongol invasion.

294
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:22,999
"The Tatars didn't dare

"and left us behind in the rear.
They returned to deserts,

296
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,635

00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:37,602

00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,615

00:48:49,617 --> 00:48:52,288
"As for our historic

00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:55,625
"I cannot agree with you.

"as God oriented it".

313
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:44,523
A letter from Pushkin to
Chaadaev. October 19,1836.

314
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,452
Go, open the door!

315
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,104
Oh, I've got the wrong
appartment.

316
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:21,025
How're things, Ignat?

317
00:51:23,068 --> 00:51:25,072
Did Maria Nikolayevna come?

318
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:29,952
No... a lady came... she had
the wrong apartment...

319
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:32,831
Find something to do,

320
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,670
or invite a friend over.

321
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,093
Are you friends
with guys and girls?

322
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:43,763
Shucks to them!

323
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:48,059
I was in love when I was
your age, during the war...

324
00:51:50,313 --> 00:51:53,818
She was a red head... her lips
were always chapped...

325
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:59,241
Our shell-shocked military
instructor liked her...

326
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:12,045
Where'd you aim at?
Think I didn't see you?

327
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,554
You shot into the air!

328
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:23,226
I didn't do anything,
there's nobody there.

329
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:25,896
What if there was?

330
00:53:27,231 --> 00:53:29,067
There are trees there.

331
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:31,528
What if someone was up
in a tree?

332
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:38,871
About-face! The command was
about-face!

333
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,882
That's what I did.

334
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:50,596
Did you study the manual?

335
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:59,524
About-face is what I did.

336
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:04,822
It means

337
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,702
a 360 turn.

338
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:15,294
Forgot the degrees!
Asafiev! About-face!

339
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:28,938
To your firing positions!
Forward march!

340
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,240
I want to see your parents.

341
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:40,577
What parents?

342
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:52,302
Which firing position?
I don't understand.

343
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,304
Get down!

344
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:58,310
His parents died during
the Leningrad Blockade.

345
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,655
A firing position is...
a firing position.

346
00:55:17,668 --> 00:55:20,338
Tell me the basic parts...
of...

347
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:26,764
...of... a rifle.

348
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:45,496
The stock...

349
00:55:49,043 --> 00:55:50,753
The muzzle...

350
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,047
You're a muzzle.

351
00:56:04,646 --> 00:56:07,067
Then what's a muzzle?

352
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:05,184
Don't!

353
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:06,853
Get down!

354
00:57:46,614 --> 00:57:48,532
It's a dummy.

355
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:11,813
To think you're a Leningrad...

356
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:14,358
Blockade boy...

357
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,595
I trust not promotions.

358
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:17,265
And I fear not omens.

359
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:21,186
I flee not from slander
or poison.

360
01:01:21,938 --> 01:01:23,941
There is no death.

361
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:27,862
We're all immortal -
All is immortal.

362
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:31,284
Fear not death at seventeen,

363
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:35,289
Not at seventy...There's only
reality and light.

364
01:01:35,956 --> 01:01:39,293
There's neither dark, nor
death in this, our world.

365
01:01:39,961 --> 01:01:41,965
We've reached the beach,

366
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,302
And I am one of those,
who pulls the nets in,

367
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:48,639
When immortality arrives
in batches.

368
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:51,309
Live in a house,
and it won't crumble;

369
01:01:51,643 --> 01:01:54,313
I'll summon a century at will,

370
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:57,652
Enter and build my house in it.

371
01:01:58,027 --> 01:02:00,990
That's why your children and
your wives

372
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:03,659
All share my board,

373
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,997
The table serving forefather
and grandson:

374
01:02:07,664 --> 01:02:09,668
The future is decided now.

375
01:02:10,335 --> 01:02:12,338
And if I rise my hand,

376
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:15,675
The five rays will remain
to you.

377
01:02:16,342 --> 01:02:18,929
My bones, like beams

378
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:21,682
Held up each day,

379
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,436
I measured time
with a surveyor's staff,

380
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:28,359
And passed through it
as through the mountains.

381
01:02:28,733 --> 01:02:31,028
I chose a century
according to my height.

382
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:35,034
We pressed on South, raising
dust in the steppes,

383
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:37,704
Weeds smoldered,
A grasshopper played,

384
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:40,375
Touching horseshoes and
prophesying...

385
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,711
Threatening me with death
quite like a monk.

386
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,050
I strapped my fate fast
to my saddle,

387
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:50,387
I rise up in the stirrups

388
01:02:51,054 --> 01:02:53,057
Of the future as a boy.

389
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,395
I am content with my
immortality,

390
01:02:57,063 --> 01:02:59,733
With my blood coursing
from century to century.

391
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,403
I'd gladly give my life

392
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,740
for a safe corner of warmth.

393
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:09,037
If life's swift needle

394
01:03:09,746 --> 01:03:12,416
Did not draw me out,
as though I were a thread.

395
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:29,050
Marusya!

396
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:33,055
Where are the children?

397
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:43,568
I'll tell them
you stole a book.

398
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,336
Tattle-tale!

399
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:01,342
I will, too!

400
01:07:07,766 --> 01:07:09,101
Marina!

401
01:08:32,795 --> 01:08:36,341
Come more often;
you know how he misses you.

402
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:46,104
Let Ignat live here...

403
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:52,822
Are you serious?

404
01:08:53,155 --> 01:08:55,783
You said he'd like to.

405
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:00,748
I have to watch my every word.

406
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,877
Think I suggested it
for my own pleasure?

407
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:09,135
Let's ask him. Let him decide...

408
01:09:11,054 --> 01:09:13,056
It'll be easier on you.

409
01:09:14,641 --> 01:09:16,394
In what way?

410
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,320
Did you get your books together?

411
01:09:26,323 --> 01:09:28,993
Say goodbye to your father.

412
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:34,335
Mama and I wanted to ask you...

413
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,181
Would you rather live here?

414
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:50,981
You spoke to Mama of it,
didn't you?

415
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:57,240
When? What'd I say? No!
Don't want to.

416
01:10:31,743 --> 01:10:34,038
She and I really are alike.

417
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,708
Not at all!

418
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:59,779
What kind of relationship
d'you want with your mother?

419
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:08,291
That of childhood's
impossible now.

420
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:21,516
You speak of feeling guilty,
because she

421
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:25,814
sacrificed her life for you...

422
01:11:26,481 --> 01:11:29,152
There's nothing you can do
about it.

423
01:11:31,404 --> 01:11:34,324
She wants you to be
a child again,

424
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:38,497
so she could take care
of you and protect you.

425
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,842
I'm meddling again...

426
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:50,513
As always...

427
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:04,155
What're you howling about?
Tell me!

428
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:09,747
Should I marry him or not?

429
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:18,800
Do I know him?

430
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,804
No...

431
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:25,475
Is he a Ukrainian?

432
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:28,146
What's that have to do with it?

433
01:12:28,814 --> 01:12:32,819
- What does he do?
- He's a writer.

434
01:12:35,863 --> 01:12:38,826
His name isn't Dostoyevsky,
by any chance?

435
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:46,170
Never wrote a thing, no one
ever heard of him.

436
01:12:46,837 --> 01:12:50,175
Is he about 40?
Then he is a mediocrity.

437
01:12:55,515 --> 01:12:57,518
You've changed so.

438
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:03,234
He has no talent,
doesn't write a thing.

439
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:06,530
He does, but it isn't published.

440
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:11,536
Look, our dear dunce
has started a fire.

441
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,878
Don't be so sarcastic
about his poor marks.

442
01:13:19,546 --> 01:13:22,216
He'll drop out and be drafted,

443
01:13:22,885 --> 01:13:26,222
and you'll try hard
to get him deferred.

444
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:30,226
It's all the results
of your upbringing.

445
01:13:30,895 --> 01:13:33,190
The army won't kill him,
you know.

446
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:36,527
Why don't you phone your mother?

447
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,530
She was ill for three days
after Liza's death.

448
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:43,161
I didn't know.

449
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:47,333
I expected her at 5 today.

450
01:13:48,292 --> 01:13:50,128
Can't you take the first step?

451
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,675
We were talking about Ignat.

452
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:00,266
Maybe I'm to blame, too.

453
01:14:03,771 --> 01:14:06,442
Or have we just became
bourgeois?

454
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:11,030
A primeval Asiatic kind
of bourgeois.

455
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:16,246
Prospering when there's
no private property.

456
01:14:18,707 --> 01:14:20,042
It's incomprehensible.

457
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:22,922
Why are you so irritable?

458
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:26,259
My friends' 15-year-old son
said to them:

459
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,970
"I'm leaving home, I can't stand

460
01:14:29,305 --> 01:14:31,349
"all this hypocrisy."

461
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,478
What a smart boy!
Compared to our booby.

462
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:39,943
Too bad, our son will never
say such a thing.

463
01:14:40,278 --> 01:14:43,115
Some friends you have!

464
01:14:43,532 --> 01:14:47,537
They're no worse than us.
He's a newspaperman.

465
01:14:49,163 --> 01:14:51,542
Thinks he's a writer, too,
by the way.

466
01:14:57,591 --> 01:14:59,636
He just can't understand

467
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:01,931
that a book's a deed,
not a paycheck.

468
01:15:04,184 --> 01:15:06,061
A poet must stir the soul,

469
01:15:07,145 --> 01:15:08,814
not nurture idolaters.

470
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:20,079
But what I'll do?

471
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:23,208
Get married.

472
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:26,547
Do you remember,

473
01:15:26,963 --> 01:15:29,216
whom the angel appeared to
as a burning bush?

474
01:15:32,387 --> 01:15:35,475
No, not to Ignat at any rate.

475
01:15:37,728 --> 01:15:40,148
Should we sent him
to a military school?

476
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:45,237
The angel appeared to Moses.

477
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:54,917
Why didn't anything like
that ever appear to me?

478
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:11,396
I keep having the same dream.

479
01:16:15,277 --> 01:16:17,197
He seems to be forcing me
to return

480
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,829
to the bitter sweet site,

481
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,541
of my grandfather's house,

482
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:29,378
where I was born
on the table 40 years ago.

483
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:39,725
Something always prevents me
from entering.

484
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:46,902
I keep having my dream.

485
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:54,913
When I dream of the log
walls and dark pantry,

486
01:16:57,917 --> 01:17:00,170
I sense that it's only a dream.

487
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:06,594
Then my joy is clouded,
for I know I'll wake up.

488
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:16,065
Sometimes something happens,
and I stop dreaming

489
01:17:17,525 --> 01:17:20,822
of the house and the pines
by the house of my childhood.

490
01:17:22,073 --> 01:17:24,452
Then I grieve

491
01:17:27,037 --> 01:17:30,333
and wait for the dream,

492
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:34,757
that will make me a child again,

493
01:17:36,091 --> 01:17:38,761
and I'll be happy again knowing

494
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:42,099
that all still lies ahead,

495
01:17:44,269 --> 01:17:46,271
and nothing is impossible...

496
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,975
Someone's there, mama.

497
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:19,009
Are you Nadezhda Petrovna?

498
01:21:20,344 --> 01:21:24,350
I'm Matvei Ivanovich's
stepdaughter.

499
01:21:25,434 --> 01:21:27,686
He was a friend of your husband.

500
01:21:33,028 --> 01:21:36,365
He's a doctor.
He used to live here,

501
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:41,038
but then he moved to Yuryevets,
he became a medical expert.

502
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,461
Do you live in the city?

503
01:21:46,962 --> 01:21:50,300
We're from Moscow, but we
have a room in Yuryevets.

504
01:21:57,268 --> 01:21:59,563
We were evacuated last fall.

505
01:22:02,608 --> 01:22:06,614
Moscow was bombed.
I've two children.

506
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,951
My mother has friends here...

507
01:22:14,623 --> 01:22:17,961
My husband's in the city today.

508
01:22:23,176 --> 01:22:25,179
Stop scratching yourself.

509
01:22:26,515 --> 01:22:30,019
I've come to see you.
It's a private matter.

510
01:22:37,194 --> 01:22:40,532
Come in. Don't stand here...

511
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:50,545
Wipe your feet.
Masha washed the floors.

512
01:23:16,454 --> 01:23:20,460
Wait here. I won't be long.

513
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:39,467
Why're you in the dark?
Did it go out?

514
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:44,140
Why didn't you call us?

515
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,561
- What's your name?
- Alyosha.

516
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:56,155
I've a son, too,
but he's a baby.

517
01:27:56,823 --> 01:27:59,493
It's not easy to bring up
children in wartime.

518
01:28:00,161 --> 01:28:02,456
Still I'd like a daughter.

519
01:28:03,372 --> 01:28:06,168
Want to see him? He's sleeping.

520
01:28:06,836 --> 01:28:09,213
He's a darling boy.

521
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:59,029
He asked his father,

522
01:28:59,488 --> 01:29:03,493
why a 5 kopeck coin is bigger
than a 10 kopeck one?

523
01:29:04,162 --> 01:29:08,833
Imagine! My husband
was speechless.

524
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:14,216
He wanted a girl. He even
had a name for her.

525
01:29:17,345 --> 01:29:19,431
I made pink baby clothes.

526
01:29:22,853 --> 01:29:25,523
Then I had to make others.

527
01:29:26,189 --> 01:29:28,192
He gave us quite a bit of
trouble...

528
01:29:33,158 --> 01:29:35,828
Did we wake you up?

529
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:39,666
What a chatterbox
your mother is.

530
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,211
See, who's here?

531
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:45,548
Don't know them?

532
01:29:47,886 --> 01:29:50,222
You can't wake up, can you?

533
01:29:51,556 --> 01:29:55,561
Go back to sleep then, love.

534
01:30:05,574 --> 01:30:08,912
How do I look?
How's the ring?

535
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:15,588
- What's the matter?
- I don't feel well.

536
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,220
You are just tired.
I didn't realize it.

537
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:30,316
I should've put up supper.

538
01:30:32,985 --> 01:30:35,448
Please, don't bother.

539
01:30:38,452 --> 01:30:41,122
We ate before we started out.

540
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:43,791
What a nasty cough.

541
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:52,761
My husband should have
a look at him.

542
01:30:54,139 --> 01:30:58,144
We can't wait. It's
a 2 hour walk back.

543
01:30:58,811 --> 01:31:02,149
What about the earrings?
My husband has the money.

544
01:31:02,817 --> 01:31:06,823
We'll slaughter a cockerel.
But do me a favor...

545
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:11,871
I'm 3 months gone and feel
nauseous all the time.

546
01:31:12,204 --> 01:31:15,082
Even milking the cow
makes me sick.

547
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:18,212
As for the cockerel...

548
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:21,508
Could you?

549
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,179
But I...

550
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,183
You, too?

551
01:31:28,559 --> 01:31:31,896
No, I've just never done it.

552
01:31:32,856 --> 01:31:34,859
There's nothing to it.

553
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,537
I do it here on the block.

554
01:31:44,204 --> 01:31:46,875
Here's the axe. It's very sharp.

555
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:51,547
- Right here?
- Over a basin.

556
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,552
I'll give you a hen tomorrow.

557
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,890
I can't do it.

558
01:31:59,557 --> 01:32:03,564
Perhaps ask Alyosha.
He's a man, after all.

559
01:32:06,234 --> 01:32:08,236
No, not Alyosha.

560
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:14,243
Hold it tight
or it'll wreck the place.

561
01:33:21,373 --> 01:33:24,002
Don't fret.
You'll be all right.

562
01:33:26,256 --> 01:33:27,673
Too bad, I only see you

563
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:30,176
when I'm really sick.

564
01:33:41,818 --> 01:33:43,820
Here I am, born aloft.

565
01:33:44,154 --> 01:33:46,782
What's the matter, Marusya?
Speak to me.

566
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:49,827
Don't be so surprised.

567
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:54,125
I love you.

568
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:57,087
You leaving? But the earrings?

569
01:33:58,422 --> 01:34:00,425
My husband will be back soon.

570
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,763
- He's got the money.
- We changed our minds.

571
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,768
It's 15 miles to town.
It'll be dark soon.

572
01:34:08,435 --> 01:34:10,438
It's all right. Don't worry.

573
01:34:23,706 --> 01:34:27,043
A man has one body,
so solitary.

574
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:30,381
The soul is sick
of this solid sheath

575
01:34:31,048 --> 01:34:34,302
With ears and eyes
The size of buttons.

576
01:34:35,054 --> 01:34:38,391
And skin, a mass of scars,
A skeleton's robe.

577
01:34:39,059 --> 01:34:42,396
Fly through the cornea
To the heavenly spring

578
01:34:43,064 --> 01:34:47,069
To the icy spoke
To the bird's chariot.

579
01:34:47,737 --> 01:34:50,408
Through the prison bars
it hears

580
01:34:51,074 --> 01:34:55,079
The clamour of woods and leaves
The trumpet of the seas.

581
01:34:55,747 --> 01:34:59,752
A soul without a body is like
A body without a shirt,

582
01:35:01,087 --> 01:35:05,094
Not a thought or a deed,
Not a line or a concept.

583
01:35:06,429 --> 01:35:09,766
A riddle that has no answer:
Who'll return

584
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,438
To dance, where there's
No one to dance?

585
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:19,320
I dream of another soul,
Dressed in other garb.

586
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:23,784
It flits from doubt to hope.

587
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:27,789
Burning without a shadow like
alcohol, and slips away.

588
01:35:28,457 --> 01:35:32,462
Leaving a memento
Some lilac on the table.

589
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:37,136
Child, fret not
Over poor Eurydice

590
01:35:37,802 --> 01:35:41,807
But drive your copper hood
Through life,

591
01:35:42,475 --> 01:35:46,480
While in response
To every step

592
01:35:47,149 --> 01:35:51,154
You have the Earth reply,
Merry is its voice and dry.

593
01:38:36,704 --> 01:38:40,042
The stove's smoking, mama.

594
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,198
It all depends on him.

595
01:39:03,573 --> 01:39:07,203
Is a strep throat that
dangerous?

596
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:13,211
What has a strep throat
to do with it?

597
01:39:16,548 --> 01:39:18,551
It's a usual occurrence.

598
01:39:26,561 --> 01:39:30,567
A mother, wife,

599
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:35,574
child die suddenly...

600
01:39:35,907 --> 01:39:38,994
And a person wastes away
in a few days.

601
01:39:39,412 --> 01:39:41,581
But no one died in his family.

602
01:39:46,671 --> 01:39:49,926
There's his conscience...
his memory...

603
01:39:51,094 --> 01:39:53,346
What has memory to do with it?

604
01:40:02,274 --> 01:40:04,193
Is he guilty of something?

605
01:40:04,612 --> 01:40:07,073
He thinks he is.

606
01:40:07,407 --> 01:40:08,951
Leave me alone!

607
01:40:17,086 --> 01:40:19,757
Leave me alone!

608
01:40:21,384 --> 01:40:24,721
I just wanted to be happy.

609
01:40:25,389 --> 01:40:29,394
What will happen to your
mother if you die?

610
01:40:35,735 --> 01:40:37,404
Everything will be

611
01:40:39,032 --> 01:40:40,492
all right...

612
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:44,079
Everything will be...

613
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,682
Do you want a boy or a girl?
