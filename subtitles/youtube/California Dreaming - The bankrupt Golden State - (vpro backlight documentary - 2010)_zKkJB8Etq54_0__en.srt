often has had an earthquake fires we

become a third world country we can be

46
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:27,180
eternally optimistic but if your

47
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:29,488
optimism is blinding you to necessarily

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,140
some of the problems that you face it

49
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,159
just it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a revolving door</font>

50
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,789
in a cycle that we can't get out of

51
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:38,829
la was a huge hotbed in regards to the

52
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,299
host of crime bars it's been a very

53
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,650
large amount of people that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,050
millions of people i would say that been

55
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,000
affected by this so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see there</font>

56
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,240
assistance and these fairs are something

58
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,950
that are going on a monthly basis within

59
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,990
the alley area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

60
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,939
tremendous need out there where do

61
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,950
people go after they are thrown out of

62
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,240
their house work many people go either

63
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,250
they move in with family or they just

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,360
try to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for somewhere to go rent so</font>

65
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,889
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you seen is that</font>

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
people have been moving in you have any

67
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,159
two or three families living in one unit

68
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,020
because a lot of people have either

69
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,150
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you haven't lost their home</font>

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,830
today they've lost their jobs so we're

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,599
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of kids coming back home to</font>

72
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the parents home we're seeing families</font>

73
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:38,530
combine because the situation is very

74
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:40,060
difficult right now I think Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> Park has</font>

75

76
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,360

77
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">there once we realize we could legally</font>

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,350
park there because for me like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

79
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,439

seventh largest economy in the world not

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,110
just the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> of America but just to</font>

95
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:46,240
say to California when I started working

stamps you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only buy food with it and</font>

121
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,470
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they give us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 600 a month for</font>

122
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,490
that so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit of</font>

123
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,650
food it's pretty much the only thing we

124
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,430
have is we have a lot of food but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

125
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:18,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">many places that cook it so this is the</font>

126
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,970
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> place that I found so far that we</font>

127
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:25,629
can cook actual food our refrigerator an

128
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:30,610
RV doesn't work our heater doesn't work

129
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:36,100

133
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:56,800
parking<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot yeah yeah yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice well</font>

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:30,069
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still gotta</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eat you're just tired</font>

136
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:32,319
after as soon as we started thinking

137
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buying an RV but the</font>

138
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">last of our money and everything we</font>

139
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,689
started looking for where we could park

140
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:40,870
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started noticing there's just a</font>

141
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,819
ton of rvs in this town<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're on</font>

142
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> street</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you go by at two in</font>

143
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,370
the morning they all have their

144
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:46,540
generators running clearly people are

145
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,889
living in them they're not like

146
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,439
therefore when people are on vacation

147
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,789
like you might think people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are living</font>

148
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,379
in them and I didn't realize how many

149
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,379
people until we started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

150
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:09,609
especially for families or people with

151
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:11,560
children<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are living out of their car</font>

152
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,970
and Santa Barbara has this great program

153
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,280
the safe parking program where they

154
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,750
provide people with a parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> space like</font>

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our car to drive two blocks</font>

367
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,319
like if this is locked everything

368
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,960
because we could have walked two blocks

369
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:56,649
but know that we're gonna take two cars

370
00:19:49,960 --> 00:20:02,769
to go a few hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> meters it's less</font>

371
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">than 100 meters that's just wrong way</font>

372
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,000
let's park here

373
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,700

375
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:34,960
how delicious it is smells really good

376
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:37,419
now that's talent hmm what we just did

377
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,538
pick public fruit from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> streets of</font>

378
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:42,549
Los Angeles in in in the neighborhood of

379
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:44,679
Silver Lake we all live in this

380
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:46,148
neighborhood and that's how we began we

381
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,249
just made a map of all the trees that

382
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,839
were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one what's so great about</font>

383
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,730
this particular neighborhood is that

384
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,028
these trees were planted a really long

385
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,759
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago by we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who but the</font>

386
00:20:55,028 --> 00:21:00,159
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's no law about the</font>

387
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,618
sidewalks about who owns a space this is

388
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,210
the city and behind the walls is the

389
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:06,428
people's property so in this area

390
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,769
there's no law that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't</font>

391
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:11,649
do this and so in the city of<font color="#CCCCCC"> La they</font>

392
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,509
say that it is not illegal to pick this

393
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:15,729
fruit people want locally produced and

394
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,858
nothing is more local than this right

395
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,378
combined with a terrible economic

396
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:22,269
situation so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it's going to</font>

397
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:31,480
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way people live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the cities</font>

607
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,220

608
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,410
day and age<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that things are</font>

609
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:51,559
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a state of constant flux</font>

610
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,929
and uncertainties so my own philosophy

611
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:56,420
with what's raising my own children<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

612
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:59,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know the most important</font>

613
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,550
capacity is to be adaptive and to know

614
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:04,489
how to learn but the fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

615
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,530
these economic crises the fact that you

616
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:08,839
know jobs are moving between countries

617
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,210
in a way that's completely unpredictable

618
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,039
that we really don't know what the

619
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,260
future holds in terms of the sort of

620
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,900
opportunities that are out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

621
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:21,160
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like the one certainty that we</font>

622
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,160
have for today's kids

623
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:42,180
I work at the University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of California</font>

624
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:48,419
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have felt the economic crisis for</font>

625
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:50,730
sure there's been huge budget cuts but

626
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that public university is</font>

627
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,889
going to be there is one of the finest

628
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:58,559
educational institutions that supplies

629
00:35:55,889 --> 00:36:01,019
education at low cost this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model is</font>

630
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,179
coming under challenge as the University

631
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:05,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of California is facing these budget</font>

632
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:08,009
shortfalls having to raise tuition and

633
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:42,780
increasingly relying on private money

634
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:45,180
for funding for my own kids I'm

635
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:49,590
extremely hopeful because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

636
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:52,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">for them they're really able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

637
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,300
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot of the opportunities</font>

638
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,630
that the new media environment has to

639
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,610
offer so much of this access to

640
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:04,079
knowledge is happening in very private

641
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:06,210
settings if you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> family that</font>

642
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,670
doesn't have a computer going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

643
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,190
school library for an hour every other

644
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,440
day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the same as having a</font>

645
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,990
smartphone always connected to the

646
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,460
internet being able to be on myspace and

647
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:20,069
facebook with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend all the time</font>

648
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,440
that gap is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge and the school</font>

649
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:25,940
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really a context that can mediate</font>

650
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,940
that disparity anymore

651
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:52,630
um these two computers are connected

652
00:37:45,070 --> 00:38:03,580
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to both at the same time</font>

653
00:37:52,630 --> 00:38:07,240
and my mouth can connect between for

654
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:13,420
your real<font color="#CCCCCC"> s or your virtual bit girl</font>

655
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:18,069
yeah what well cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can play with her</font>

656
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:23,320
however I want but these<font color="#CCCCCC"> big guy down</font>

657
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:29,680
there only yeah I can only do what the

658
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:32,349
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> program I think what we're</font>

659
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:35,289
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards is towards digital</font>

660
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:37,869
technology becoming a very sort of

661
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:39,400
pervasive part of everyday life so that

662
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,680
we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the</font>

663
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,019
distinction between the real and virtual

664
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,019
as something radically different

665
00:38:46,219 --> 00:39:00,618
I think the worst case scenario is that

666
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:03,500
these sort of technologies that will

667
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:05,539
accelerate the divide between the more

668
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,489
privileged and less privileged and I

669
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:10,699
think a city like la is a place where

670
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:13,009
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might see that happening so I think</font>

671
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:15,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the worst case scenario i think</font>

672
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,790
the best case scenario is that it will

673
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,210
actually help bridge them of those

674
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,210
divides

675
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:40,039
you

676
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:44,269
my name is Laura<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burkhalter I'm an</font>

677
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:46,608
architect and I've been thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

678
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:50,509
the urban paradigm my whole life because

679
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:53,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">I believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's another way my</font>

680
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:56,869
dream is that the city becomes a city

681
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,519
for people instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a city for cars</font>

682
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:04,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">and money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and power that the city is</font>

683
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,650
built by people for people I envision

684
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:09,890
infrastructure for people for example

685
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:12,740
bicycle freeways where you could cross

686
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:20,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">the city from one end to the other with</font>

687
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:23,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without a single traffic light I guess</font>

688
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:26,329
the crisis helped us<font color="#E5E5E5"> out we had a baby</font>

689
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:28,759
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were looking to move</font>

690
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,219
into an apartment to rent and it was so

691
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,740
expensive reason you can't afford it you

692
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:36,618
know we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking well maybe now</font>

693
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:39,439
it's the time to look at all the stuff

694
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that foreclosed on and bank owned and no</font>

695
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,970
one wants it so we were lucky to get

696
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:47,179
this place for less than half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font>

697
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:49,219
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been two years before can we</font>

698
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:54,259
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our friends with</font>

699
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:55,699
our community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grow food I think a</font>

700
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of people are starting to turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

701
00:40:55,699 --> 00:41:01,759
the idea of growing their own food too

702
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:03,619
because it's really probably better for

703
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,080
you obviously the things that you buy

704
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:09,230
from the supermarket that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are from out</font>

705
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,420
of the country or grown a lot of

706
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:14,389
pesticides or something thousands of

707
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">next really cost-effective oh yeah it's</font>

708
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:18,079
much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effective and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

709
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,510
that's why people are also getting

710
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,338
behind it right now because not you I

711
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,210
read something I forget it's like a

712
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:29,179
sixth time you use six-fold ear money

713
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">mmm right like let's say you buy tomato</font>

714
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:34,730
client for three dollars the amount of

715
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,440
tomatoes you get from it is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

716
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,380
six times<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than what it would cost</font>

717
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,240
you to buy the tomatoes right it is also

718
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,970
making people aware that they can do it

719
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,519
in their apart

720
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:46,618
it because know everyone is fortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

721
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,780
have like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing space like this and</font>

722
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:51,869
like I'd love to be able to learn how to

723
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,849
grow like little plants on my balcony or

724
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:55,289
you know something like that I would do

725
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:58,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we have the space on my</font>

726
00:41:55,289 --> 00:42:02,039
balcony and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely the case</font>

727
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,380
that produce is expensive now way more

728
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">than it used to be for right is being</font>

729
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,059
more conscious and doing it again yeah

730
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,800
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean well is it expensive it's</font>

731
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,980
the enough can afford to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to Whole</font>

732
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,769
Foods exactly this is what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying I</font>

733
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:19,858
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the crisis I think in</font>

734
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:22,259
anyone's mind whether you're an

735
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:25,170
entrepreneur or a person a citizen of

736
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:28,500
any nation status is how do you become

737
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,789
empowered and self-sufficient because we

738
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,090
have this crisis and people were

739
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:35,489
dependent upon a system and now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

740
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:38,700
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot of people are</font>

741
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:40,469
lost and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure what happened</font>

742
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:44,579
and what's going on I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

743
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:47,608
cure I guess or what I think is action

744
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:49,739
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you be self-sustainable how</font>

745
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:51,480
do you empower yourself I think the

746
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:53,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">system has made us believe that very</font>

747
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,329
powerless that were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the mercy of</font>

748
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,970
the system but we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

749
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:01,980
system can only exist with us buying

750
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:05,608
into the system and if we don't and we

751
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:09,740
start creating our own reality then the

752
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:09,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">system can no longer exists that way</font>

753
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,899
this is our workout for the day

754
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:43,179
what I think it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get anything</font>

755
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">done is first of all for people to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

756
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:47,589
bearing to imagine what would a cool

757
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,750
City be like what would it be like to

758
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,090
live in a really awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> City what would</font>

759
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:55,420
that look like and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> step two is to</font>

760
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:58,269
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking some action just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a door</font>

761
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:03,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">right here no that's too how friend this</font>

762
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:05,619
is a half bro let's maybe let's find out

763
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,239
what the door yeah that's good all right

764
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:11,530
here sister that looks rectangular right

765
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:14,919
I could take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this way kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> toss it</font>

766
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:17,290
i'll toss it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the sense of</font>

767
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,360
community is becoming much more

768
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:21,159
important than it used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be people</font>

769
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,710
depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each other they didn't used to</font>

770
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:26,170
depend at all everyone was like off to

771
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,480
themselves and looking for their own

772
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:32,260
interest and now people need each other

773

<font color="#E5E5E5">super long this one this one you like I</font>

782
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:04,599
grew up in a commune and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

783
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:07,150
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of each other and I think</font>

784
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,089
this one will take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the</font>

785
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:16,059
issues that I think happened in the more

786
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:19,630
typical commune setups so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

787
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:23,380
out if it's possible to have a you know

788
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:26,680
kind of a more modern version of how to

789
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:29,230
live in a city communally in the

790
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:32,319
seventies people they felt like everyone

791
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,579
has to follow one thing is I'm a

792
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,680
vegetarian you all have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

793
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:37,840
vegetarians if I don't drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car one</font>

794
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">has to not drive a car it was more</font>

795
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:44,490
ideological and now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's more</font>

796
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:44,490
practical in a way

797
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:52,799
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about farming I'm learning</font>

798
00:45:47,789 --> 00:46:06,449
learning as I go six beautiful and so

799
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:11,310
meditated kind of go on my zone I think

800
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gold rush is over yes people don't</font>

801
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:15,929
have the possibility to go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

802
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's no nothing of value that</font>

803
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:21,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like flip and make quick</font>

804
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:24,090
cash so that's the whole premise of gold

805
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:27,719
rush is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the American</font>

806
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:30,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">dream no I think the American Dream is</font>

807
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,189
bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think that's just one</font>

808
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:34,110
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> American dream that's been</font>

809
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,929
the expression of the American dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

810
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past you know couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decades but I</font>

811
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:40,500
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the whole American</font>

812
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:44,549
dream I think the American Dream has to

813
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:48,780
do with a self expression to freedom and

814
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:53,190
it's been caught up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this kind of want</font>

815
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:56,370
to have you know materialistic aspect of

816
00:46:53,190 --> 00:47:01,530
the American dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think Americans</font>

817
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:05,730
are very optimistic people and they they

818
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:10,860
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back up so I think the freedom</font>

819
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:12,300
is now being redefined and I think

820
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:16,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's still the American Dream is</font>

821
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,110
freedom but maybe its freedom from the

822
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,410
system maybe it's you know having your

823
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:25,050
own solar cells and your own power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

824
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:30,359
not having to pay into the system and

825
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:33,960
having ways to gather round that's not

826
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:37,870
part of the gasoline company's profit

827
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,500
it's another kind of freedom

828
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:43,719
one thing about Americans is that

829
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,519
they're very flexible I think it's going

830
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:48,759
to take longer for the rest of the world

831
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,380
to accept a new identity for America

832
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,800
than it is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Americans to</font>

833
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:57,820
accept the new identity because people

834
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,940
change their lives all the time here and

835
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:04,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's kind of the way it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is and oh</font>

836
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,599
this is over what's next<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know let's</font>

837
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,599
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

838
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,500
you
