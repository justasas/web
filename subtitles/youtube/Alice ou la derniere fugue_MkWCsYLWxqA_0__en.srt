1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,195
- Please call heads or tails...
- Tails.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,996
Alice!

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,228
Alice!

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,035
I'm exhausted.

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,117
You've no idea the day I've had.

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,035
Hell on earth.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,190
On top of it all they wanted me to lug
the Japanese to the Lido cabaret

8
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,076
It didn't take long,
I sent them on a walk.

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,031
Anyway, they shouldn't push it,
we're not animals.

10
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,189
Yep.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,196
But that other bastard...

12
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,076
you know, the one who's always
making my life hell.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,075
If I'm not careful, one of these
days, he's going to get me fired.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,198
He's a nutcase, a real pain in the ass.

15
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,077
For a bit of trickery,
you can always count on him.

16
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,075
He's the master.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,079
That's why, as soon as I knew
he'd be there to take the Japanese,

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,069
I backed out of it, said I'd sort
things for tonight, no problem.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,189
Then he got in a sulk.

20
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,195
I was loving it.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,031
- E
- Vowel

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,031
- E
- Consonant

23
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,037
The old man even smiled
as he was thanking me.

24
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,195
He apologized for putting it on me.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,189
Well, Alice, I swear...

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,076
I never do a thing!

27
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,993
So, I told him, it's no trouble.

28
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,197
I tell him, no bother at all, never is.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,076
And that I'm always free...

30
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,076
and that it's perfectly normal...

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,189
because I'm a company man!

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,076
I really pulled one over on those two.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,156
Bastards.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,076
Well, whatever...

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,156
I'm fetching them from the hotel at 10.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,195
And then we'll go and eat at the Lido.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,070
Oh, hey, I forgot-

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,075
they invited you, to this dinner...

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,036
No thanks.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,075
Have it your way.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,078
Oh, did you go to the doctor?
What did he say, was it nothing?

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,997
No, it's fine.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,195
I knew it.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,038
Women, always worrying about nothing.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,075
I'm going now, Bernard.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,195
Going where?

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,195
I'm leaving, far, far away from you.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,075
Are you mad?

49
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,155
What's going on?

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,229
Honey?

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,195
I'm going, now.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,188
Why?

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,036
I don't understand.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,195
Is there some guy?

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,036
Alice, come here.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,189
7, 9, 1, 75, 10, 100

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,074
ALI CE
or the Last Escapade

58
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,156
You're mad, don't do this, not tonight.

59
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,117
I can't stand you any more.

60
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,076
No, I won't let you go.

61
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,196
Please don't touch me.

62
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,196
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

63
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,076
I'm begging you, please be reasonable.

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,156
We can't wipe out 5 years like this,
we just can't.

65
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,198
We loved each other, Alice.

66
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,076
You haven't always been unhappy.

67
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,073
I can't stand you any more.

68
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,228
And where will you go?

69
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,228
I'm not telling you.

70
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,076
The weather's awful.

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,076
And I'm not letting you
leave in your state.

72
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,076
Forgive me?

73
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,076
For whatever I've done, I'm sorry.

74
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,192
Please, don't leave tonight,
you can't drive in this state.

75
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,076
You could leave tomorrow morning.

76
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,156
Rest tonight and leave tomorrow morning,

77
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,156
you'll be calmer and you'll
know what you're doing.

78
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,074
I can't stand you one second longer.

79
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,076
Listen Alice, if you want...

80
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,228
I'll sleep in a hotel.

81
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,198
Don't leave tonight,
I'm sure something will happen to you.

82
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,036
Something's already happened to me.

83
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,118
- I'm sorry, my car broke down...
- Come in, come in.

84
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,156
What's going on, Colas?

85
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,196
A young woman in a predicament, sir.

86
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,077
Please, come in, madam,
the weather's awful.

87
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,078
Your hair's all wet,
rivers running down your cheeks...

88
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,993
Come and get warmed up in here.

89
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,077
Colas, go and find something
to help get her dry.

90
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,075
Have a seat, relax, and
make yourself at home!

91
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,188
Thank you.

92
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,196
My name is Henri Vergennes.

93
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,030
You're a lifesaver!

94
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,076
It's my great pleasure.

95
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,188
Thank you.

96
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,196
My name is Alice Carol.

97
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,072
I'm really sorry to be
bothering you like this.

98
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,196
Oh, it's no bother at all.

99
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,076
Sit near the fire, you'll feel better.

100
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,076
There! The fire is our friend.

101
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,116
Would you like something to drink?

102
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,155
I'd love that... a whisky, please?

103
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,076
Oh. I don't have any whisky.

104
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,197
But I can offer you an excellent Port.

105
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,036
Ok, that's perfect.

106
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,993
I take it you haven't eaten yet.

107
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,155
Colas will whip something up for you.

108
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,198
- Really? That's not necessary.
- Oh, just an omelette or something.

109
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,076
It looks delicious!

110
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,196
Colas cooks it the traditional way.

111
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,076
Whites and yolks separate.

112
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,077
Absolutely. Why would two
different substances

113
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,190
require the same cooking time?

114
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,077
I can tell now, I was very hungry.

115
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,196
But I'll never eat all this.

116
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,196
No matter at all.

117
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,077
Maybe I should explain
why I'm out here tonight.

118
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,070
No need. You're a charming guest
and I'm having a wonderful evening.

119
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,119
Ah! The rain never stops!
And I don't think it will stop.

120
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,070
There's no way you can drive tonight,
especially with a damaged car.

121
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,032
I'd like you to accept my hospitality.

122
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,076
You look scared.

123
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,076
There's no need to worry, my dear.

124
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,157
The real dangers
are never those we imagine,

125
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,072
and never turn up
in the places we expect them.

126
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,076
You know that, don't you?

127
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,195
Colas will bring your luggage in, and
you'll get an excellent night's sleep.

128
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,157
Tomorrow the rain will have stopped,
your windscreen will be repaired...

129
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,192
and you'll be relaxed,
your spirit will be free to roam.

130
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,076
Don't you think?

131
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,156
I'm sorry I hesitated before.

132
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,036
Please...

133
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,078
You're exhausted, my dear child.
Go and get some rest.

134
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,076
Good night.

135
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,076
Thank you, with all my heart.

136
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,077
No, don't thank me,
I'm only doing my duty.

137
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,155
It's fine like that, don't you think?

138
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,076
I lit a small fire for you.

139
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,030
Thank you.

140
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,196
What a shame this pendulum's stopped.

141
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,156
It's broken, madam.

142
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,155
We don't care too much about time, here.

143
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,076
Have a good night, madam.

144
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,195
Is there anybody there?

145
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,077
Thank you very much. A.

146
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,075
This is impossible...

147
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,076
You must be exhausted.

148
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,076
There there, calm down.

149
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,076
Please, help me.

150
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,076
I don't think I'm able to.

151
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,236
Are you trying to leave?

152
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,190
I've walked the whole length
of this wall,

153
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,236
and I can't find the gate.

154
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,157
There's no gate.

155
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,236
But yesterday night when I came in...

156
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,076
Yesterday night, maybe.

157
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:12,076
This is absurd,
I need to get out of here!

158
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,113
No can do. You can get in here
but you can't get out.

159
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,076
Make of it what you will.

160
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,236
Where are Mr Vergennes and his butler?

161
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,030
I don't know.

162
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:31,077
Don't ask me any questions,
I can't answer them.

163
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,030
Who are you?

164
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,036
No questions.

165
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,076
But I want to get out of here.

166
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,076
Not possible. For the moment...

167
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,076
When will it be possible?

168
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,157
No questions.

169
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,115
I accept the game. This wall has
no openings, but it's not sky-high.

170
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,239
If I stand on my suitcase, I can
reach the top, and climb over.

171
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,076
That'll be a wasted effort.

172
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,076
Why wasted?

173
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,236
Help me.

174
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,155
No. I don't want to do you a bad turn.

175
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,158
Listen. I've decided to
get out of here.

176
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,157
If I need to get over
this wall, I'll do it.

177
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,190
So, be a gentleman, and help me.

178
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,076
No, you listen to me.

179
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,033
Don't try to use your
logical arguments in here.

180
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,036
They're worthless.

181
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,236
And no sentimental arguments either.

182
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,077
You'll soon see how misplaced they are.

183
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,114
I'm refusing to help you because
I don't want you to feel hopeless.

184
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,236
I don't need your concern.
Just help me, that's all.

185
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,155
As you wish, but it's a foolish idea.

186
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,076
Hey, don't touch me.

187
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,113
Don't try to touch me,
I'll hold the suitcase, that's all,

188
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,076
but don't try to touch me.

189
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,076
There, you see now?

190
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,156
There goes your last hope,
jump over the wall, simple isn't it?

191
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,076
Is that your problem solved?

192
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,236
There's no other side, Alice.

193
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,114
And you need to save your strength,
the nightmare hasn't begun yet.

194
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,157
How do you know my name?

195
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,155
No questions, I told you.

196
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,076
Come on, don't push it, come down.

197
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,236
No. I will get over the wall.

198
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,078
This is just a nightmare.
I'll get to the other side.

199
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,076
Don't try to get out.

200
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,033
Don't try to understand, not yet.

201
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:07,077
You'll have to live in the dark
for a while.

202
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,076
Make the most of it.

203
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,030
Accept it.

204
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,030
Don't think.

205
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,157
Trust us.

206
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,076
Trust yourself.

207
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,155
Live inside of what you're given.

208
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,236
You're very beautiful.

209
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,155
Where are you?

210
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,076
Too easy...

211
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:37,992
You're starting to feel at home, I see.

212
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,076
Who are you?

213
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,076
No questions.

214
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,076
You know the rules of the game now.

215
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,078
Questions are useless...
when there are no answers.

216
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,030
Fine.

217
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,072
I won't ask you who you are...

218
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,033
nor how to leave here,
nor what you want.

219
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:05,116
Wonderful.

220
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,031
However... I'd like you to
make the record play.

221
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,030
With pleasure.

222
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,076
We're sorry, it's an old record.

223
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,076
You're a very interesting case.

224
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:28,076
Brave, and flexible...

225
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,155
really quite flexible.

226
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,076
You accepted it.

227
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,078
You got into the swing of things.
Did what was necessary.

228
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:48,190
It's rare. And very good.

229
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,078
Most of those who found themselves in
your situation weren't so well-behaved.

230
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,032
They argued, screamed, yelled... begged.

231
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,076
They suffered, poor things.

232
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,076
And all for nothing, of course.

233
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,190
But for us... well, it was very amusing.

234
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,077
We played pranks on them.

235
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,155
See, just thinking about it
still makes me laugh.

236
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,192
You're made of much stronger stuff.
And that's great.

237
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,155
In fact, women tend to be
a lot hardier, I think...

238
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,078
But you, well out of all the women
you're quite remarkable.

239
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,030
Nothing to say?

240
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,190
It's just that I'd only have
questions to ask...

241
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,076
Remarkable, yes, you really are.

242
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,192
Ok, well I think everything should go
quickly, you won't stay here too long.

243
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,078
Careful though, don't think we won't
have a bit of fun at your expense.

244
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,076
But, you're not too badly off here.

245
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,076
You might even admit it yourself.

246
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,188
Don't go anywhere.
Read, listen to some music.

247
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,230
And wait. We'll make sure you
have everything you need.

248
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:28,195
Well, the essentials at least.

249
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,195
Don't be impatient.

250
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,036
You understand your situation, correct?

251
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,076
You won't do anything stupid?

252
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,197
I'm not answering any questions either.

253
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:48,076
I might have known...

254
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,030
What's your name?

255
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,077
I get it. You don't answer
questions either.

256
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,188
That's right.

257
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,077
It's not easy having a
conversation with no questions.

258
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,076
You get used to it.

259
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,077
You just have that impression
because you think...

260
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,190
I can tell you more
than you can tell me.

261
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,072
Anyway, grown-ups think
the only way to talk to children...

262
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,188
is by asking questions.

263
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,195
- You're not a child.
- Well spotted.

264
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:54,076
You don't speak like a child.

265
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,078
You're just being flattering because
you think boys of my age

266
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:00,076
like to feel like men.
That's not true.

267
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,076
Here, look.

268
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,076
Birds are stupid.

269
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:15,034
They don't realize the moment when the
door opens and they could get out.

270
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,078
If I understand rightly, you're the
reason the birds are singing today.

271
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,190
Yes. They thought you might like it.

272
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:28,076
I don't know them.

273
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,076
That's not entirely true.

274
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:34,155
And you know more than you think.

275
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,076
In any case, they know you.

276
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,076
I'll go and find some more if you want.

277
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,190
Of course. Where do you get them?

278
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,076
Hello, who's there?

279
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:38,076
My name is Alice Carol.

280
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh I see. I'm talking to myself.

281
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,076
Alice, look.

282
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,076
50 Francs' worth of Super, please.

283
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,076
Where can I wash my hands?

284
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:59,116
Shall I check your oil and water?

285
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,076
Yes.

286
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:41,195
What's your name?

287
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:46,195
Front left tire was a bit flat.

288
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,076
Rest's ok.

289
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,195
I topped up the water.

290
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,228
Thanks for that.

291
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:58,197
Hey, I saw I little girl. Is she yours?

292
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:02,076
It's not a girl, it's a boy.

293
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:04,076
Oh. He had a doll.

294
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:07,197
His slut of a mother managed to
pop out a boy who looks like a girl.

295
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,117
And when she realized,
you know what she did to me?

296
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:15,195
She took off, the bitch.

297
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,076
The world's a real shit-hole.

298
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,076
Don't talk like that.

299
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,076
Don't get me started.

300
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,076
Thanks.

301
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,155
- Are you going a long way like this?
- Why?

302
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:32,072
The steering's a bit funny,
y'know, be careful.

303
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:39,155
Have a good trip!

304
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,155
Hello, can I eat here?

305
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:15,076
Have a seat.

306
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:27,195
Are you having a banquet?

307
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:34,076
I'll have an omelette aux fines herbes.

308
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:39,148
Ok. And what would you like
to drink with that? Red wine?

309
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:42,076
No thanks, a black coffee please.

310
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:47,072
Wouldn't you rather have tea?

311
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,077
The coffee machine's broken.

312
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:53,197
I can only give you American-style.

313
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:57,076
Ok, tea then.

314
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,195
One omelette aux fines herbes!

315
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:09,078
- Hey honey, come back... champagne!
- No listen, s'not worth it I swear-

316
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:12,076
Leave me alone!

317
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,077
When we sing in cherry season

318
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:23,068
The gay nightingale and mockingbird
Will join the fun!

319
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:28,078
Fair lasses' heads
will fill with folly

320
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,077
And lovers' hearts with sun!

321
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,192
My sister died. We buried her this
morning. Do you want to dance?

322
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,076
Ok, maybe later.

323
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:16,155
What's that, tea?

324
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,189
Here, I've brought you a drink.

325
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,195
Well? Drink! Or don't, whatever.

326
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:48,076
- What's that?
- An omelette.

327
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:01,076
I can't breathe!

328
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,076
Piss off, Pepe!

329
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,076
Come in, come in.

330
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:42,076
My dear friend,
I'm so glad to see you again.

331
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,155
I hope you enjoyed your little walk.

332
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:50,076
I don't suppose you've eaten yet?

333
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:52,189
Come...

334
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:59,077
Let's get this sorted out.
Come and sit down.

335
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:07,078
While Colas is preparing dinner,
how about an aperitif?

336
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,195
I've got whisky!

337
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:24,030
You haven't said a word.

338
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:26,076
I've nothing to say.

339
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:32,076
Such wisdom.

340
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:37,032
I don't have any soda,
you must forgive me.

341
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:38,189
Oh absolutely.

342
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:46,077
Have you begun to understand yet?

343
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:49,189
I'm playing the same game
as you and your friends.

344
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:52,155
I'm not answering questions.

345
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,195
Would you like me to explain?

346
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:11,070
Bravo.

347
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,077
You have remarkable willpower.

348
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:18,072
Well, in any case, you need to know.

349
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,197
Where you are, why.

350
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:27,068
I hope you're not mad about
the little jokes we've played.

351
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,077
It's the only fun we ever have!

352
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:39,155
Right. Where to start?

353
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,077
You must understand that the
explanations I'm about to give you...

354
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:48,078
are not going to satisfy
your love for logic.

355
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:54,078
Because that logic doesn't comply...

356
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,197
with the laws you know of.

357
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:04,157
This house, this estate,

358
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:09,077
my own self and Colas are just...

359
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:14,077
representations drawn out for you.

360
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:18,155
Do you understand?

361
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,195
We're apparitions.

362
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:24,037
Apparitions, that can be changed...

363
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,115
according to your needs.

364
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:33,074
But we're not just apparitions,
we also have our own reality,

365
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:37,155
which is... transformable,
that's the word.

366
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:44,074
Now, how can I make you feel
this reality, to give you...

367
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:47,076
a clear idea?

368
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:53,192
Because ultimately, you realize,
it will soon be yours.

369
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:59,073
Let's say that this point is the spot...

370
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:02,192
where souls rise up from hell...

371
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:05,036
to take on human forms.

372
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:09,076
You understand?

373
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:12,189
Funny, isn't it?

374
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:16,076
Here, drink this.

375
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,078
That little wooden door over there,
which you found so intriguing...

376
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:28,192
even tried to open, well, it's
through that door that sometimes...

377
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:33,073
well, sorry to use
such an ugly expression...

378
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,197
but it's through that little door

379
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:43,073
that souls, all bloated with evil,

380
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:48,068
come back up from hell
to escape into your dear world.

381
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:55,229
Dinner is served.

382
01:17:55,239 --> 01:17:57,070
Thank you, Colas.

383
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,155
If you'd like to come with me
my dear friend,

384
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,157
we can continue this interesting
conversation during dinner. Ok?

385
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,155
But please, finish your drink.

386
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:18,076
Omelette aux fines herbes.

387
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:20,076
Isn't that what you wanted?

388
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,076
Please, take a bigger portion!

389
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,117
It's a real omelette.

390
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,195
I'm fine, thanks.

391
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:39,076
No thank you Colas, I'm not hungry.

392
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:47,076
Oh, don't look so worried.

393
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:49,155
I'm sure the omelette is excellent.

394
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:51,195
Colas!

395
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,077
Has that convinced you? Reassured you?

396
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,076
Right... I'll carry on where I left off.

397
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:16,189
As you've deduced,

398
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,197
it's impossible to escape fate.

399
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:26,032
For example, you certainly
can't get out of here.

400
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,037
You believe it now, surely?

401
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:34,157
Answer me, please.
You believe it don't you?

402
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:39,189
Yes.

403
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:42,076
Well you're wrong!

404
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:46,077
You'll soon be able to get back to...

405
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:49,192
your reality, your civilization...

406
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,076
that you seem to be so attached to.

407
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:59,076
Well, isn't that good news?

408
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,077
It's excellent news.

409
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,158
That little door. It's the alpha
and the omega of your adventure.

410
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:15,077
I haven't told you
the full story about it yet.

411
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:20,068
If it allows creatures from down below
to escape into the world,

412
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:24,157
it allows you, and all those
in your situation,

413
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:28,158
to find out all the things
they're attached to.

414
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,072
You just have to go down.

415
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,030
Into hell, right?

416
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:37,115
Yes, hell! Don't be frightened of it!

417
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:42,078
You've no other option,
so let's not get scared about it.

418
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:48,068
Er, down there, from time to time...
hopefully not too long...

419
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:55,036
you'll experience certain moral,
physical transformations...

420
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:56,229
call it what you will.

421
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:02,078
And after, you can get out
of here, my dear Alice.

422
01:21:08,119 --> 01:21:10,076
Do you like Mozart?

423
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:16,073
My dear Alice, tomorrow morning
you'll be woken by a ray of sunlight.

424
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,032
The little wooden door will open up,

425
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:25,077
and it will be the end of this torment.

426
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:34,198
Now that you know everything,
take my advice:

427
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:39,077
Go and get some rest, try to sleep.

428
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:47,076
Goodbye, my dear child.

429
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,195
Why are you laughing?

430
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,195
I'm going to answer that.

431
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:30,993
When you tried to get over the wall,
you could have made it.

432
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:36,078
You should have trusted your instinct,
followed through with your decision.

433
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:41,072
I can always start over, you know.

434
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:46,077
Nope. Now there's no more wall.

435
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,155
Goodnight Alicccce.

436
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:55,076
Goodnight Colassss.

437
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:52,076
We thought you'd be asleep.

438
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:53,189
You need to sleep.

439
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:58,076
We'll take care of it.

440
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:13,189
Don't move or fight. It's useless.

441
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:17,076
Be quiet, be still.

442
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:20,189
You won't feel a thing,
and you'll sleep.

443
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:33,076
There's a good girl.

444
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:59,077
