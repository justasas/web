1
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,163
Who are you?

2
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:40,882
Jesus.

3
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,269
You ok?

4
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,441
Do I look ok?

5
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:59,901
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist

6
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,783
No...

7
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:18,170
Trevor...

8
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,007
You still got half an hour.

9
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,885
I can fix you some eggs.

10
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:29,639
I am tired but thanks.

11
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,317
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

12
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,906
Come on guys, keep it moving.

13
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:31,326
Yes sir, yes sir,
Master Tucker, motherfucker

14
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,540
Hey, why is that machine down!

15
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,503
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill

16
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,797
Where am I going to make up
that 7 minutes? Miller?

17
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,382
Your paycheck?

18
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:49,803
-Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations.
-What regulations?

19
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:55,517
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning
and maintenance of all heavy machineries, (motion 1989)

20
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:02,608
Ya! Write to your congressman and hurry that up.

21
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:13,286
Congratulations, Reznik.
You just made my shitlist.

22
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,336
And he's like, you know, babe this babe that...
Chatting like mother fucking Barry White.

23
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,757
Talking about what he is going to do to her,
and how to make her Cucci feel and all that.

24
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,216
That is right.

25
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,426
So then, she stopped

26
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:33,472
She looked back at him with these
big puppy eyes she's like...

27
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:38,019
That sounds good puppy,
but me no have no Cucci

28
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,274
So, my man said, what?!
He looked down and realised that SHE IS A HE!

29
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,776
Man, that's bullshit!

30
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:50,531
You meant to tell me that this whore was wearing nothing
but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference.

31
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:54,034
Hey, man. he had one of those "tuck jobs".
Come on Jones, you know how to do that.

32
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:56,161
You might, I don't!

33
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:57,454
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,956
You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?

35
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,167
Can't, got plans.

36
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,422
Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night.
Hey, what is up with you?  you used to be alright.

37
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,050
Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright.

38
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,596
Hey, Jackson, you need to realise that
some men prefer the company of women.

39
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:17,974
Who!  hotty duty, he ain't get no booty.

40
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,019
Maybe he has got a date by the name "tuck jobs"

41
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:25,815
No, your mother said she couldn't make it.

42
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:30,612
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

43
00:08:51,674 --> 00:08:52,509
You ok?

44
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:56,471
Do I look ok?

45
00:08:57,764 --> 00:09:00,183
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

46
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:03,645
What's wrong?

47
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,566
I don't know, deja vu.

48
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,320
You are tired, you need to sleep.

49
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,835
How do you do it?

50
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:26,627
What?

51
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,504
Sleep so little and still look so good.

52
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,507
Are you flirting with me?

53
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,466
Commiserating

54
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,098
-Try to fatten me up?
-What if I am?

55
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,059
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

56
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,227
You had that last night.

57
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:47,730
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

58
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,359
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm

59
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,987
What else do you know about me?

60
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:57,074
That you are lonely.

61
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:03,664
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

62
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:10,212
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:15,717
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

64
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:16,468
Check please

65
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:40,444
You, Reznik, Furman's office. Now!

66
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,910
How are you doing, Reznik?

67
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:48,995
What is this about?

68
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,498
Frankly I am concerned about you.

69
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,086
To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit.

70
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,717
I felt a lot on my mind lately.

71
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:06,304
-Anything we can help with?
-No, thanks. There's nothing I can't handle.

72
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:09,557
- Wanna see a doctor?
- It is not necessary, I am fine really.

73
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,475
Are you doing drugs Reznik?

74
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:17,815
Where is Stewart?

75
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:19,484
He couldn't make it

76
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,153
- Shouldn't even be in here with an union ()
- See what I mean.

77
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,366
Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, but believe me,
there is absolutely nothing to worry about

78
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,160
Then I will just get back to work

79
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,621
Er... Trevor, not yet.

80
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,917
I need to ask you for a UA

81
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:52,827
Look like rain.

82
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,882
Radio says there is a storm on the way.

83
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:13,097
they said right.

84
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:14,890
I'd say it's already here.

85
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,230
You are on the first shift?

86
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:25,192
- Yeah
- Me too

87
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,240
Funny I never seen you before.

88
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,534
I've been here.

89
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:37,538
I work in the pit
I just picked up Reynolds's shift.

90
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,749
Where is Reynolds?

91
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,588
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.

92
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:53,512
I am Ivan.

93
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:00,603
Trevor

94
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:09,738
Well, I guess I'd better begin by...

95
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:12,657
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.

96
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:14,491
You got that right.

97
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,412
I will see you around.

98
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:47,233
what is wrong?

99
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,403
I just want to lie here.

100
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:52,697
We can do that.

101
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:57,994
I'm... so... tired

102
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:02,499
You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter.

103
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,086
That is the problem. I can't sleep.

104
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:08,421
Nothing helps.

105
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:12,925
Don't worry about it honey.

106
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,595
Everyone get insomnia every now and then.

107
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,847
Stevie

108
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:25,312
I haven't slept in a year.

109
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:35,824
Jesus Christ!

110
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:38,367
I tried him too...

111
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:45,541
I am sorry.

112
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:50,879
Hello?

113
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:58,096
Yeah. No I can't.
I can't talk now. Okay.

114
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:06,813
My ex, he's a fucking Psycho.

115
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,152
Trevor, I am worried about you.

116
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:17,448
Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia.

117
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:23,579
I hope not, you are my best client.
Can't afford to lose ya.

118
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:26,707
Geee... thanks

119
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:32,087
Reznik, I need a hand

120
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,932
Gotta get this dead level here, help me out

121
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,104
- Safety on?
- Oh Yeah

122
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,527
How is that?

123
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:56,862
A little to the left.

124
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,708
Do I need more?

125
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:14,547
Hey, you sleep on your own time, need some help here.

126
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,717
Better, now try the other side.

127
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:20,761
I hate this bitch.

128
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,495
Hey! what did you do?

129
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,333
I am hooked up here.
Kill it, will ya?

130
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:55,046
-Come on, kill it.
-Not working.

131
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,963
Damn it! Reznik!
Shit!

132
00:19:57,882 --> 00:19:58,799
- Kill it!
- Not working

133
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,805
God! Jesus!

134
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,348
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

135
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,141
Hit the breaker!

136
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:18,861
Hey, hey, hey!
We some help over here!

137
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:20,904
We need some help

138
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,952
- Come on man, come on.
- What's happening here, man?

139
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,080
Call an ambulance!

140
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,708
What happened here?

141
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,086
I was helping him with the belt.
I thought the safety was on.

142
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:36,128
You thought?!

143
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,425
Somebody kill that fucking machine!

144
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:51,203
Shit!

145
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:23,985
Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I come to give you the rent.

146
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:29,784
And so early. Oh Mr Reznik, I only wish
all my tenants are considerate as you.

147
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,576
I will give you a receipt in the morning

148
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:34,162
Good night mr. Reznik.

149
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:37,249
Err... Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me

150
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:41,336
but... if you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

151
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,258
- Has there been a burglary?
- No, no, no, I just wondered if...

152
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:51,681
You know errr... if you noticed anything unusual lately?

153
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:53,432
Unusual?

154
00:22:55,518 --> 00:22:57,937
Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

155
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:02,692
I am sorry... to disturb you so late.
Good night.

156
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,283
What we know is this:

157
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:16,997
One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.

158
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:22,836
Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone
of mill while it was off.

159
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:26,048
Three: the mill suddenly activates,

160
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:30,344
catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this.

161
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,440
What is the fucking point?

162
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,608
These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

163
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:49,195
Our job is to investigate these events
from every possible angles...

164
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,824
So that we might prevent their reoccurrence.

165
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:57,078
So we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co-operative.

166
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,541
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.

167
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:03,918
What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?

168
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,379
I was distracted.

169
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,884
By what?
What distracted you?

170
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:20,519
It was Ivan,
I was watching Ivan on the pit.

171
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,272
The whole thing is my fault, okay.

172
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:25,773
Who did you say?

173
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:28,903
The new arcwelder,
I don't know his last name.

174
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,405
- What new arcwelder?
- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift.

175
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,910
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
This guy got his place.

176
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,077
What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?

177
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:41,623
Reynolds is right over there
on the pit as usual, busting his ass.

178
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:46,586
There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik.

179
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,023
What is this?

180
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:11,319
Mr. Reznik
Have you recently suffered any head injuries?

181
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:21,639
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

182
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,057
No

183
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:25,894
-Trevor
-Yeah

184
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,312
Can I ask you a question?
Sure

185
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,401
Why do you go all of your way
to come here every night?

186
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,486
Is it all the way?

187
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:38,073
An airport? For coffee and pie?

188
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:40,909
Suppose I went to Danni's...

189
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,455
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.

190
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:47,206
Could I do that just in any diner?

191
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,586
Is someone chasing you?

192
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:55,132
Not yet. But they will
when they find out who I am.

193
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:58,468
Oh really!  Who are you?

194
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:00,846
Can you keep a secret?

195
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,766
To the grave.

196
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:05,683
I am Elvis Presley.

197
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,189
I ran away from home
to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.

198
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,816
I thought you looked familiar.

199
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:23,660
Got plans for mother's day?

200
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:26,747
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.

201
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:30,250
Suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun.

202
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,668
That is ok, when he is older

203
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,588
I will let him make it up to me.

204
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:37,216
A little guilt goes a long way.

205
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,674
How about you?

206
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:40,426
Cemetery

207
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,681
- Oh, I am sorry
- Thanks

208
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,101
I lost mine too. Still hurts.

209
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,940
I am not so good at losing family.

210
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:53,941
Who is?

211
00:27:56,777 --> 00:28:00,822
What's weird is that it did not hit
until I picked out her burial dress.

212
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:04,451
I pictured her while buying it...

213
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:08,413
...Not knowing it would...

214
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:10,414
You know, be the one.

215
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:14,919
Seems unfair, isn't it?

216
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:17,965
Not knowing things like that

217
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:26,306
Hey, how about spending the day
with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?

218
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:36,400
Sounds dreamy

219
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:11,308
Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?

220
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:13,644
Armed robbery.

221
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:17,523
Oh yeah, that is right, because I and Jackson
had you packed and pantified... ain't that right, Jackson?

222
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,778
HEY, I don't see what is so fucking funny.

223
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,074
You clowns think this's fucking like some big joke
but it ain't!

224
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:33,039
Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you.

225
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:35,333
You made me nervous.

226
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:40,547
You look like shit, acting all crazy.
What is up with you?

227
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:42,298
Nothing is up with me.

228
00:29:42,923 --> 00:29:46,052
It was an accident and I am the one
who gotta live with it, not you.

229
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:51,682
You ain't hearing me, man.

230
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:56,645
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.

231
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,667
See you tomorrow.

232
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:35,851
Hey

233
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:11,096
Howdy, partner.

234
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,265
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

235
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,394
- What about?
- I don't know, but it seemed important.

236
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,772
What! He's ganna have to wait,
it is Miller time.

237
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:26,653
We need to talk.

238
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,447
Follow me.

239
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,376
Come on!

240
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:56,266
Another Bourbon.

241
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:02,938
Make it double.

242
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,117
You shooting coke or something?

243
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:20,749
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.

244
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:24,376
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.

245
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:26,003
How about abnormally?

246
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:31,634
I see Reynolds is back to work.

247
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:35,388
Gets to me bail

248
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,768
I will tell you one thing,
If I dig, You are showing carbon to it.

249
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:44,397
Would you? never trust a con, cowboy!

250
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,231
They ain't get to live to be honest.

251
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:50,194
Where they hiding you these days?

252
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,030
Around

253
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:00,246
Hey, you wanna see something?

254
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:08,671
Look at that. Lost them on a lake.

255
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:14,094
They took a big toe from the left foot
and a finger from my right.

256
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:16,679
That is why I walk with a gimp.

257
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:22,935
Yeah, I can't shuffle my cock like I used to
but the ladies sure like it.

258
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:30,026
Oh, no. You look like you have seen a ghost.

259
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:36,073
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.

260
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,496
- That is why I can't get a raise.
- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll.

261
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,248
You believe that?

262
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,751
- Why would they lie?
- They just have a little bit of fun with you.

263
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,212
I am not laughing.

264
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,178
Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm.
He could have died.

265
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:01,890
That ain't my problem.

266
00:34:03,393 --> 00:34:08,606
You caused the accident, not me.

267
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:15,738
Where are you going?

268
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:21,827
Take a leak, you wanna watch?

269
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:26,833
I will be right back, don't just bail me now.

270
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:11,794
- Hello?
- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor.

271
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:14,755
What time is it?

272
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:18,175
How are they biting Reynolds?

273
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:27,768
- You, you are drunk, Reznik.
- The game's over. I got proof on you.

274
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:30,730
I could use it.

275
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:35,734
You better watch your fucking ass buddy,
before you lose it.

276
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:37,588
Trevor?

277
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:40,048
I need to see you, Stevie.

278
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,889
- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here.
- Please, Stevie.

279
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:50,809
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?

280
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,980
No, no, no, no, I need to see you now.

281
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:58,067
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

282
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,364
Ok, give me a minute.

283
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:09,912
I appreciate you making time for me,
you are the only one I can talk to.

284
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:13,958
My pleasure.

285
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:18,795
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.

286
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:25,928
Something is happening to me, Stevie.

287
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:30,349
Some kind of... plot.

288
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:37,440
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.

289
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,775
- Oh, my god!
- Now the guys at work are against me.

290
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,114
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...

291
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,410
Their eyes, their little games.

292
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:55,583
What?

293
00:37:57,293 --> 00:38:00,671
E R.. E R..

294
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:05,425
-T U C K E R
-Trevor?

295
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:07,385
TUCKER?

296
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:13,099
Maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard.

297
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:14,143
I mean...

298
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:21,484
If they wanted you out,
they could just fire you.

299
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:24,152
I am not worried about being fired.

300
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:26,989
Then what are you worried about?

301
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:31,409
I don't know yet.

302
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,924
There you go, made to order.

303
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:48,677
- Thanks.
- Surprise!

304
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,723
Got ya! That one's going on the fridge.

305
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:56,309
Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas.

306
00:38:58,603 --> 00:38:59,687
By the carousel.

307
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,650
Just a minute.

308
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,405
Okay, ready.

309
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:10,824
Smile!

310
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,168
It helps if you push the button.

311
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:28,717
Trevor? What is it?

312
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:41,020
- This place, brings back memories.
- Good memories I hope.

313
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:44,400
Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid.

314
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:52,198
My ex, probably phone
to ruin a happy Mother's Day

315
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,785
Could you...?

316
00:39:55,994 --> 00:40:00,081
- Yes, no sweat. I will take Nicolas for a ride.
- Thanks.

317
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,673
How long have you known my mother?

318
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:10,800
About a year.

319
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:14,763
How did you meet her?

320
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:16,849
We just kind of met.

321
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,894
Are you going to see her again?

322
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:22,271
I hope so.

323
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:25,148
Would you like that?

324
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:26,317
I guess so

325
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:32,155
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

326
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:33,615
What?

327
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:38,578
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?

328
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:41,582
Made me realised what a wonderful mother I had.

329
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,376
You will realise that too some day.

330
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:46,711
What is that?

331
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:48,923
Monster ride.

332
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,927
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What does that mean?

333
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:57,972
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

334
00:40:58,306 --> 00:40:59,432
Can we go in?

335
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:03,436
Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother.

336
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,646
What for?

337
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:08,817
You are going straight
to hell on route 666.

338
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:16,867
Ride here if you dare!
You are going straight to hell on route 666.

339
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:22,581
Look like someone had a bad crack up.

340
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,418
Fill her up, cowboy.

341
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,262
We wouldn't be eating in there
anytime soon, Nicolas?

342
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:54,613
Eww.. look at that.

343
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:00,952
You should close your eyes.

344
00:42:13,172 --> 00:42:14,006
Jesus!

345
00:42:20,347 --> 00:42:23,559
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

346
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:29,565
Shady Lady

347
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:34,777
Oh, my God.

348
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:37,364
Stop!

349
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:38,490
Woo

350
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:58,176
Take a right, Nicolas!
Right, a right!

351
00:43:27,414 --> 00:43:32,586
Nicolas, Nicolas!
Hey, Nicolas!

352
00:43:47,516 --> 00:43:49,018
I need some help here.

353
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:52,981
Okay, somebody gets a doctor.

354
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,483
Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help.

355
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,567
Nicolas!

356
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,119
I swear to God, I don't know what happened.

357
00:44:07,663 --> 00:44:09,498
He is epileptic.
I should have told you.

358
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,918
- I will call an ambulance.
- No, thanks.

359
00:44:15,545 --> 00:44:16,713
It is ok, baby.

360
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:34,230
It hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.

361
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:37,192
I could have killed myself
for taking him on that ride.

362
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:39,027
It's ok, it's not your fault.

363
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:44,240
He won't even remember it,
as if nothing ever happened.

364
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,668
Wanna come in?

365
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,253
I think you could use a drink.

366
00:45:43,382 --> 00:45:45,009
I hope wine is okay with you.

367
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:48,804
That'll work.

368
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:56,646
What good is it at home
if you can't relax in it.

369
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,231
I will have to remember that.

370
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:13,163
Trevor? Can I ask you something?

371
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,500
Should my lawyer be present?

372
00:46:20,795 --> 00:46:24,007
Why are you always leaving such generous tips?

373
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,551
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?

374
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:29,471
And entertainment.

375
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,724
- Entertainment?
- You.

376
00:46:34,976 --> 00:46:38,396
Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship.

377
00:46:39,773 --> 00:46:42,943
Sorry, I wasn't meant that way.

378
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:49,239
If you really wanna spoil me,
take me to a movie sometime.

379
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,659
Hmmm?

380
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:53,536
That is a deal.

381
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,378
My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass.

382
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:05,715
I will get it.

383
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,135
-You wait on me.
-Thanks

384
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,184
It is the last door on the left.

385
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:52,858
Reznik

386
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,071
I want you on the Swansea-leave today.

387
00:50:59,114 --> 00:51:03,785
- Where is Sanchez?
- That is an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you.

388
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:20,260
Shit!

389
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:40,364
- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you, Mr Furman.

390
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,701
Bye. See you now.

391
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:47,496
Hey, look who it is.
Bombay Miller, you ok?

392
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:50,458
- Good, good.
- You be easy now.

393
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,709
Yeah, man, take it easy.

394
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:57,173
My God, Miller.
I don't know where to begin.

395
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:01,259
Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
There is nothing to say.

396
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:04,180
I wish there is someway I can repay you.

397
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,644
Well, for a start, you can give me your left arm.

398
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:13,688
In fact, that is why I came
by here today. Isn't it, Tucker?

399
00:52:13,773 --> 00:52:14,981
Fair is fair

400
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,277
We are just razzing you, kid

401
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:22,647
You keep your left arm,
I will keep my settlement.

402
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:26,902
Hell! How can a guy lost an arm
end up like getting a deal like this?

403
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:28,528
So, I guess you can call me lucky.

404
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:32,449
Well, Miller,
if there is anything I can do...

405
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:38,371
Nah, forget it.
No hard feelings, huh.

406
00:52:40,248 --> 00:52:41,541
I will see you around, pal.

407
00:53:18,204 --> 00:53:18,746
Ah!

408
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:20,580
Hey!

409
00:53:21,623 --> 00:53:22,790
Help!

410
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:29,881
Hey!

411
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,299
Hey!

412
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:36,347
Someone help me!
Someone help me!

413
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:51,903
Reznik

414
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:52,987
Ah...

415
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:53,989
I got ya, I got ya.

416
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:56,032
Be cool, be cool, alright?

417
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:03,414
Who did it, huh?

418
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,501
Why did you turn the fucking braker!

419
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,628
Was it all of you?

420
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,922
Was it you, Jones?

421
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:11,839
Was it you? Was it you?

422
00:54:12,007 --> 00:54:13,133
Or was it you?

423
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,177
You sick bastard,
you're imagining things again!

424
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:18,389
Oh yeah? You've been fishing
with Ivan lately, Reynolds?

425
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:23,643
How's that... How's that tuna biting?
Let's see how you talk yourself out of this one!

426
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:33,570
Where is it?

427
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:35,822
Right, what the fuck now, Reznik!

428
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:40,577
Get him off me!

429
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,373
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.

430
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,750
You are fired.

431
00:54:56,175 --> 00:54:57,302
This motherfucker's crazy.

432
00:54:57,885 --> 00:54:59,221
You lost it, man.

433
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:21,285
Shit!

434
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:31,545
Damn it! Where is it?

435
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:41,805
Asshole!

436
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:45,224
What the fuck did you do with it?

437
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:48,854
Idiot!

438
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:19,318
Hey! Fuck you!

439
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:21,822
Get out!

440
00:57:38,547 --> 00:57:39,505
What?

441
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:44,219
It's an occupational hazard.

442
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:08,242
So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from
this miserable life or what?

443
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,668
I could give it up for the right guy.

444
00:58:24,092 --> 00:58:26,052
Oh, that came out wrong.

445
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:30,682
What I mean is...

446
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:38,606
I would, you know,
stop hooking if you wanted me to.

447
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,445
I mean, there are lots of
pancakes out there, right?

448
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,579
I think I'd like that.

449
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:17,414
Mr. Reznik.

450
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:20,083
I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else.

451
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,751
You leave me in such a scare.

452
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,632
What are you doing in my apartment?

453
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,259
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

454
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,970
That's impossible.

455
01:00:32,304 --> 01:00:33,847
I'm gonna leave a note.

456
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:36,307
A note? What kind of note?

457
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,268
About the leak.

458
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:41,521
What's that terrible smell?

459
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:43,565
There is no leak in this apartment.

460
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:45,858
Now if you would excuse me...

461
01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:46,525
You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?

462
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:50,487
Yeah, I'm sure. If you need anything,
please call first.

463
01:02:16,949 --> 01:02:17,991
Miller!

464
01:02:19,494 --> 01:02:20,620
Hey, Reznik.

465
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:23,206
It's a pleasant surprise.

466
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:25,291
We need to talk.

467
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,501
Take a look at this, huh?

468
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:29,586
Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line.

469
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:33,298
Let's not trim anyting for a while.

470
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:34,342
I need to be doing something.

471
01:02:34,342 --> 01:02:36,427
Can't just watch the soap opera all day.

472
01:02:36,427 --> 01:02:41,140
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't. Listen to the doctor.

473
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:45,228
Margie, this is Reznik.
The man who cost me my arm.

474
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,692
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

475
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:53,902
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

476
01:02:58,865 --> 01:03:00,742
Is there some place we can talk?

477
01:03:03,036 --> 01:03:08,292
Check it out.
It's a beauty.

478
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:11,421
8 cylinders

479
01:03:13,797 --> 01:03:15,674
Speed sensitive steering

480
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:19,304
ABS breaking with road texure and tension

481
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:24,392
Defence lock-up helps you
maintain control in emergencies.

482
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:25,976
Of course, it's automatic.

483
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:27,227
Hell I wanted a stick...

484
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:30,648
but I figured my shifting ability
wouldn't be so hot.

485
01:03:33,568 --> 01:03:35,361
You know I am not at
National any more, right?

486
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:36,863
Yeah, I heard about it.

487
01:03:37,155 --> 01:03:39,073
It sounds like you almost
lost one yourself, huh?

488
01:03:40,782 --> 01:03:42,451
Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?

489
01:03:42,909 --> 01:03:43,952
Ironic?

490
01:03:44,996 --> 01:03:47,123
I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade.

491
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:49,750
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

492
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,586
Moments after you left the shop,

493
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:54,547
someone powered up my machine.

494
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,507
With my arm in it.

495
01:03:57,175 --> 01:03:58,384
I nearly got killed.

496
01:03:58,717 --> 01:03:59,760
Accidents happen.

497
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,802
It wasn't an accident.

498
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:04,682
Accidents happen out of negligence

499
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:07,684
This happened down the spike.

500
01:04:07,684 --> 01:04:09,353
That's some vocabulary you got kid.

501
01:04:09,353 --> 01:04:10,270
Spike.

502
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:14,232
It wields vengeance,
vengeance means revenge Miller.

503
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:16,027
I am sure you know
what revenge means, don't you?

504
01:04:16,027 --> 01:04:17,362
I am onto you Miller.

505
01:04:17,362 --> 01:04:20,740
Despite your stupid jokes,
you secretly balme me for the accident.

506
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:23,408
New car, huh? You despise me for it.

507
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:24,827
How did you get into my place?

508
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,454
Duplicate keys? credit card? What?

509
01:04:26,454 --> 01:04:28,414
Fuck you, Miller!

510
01:04:28,414 --> 01:04:29,665
This shit is gonna stop!

511
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,842
Get off my property, punk!

512
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:03,990
Bastards.

513
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:19,673
Shit.

514
01:05:34,981 --> 01:05:35,815
Come on.

515
01:06:15,396 --> 01:06:16,897
7-4...

516
01:06:16,896 --> 01:06:18,523
...3-C-R

517
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:20,108
It's 743CR.

518
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:30,036
What?

519
01:06:33,873 --> 01:06:34,664
Shit.

520
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,760
Fuck!

521
01:06:49,429 --> 01:06:50,764
I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide...

522
01:06:50,764 --> 01:06:53,516
...motor's information to the general public.

523
01:06:53,516 --> 01:06:54,851
I'm not just a memeber of the general public.

524
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:56,603
This guy is a friend of mine.

525
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,731
But you don't know your firend's address?

526
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:01,650
We just met, I don't know him that well.

527
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,446
Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service.

528
01:07:05,445 --> 01:07:07,322
I just want talk to him.

529
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:11,284
I'm sorry sir, I can't help you
unless a crime has been committed.

530
01:07:11,284 --> 01:07:12,327
Has a crime been committed?

531
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:17,916
Please, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremly important.

532
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:19,960
Sorry sir. No crime, no information.

533
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,762
What if I told you I was hit by this car?

534
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:33,224
I don't see any bruises.

535
01:07:33,224 --> 01:07:35,101
If you did,
would you give me an address?

536
01:07:36,268 --> 01:07:37,894
No, but the police might.

537
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,376
I want to report a hit and run.

538
01:09:34,677 --> 01:09:38,390
Bring it back when you are finished.
Fill it out over there.

539
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:20,056
Mr. Reznik.

540
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:24,228
You sure about these plate numbers?

541
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:28,064
743CR. All right, that's the one.

542
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:30,274
Do you ever have a car stolen?

543
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:32,443
No, what?

544
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:35,572
Cause the car that
allegedly hit you was your own.

545
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:41,828
1969, red pontiac viper
registered to your name.

546
01:10:42,328 --> 01:10:44,747
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totally wrecked.

547
01:10:56,009 --> 01:10:58,386
Do you know it is a felony
to file a bogus police report?

548
01:11:00,596 --> 01:11:03,099
Hey, wait a minute.
You got some explaining to do.

549
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,059
Hey! Hey!

550
01:12:33,814 --> 01:12:36,025
Jesus, Reznik. Just wanna talk to you.

551
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:42,157
Hey come back. Reznik, Reznik!

552
01:14:10,287 --> 01:14:10,996
Trevor?

553
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:14,957
Oh, no.

554
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:23,841
Trevor, what do you want?

555
01:14:26,302 --> 01:14:28,846
Trevor, it's okay.

556
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:35,395
Oh God, what happend?

557
01:14:36,854 --> 01:14:40,942
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.

558
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:44,820
Did he stop?

559
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:49,367
No, he just kept going.

560
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:52,578
He fucking hit my drivers man.

561
01:14:53,246 --> 01:14:55,123
He gotta be hanged.

562
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:57,917
It was my fault.

563
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:00,252
I wasn't paying attention.

564
01:15:00,837 --> 01:15:03,006
Trevor, we got get you to a hospital.

565
01:15:04,506 --> 01:15:05,925
You may have some internal injuries.

566
01:15:05,926 --> 01:15:07,636
it is just bruises.

567
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:09,512
Okay, you see this?

568
01:15:10,095 --> 01:15:13,474
This is a bruise,
and this is a train wreck, alright?

569
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,561
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?

570
01:15:20,481 --> 01:15:21,690
I trust you.

571
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:25,319
Now I know.
You are crazy.

572
01:15:27,029 --> 01:15:28,447
Can I stay here tonight?

573
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,493
Babe, you can stay here every night.

574
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,119
You know that?

575
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:37,414
What?

576
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:41,585
What,Babe,
what's going on in that crazy head of yours?

577
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,172
I really want this to work, Stevie

578
01:15:49,051 --> 01:15:49,844
But?

579
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:54,139
You know so little about me.

580
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,311
What if I turned into a warewolf or something?

581
01:16:02,356 --> 01:16:04,442
I will buy you a flea collar.

582
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:11,657
I love you.

583
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,833
Stevie

584
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:21,751
Yeah.

585
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,293
Thanks.

586
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,688
I set out some clean cloth for you,
your stuff is not dry yet.

587
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:45,315
You always keep men's cloth lying around?

588
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:50,238
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep their clean change cloth here.

589
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:53,032
I probably just throw
them out now, alright?

590
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:55,452
Hey, perfect fit.

591
01:16:57,328 --> 01:16:58,663
Yeah, whatever Trevor.

592
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:01,541
I don't have a size 26 waist here.

593
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,335
Hey, how about that idea.

594
01:17:05,377 --> 01:17:06,962
I can get a job selling man's wear.

595
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:10,675
Those chicks got paid vacations too.

596
01:17:11,384 --> 01:17:12,969
I'll settle for that.

597
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:15,971
That's not a bad life.

598
01:17:16,472 --> 01:17:18,349
Could be worse.
You know whatelse I want to do?

599
01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:23,061
I want to clean up this place,
just get rid of all the fucking junk.

600
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:26,608
Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper,
which I sometimes am...

601
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:30,278
...but I can also be very very,
you know, organised and neat.

602
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,030
And I wanna do more of that.

603
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,073
I would love to paint a place.

604
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:40,579
Just make it nice, just be organised,
and neat and paint it white.

605
01:17:42,873 --> 01:17:46,920
What I would also like is a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.

606
01:18:11,444 --> 01:18:16,699
()Just like a white, beautiful place
and a decent stove.

607
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,326
Not a lot to ask.

608
01:18:21,328 --> 01:18:25,750
Wow, don't look so surprised.
A call girl scrambling eggs...

609
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:32,422
Yeah that's funny,
I dont think I ever cooked for a guy before.

610
01:18:35,551 --> 01:18:36,678
Not even my husband.

611
01:18:40,347 --> 01:18:41,765
Jesus Christ.

612
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:44,101
Where is he?

613
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:46,979
Who?

614
01:18:47,313 --> 01:18:48,189
You know who.

615
01:18:51,067 --> 01:18:52,944
- Trevor.
- Don't.

616
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:57,448
Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?

617
01:18:58,032 --> 01:19:00,576
This, Ivan.

618
01:19:01,618 --> 01:19:03,371
He's your ex, isn't he?

619
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:04,454
What?

620
01:19:04,454 --> 01:19:05,872
Why is he doing this?

621
01:19:06,623 --> 01:19:08,458
Just becuase i'm fucking you, isn't it?

622
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:10,795
Now it all makes sense.

623
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:13,797
I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me.

624
01:19:13,797 --> 01:19:14,673
Where is he?

625
01:19:14,673 --> 01:19:16,842
Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?

626
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:19,011
I don't know what you are talking about, babe.

627
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:21,096
Ah, don't babe me.

628
01:19:22,347 --> 01:19:23,850
Yeah, babe.

629
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:28,813
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
I'll do anything you want, babe.

630
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:33,859
You know what, I don't deserve this.

631
01:19:34,152 --> 01:19:35,028
What did you do?

632
01:19:35,694 --> 01:19:38,822
- Hey!
- Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?

633
01:19:38,823 --> 01:19:39,740
Fuck you!

634
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:42,784
- You left it in my tip jar the other night.
- Bullshit.

635
01:19:42,784 --> 01:19:45,997
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
- Cut the crap, Stevie.

636
01:19:47,038 --> 01:19:51,668
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit.

637
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:56,757
- This says he does.
- Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.

638
01:19:56,757 --> 01:19:58,467
I'm talking about your ex!

639
01:19:58,842 --> 01:19:59,676
Ivan.

640
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:06,350
- Who? This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.

641
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,646
Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you.

642
01:20:11,814 --> 01:20:14,484
You are stading next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

643
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:24,786
That's not me.

644
01:20:29,623 --> 01:20:34,420
Trevor, it's you.
Look.

645
01:20:41,886 --> 01:20:43,971
You lying whore.

646
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:49,726
You get the fuck out.

647
01:20:49,726 --> 01:20:51,520
Fucking freak.

648
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,439
You are a fucking pig

649
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:55,690
You fucking whore

650
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,528
You are a fucking freak.

651
01:20:58,528 --> 01:21:01,280
You are a fucking psycho.

652
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:21,550
Fucking psycho

653
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:53,416
Where is Marie?

654
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:54,708
Who?

655
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,752
You know who.

656
01:21:57,752 --> 01:22:00,840
Marie my waitress.

657
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,592
My! You are chatty tonight.

658
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:08,805
Darling, I am your waitress!

659
01:22:08,805 --> 01:22:09,597
What's going on here?

660
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:11,391
I've never seen you before.

661
01:22:11,391 --> 01:22:13,560
What are you talking about?

662
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:18,773
You come here every night, stay on that same stool, staring at your coffee.

663
01:22:20,443 --> 01:22:24,030
Honest, I am starting to think that you are mute.

664
01:22:24,029 --> 01:22:26,698
I wanna see Marie!

665
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:31,911
Mister, there is no Marie that works here.

666
01:22:34,331 --> 01:22:39,002
Is everybody at it?

667
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:44,215
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.

668
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:48,261
Whatever Ivan was paying you is wasting his money.

669
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:51,097
Go home, Mister.

670
01:22:51,097 --> 01:22:56,311
Get some sleep.

671
01:24:21,729 --> 01:24:26,901
How could you!

672
01:25:47,315 --> 01:25:51,944
You have to pay your utility bill, partner

673
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:56,949
You know how difficult it is to shave in the dark.

674
01:25:56,949 --> 01:26:02,163
What have you done with Nicholas?

675
01:26:02,831 --> 01:26:08,087
What have I done with Nicholas?

676
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:18,180
He can't hear you now, pal.

677
01:26:19,472 --> 01:26:24,644
Oh, come on what know what you is dead. heya

678
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:32,985
You going to do something with that faulty memory of yours. Pal

679
01:26:33,654 --> 01:26:37,366
Might make life a little bit easier.

680
01:26:37,365 --> 01:26:42,578
by the way, I just loved them no chilly myself

681
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:51,755
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.

682
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:58,427
Where is your hospitality, partner?

683
01:27:03,934 --> 01:27:09,189
If some had walked in, he might get the wrong idea.

684
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,609
Who are you?

685
01:29:22,655 --> 01:29:25,242
Oh hell, look like you got
some explaining to do, partner.

686
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:32,100
I know who you are.

687
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:44,523
You going some where, Mr. Reznik?

688
01:32:46,818 --> 01:32:49,737
Yeah, Mrs.shrike, I'm moving.

689
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:51,822
I didn't receive notice.

690
01:32:52,657 --> 01:32:55,493
Your lease requires you
to get 30 days notice in writing.

691
01:32:56,536 --> 01:32:58,997
It wasn't planned,
something came up.

692
01:32:59,747 --> 01:33:03,501
You can keep my security deposite.
I won't be needing it anyway.

693
01:33:06,921 --> 01:33:11,592
Really? Mr. Reznik.
You used to be such a good tenant.

694
01:33:12,969 --> 01:33:14,511
I just don't understand it.

695
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:28,984
Oh, isn't that pretty?

696
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:33,739
Would you care to sell it?

697
01:33:36,451 --> 01:33:38,619
No, it was my mother's.

698
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:46,668
I made all arrangements. Don't move my things.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.

699
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:47,712
You just want to get away...

700
01:33:48,087 --> 01:33:50,298
If you are going to give it away...

701
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:55,552
Mrs. Shrike, If you'll excuse me.

702
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,070
I like to report a hit-and-run.

703
01:35:11,337 --> 01:35:13,089
Some one will record your statement.

704
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:19,761
Later, right now I just want to sleep.

705
01:35:28,354 --> 01:35:30,064
Just want to sleep.
