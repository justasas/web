hear when the young boy Jesus<font color="#E5E5E5"> was lost</font>

487
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,720
for a better of three days or so and

488
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:42,399
they said to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> why didn't you follow</font>

were you and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quietly and</font>

492
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:58,359
very simply whiskey not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am about</font>

493
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,950
my father's business now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> intend</font>

494
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to portray the fact of the father's</font>

495
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">business in itself is selling Bibles for</font>

496
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:07,839
dollars and cents and for the commercial

497
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,180
aspect of it but I do believe the good

498
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,009
that comes from the selling of Bibles

499
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,580
and the getting of Bibles the reading of

500
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:18,910
Bibles is definitely identified with the

501
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:21,159
father's business some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you at one</font>

502
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,830
time or another may or may not have had

503
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,019
a higher income but you have never held

504
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:29,019
a higher position of a steam in the

505
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">minds of the world or in your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> self</font>

506
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:34,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">satisfaction than you now hold knowing</font>

507
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:40,090
what you're doing about your father's

508
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:43,240
business hold your heads very hot be

509
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:46,000
very proud of your position stop

510
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,829
thinking in terms of Bible peddling

511
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,799
because I'm confident that once you

512
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:58,720
realize what you are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for others</font>

513
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:01,419
you and your own esteem will rise so

514
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,839
high not with conceit but in humility

515
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:09,160
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have the privilege of</font>

516
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:11,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the power to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be of service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to others and</font>

she is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what she impacts to them is</font>

1486
01:26:43,019 --> 01:26:47,280
how those children<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grow up</font>

1487
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:49,109
and this is the age when they need it

1488
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:51,448
because of your house<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have a</font>

1489
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:54,059
foundation you've got no kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a house</font>

1490
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:56,608
does that make sense there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there</font>

1491
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:59,309
we exactly what there we are and we have

1492
01:26:56,609 --> 01:27:01,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">them white and red and we give it in any</font>

right down I know the price is something

1497
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:13,409
that doesn't enter in it off it's the

1498
01:27:11,038 --> 01:27:15,809
utility of it and believe you me i think

1499
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:18,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">you both have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree that you have the</font>

1501
01:27:18,118 --> 01:27:26,458
that's all we have to say it's the way

1502
01:27:24,389 --> 01:27:29,520
anything is designed as to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect</font>

1503
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:33,090
you we get from it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just feel sorry</font>

1504
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and demonstration oh I was outside I was</font>
