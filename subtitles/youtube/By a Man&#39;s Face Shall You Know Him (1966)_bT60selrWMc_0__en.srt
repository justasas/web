1
00:00:01,518 --> 00:00:06,500
This film is a fictional tale set in
Japan's Post-war years.

2
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:11,500
The producers of this film made
this drama in the belief...

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,467
that someday mankind
can live in harmony.

4
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:29,109
By a Man's Face Shall You Know Him

Directed by Tai Kato

12
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:58,208
At first, I thought I'd go nuts.

13
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:02,052
But it looks like the construction work
will be finished soon.

14
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,611
Just three more days.

15
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,780
So, they're leaving?

16
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:12,286
Doctor Amamiya, have you given some thought
about the job on the islands?

17
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:17,240
Are you going, or do you have plans for
your eviction compensation fee?

18
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:23,341
I have loan sharks breathing
down my neck.

19
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:28,677
What if I asked you to come
with me to the islands?

20
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,772
I'm not cut out for island life.

21
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:35,075
I don't want to go either.

22
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:39,003
Imagine me a GP on a small island.

23
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,042
That's no kind of life for me.

24
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:46,274
Doctor, I've always wondered...

25
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:51,799
why a man of your ability
is working a job like this.

26
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:02,207
- Doctor, can I use the telephone?
- Go ahead.

27
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,871
Doctor Amamiya!

28
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:34,498
It's a traffic accident.
Any lacerations?

29
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,118
Excessive bleeding.

30
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,244
It looks like the lower half of
his body has been crushed.

31
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,897
Get him on the gurney.

32
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,841
Thank you.

33
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:02,145
We can't handle this here.
He's too badly hurt.

34
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,306
He'll die if we can't get him to
a hospital with better facilities.

35
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:17,127
Choi!

36
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,346
You know him?

37
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,516
Doctor, aren't you going to operate?

38
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,732
I can't here. Contact a hospital
with better facilities.

39
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,658
He'll bleed to death if we move him.

40
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,323
Doctor, there's no time.

41
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:41,000
<i>August 1948
The Nine Heavens League
of Korean nationals...</i>

42
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,100
<i>has gathered volunteers from
around the country</i>

43
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:24,869
Ever since Japan lost the War, ethics and
the rule of law have gone out the window.

44
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,560
The Japs are weak.

45
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,747
We'll create enough turmoil to
tear this country apart.

46
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,504
We'll snatch the New Life Market
from the Japs,

47
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:42,963
and turn it into an entertainment district.

48
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:47,557
That's why I had you gather volunteers
from around the country.

49
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,644
Two, please.

50
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:15,435
What do you got there?

51
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:18,748
Give it back!

52
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:21,777
Doctor, help!

53
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,865
Let go of her.

54
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,346
I said, let go!

55
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,618
Let's go.

56
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:29,641
He owns the market I want
to take over.

57
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:32,326
He's a doctor named Amamiya.

58
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,372
He went to war after graduating
from a university in Tokyo.

59
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,606
He doesn't have any real ties
to the town,

60
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:40,358
but he took over the family practice
after his old man died.

61
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,393
- Blood pressure?
- Below 100.

62
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,789
Keep pumping blood into him.

63
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,240
Scalpel.

64
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:34,682
What kind of a woman do you
plan to marry?

65
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:39,843
Someone from a fine family,
no doubt.

66
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,272
I want you.

67
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:47,299
This is exactly where I want to be.

68
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,374
I love you.

69
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:53,397
I can be your mistress.

70
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,347
Don't say such things.

71
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:59,867
You don't understand.

72
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,322
I love you.

73
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,536
I don't care what happens to me.

74
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,884
- But you...
- I love you, too.

75
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:08,365
Liar!

76
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:12,762
You're the only thing in this world
I can count on.

77
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:17,374
I... killed men in the War.

78
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:24,753
As soon as we lost...
I learned that it was all a lie.

79
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:27,397
Everything.

80
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:31,099
You're the only thing I can
believe in anymore.

81
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,824
Maki.

82
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:08,317
Doctor! What are you doing?!

83
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:11,331
The hospital's closed, so I guess
you boys came here for nothing.

84
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,250
Come back tomorrow.

85
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,412
We need to talk.

86
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:18,230
Come down to the Nine Heavens
League headquarters.

87
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:19,843
I don't think so.

88
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:29,636
The boss, Yoo Seong-Won,
wants to talk to you.

89
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,631
Yoo Seong-Won?

90
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,939
Isn't he a Korean king
or something?

91
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,848
- I ain't got no business with him.
- Don't get smart!

92
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,711
A beat cop is coming.

93
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:43,413
Do I look worried?
Take him to the headquarters.

94
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:45,937
No, let's leave well enough
alone tonight.

95
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,787
You better watch it!

96
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,638
We'll be back!

97
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,453
How'd it go with the country doctor?

98
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:20,498
He talked tough,

99
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:23,062
but it's only a matter of time
before we break him.

100
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,688
We'll bust into his hospital
like that every day.

101
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,525
- Do you think that will work?
- Why wouldn't it?!

102
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,649
What are you talking about?

103
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:34,309
He's not like other Japanese people.

104
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:36,765
- Let's dance.
- Wait.

105
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,172
Do you know him?

106
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:43,737
If you really want the market,

107
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,261
- you should just pay him off now.
- Pay?!

108
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:50,239
That's what I have you idiots for!

109
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:53,751
Look around you:
this is a nice club.

110
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,970
I took it from the Japs.

111
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,166
Hey, tell the manager
not to let sales drop.

112
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,266
Let's dance.

113
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:14,004
- Wait. - But, he...
- Forget about it.

114
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:20,086
He just got out of Japanese prison.

115
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,139
Everything is new to him...

116
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:27,613
but he can fight like a madman
when he gets riled up.

117
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,079
We need him for now.

118
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,486
- Who are you?
- Gye Hye-Chun.

119
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,643
I don't mean your name.

120
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,880
What you're doing here?

121
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:46,147
- I was rescued by the master.
- "The master"?

122
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:48,855
That's what you call
Yoo Seong-Won?

123
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:54,668
It's dangerous.
Sooner or later...

124
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:59,982
He already has, hasn't he?

125
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,120
That jerk.

126
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,999
Go home.

127
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,384
My parents lived their whole lives
under Japanese rule.

128
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:13,746
I'm used to Japan.

129
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:18,311
I was born here,
and I don't know Korea.

130
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,502
Me, too.

131
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,389
Are your parents alive?

132
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,511
An incendiary bomb killed
my entire family.

133
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,824
I told you to leave my sideburns long!

134
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,956
- You did not. - Yes, I did!
I did, I tell you!

135
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,993
I didn't hear you say anything,
mister.

136
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,942
Wait, pay up.

137
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:02,344
If you expect to be paid,
do the job right!

138
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,668
We give you the same haircut
every time.

139
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:06,535
Not this time, you didn't!

140
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,125
You planned to stiff me
from the start.

141
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,367
Of all the nerve, you tramp!

142
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,138
Who's the one with the nerve?
It's you Koreans.

143
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:17,558
Yoko, don't provoke him!

144
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,967
- Pay what you owe!
- Bitch!

145
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,387
Yoko, let him be!

146
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,266
What do you expect from a Korean?!

147
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:51,822
Dad, it's not fair!

148
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:02,201
What the hell are you doing?!

149
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,101
What, the price went up again?

150
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:09,490
Get cheaper ones next time.

151
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,118
- Why don't you talk to me?!
- Yeah, whatever.

152
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,289
You're barking up the wrong tree, mac.

153
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,567
How much do you girls cost?

154
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,950
Do you only fuck Americans?

155
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,521
Soldiers of the Imperial Army
aren't good enough for you, huh?

156
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:36,601
The country is free, women are free,
and the place is a disgrace.

157
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,725
I shouted a banzai when
I heard we lost the War.

158
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,319
What do you think you're doing?!
Wait!

159
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,679
- What?!
- Pay your tab.

160
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,679
My tab?!

161
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,759
Look at this badge;
do you know who I am?

162
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,756
Is that supposed to mean
something to me?!

163
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,454
You deadbeat!

164
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:02,905
Have you ever heard the Japanese expression,
"A fox that borrows the tiger's tail?"

165
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:05,423
You weren't the ones at war!

166
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:26,490
- Gen! Help!
- What is it?

167
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,275
It's one of those rats from the
Nine Heavens League! He's gone crazy!

168
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,365
Those numbskulls are always
up to something.

169
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:33,755
- Get the police!
- I'm going.

170
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,793
Get out of the way!

171
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,221
You're not going to weasel
your way out of this one.

172
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:58,009
He tried to run off from Michiyo's
without paying.

173
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,366
He also beat Tama senseless.

174
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,692
I didn't beat her,
she was doing a strip show!

175
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,383
It's obvious to tell she's
a prostitute!

176
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:13,550
Please, try to remain calm.

177
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,846
- Your name?
- Come again?

178
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:21,026
I'm asking your name!

179
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:23,243
Seo Yeon-Bok.

180
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,254
- I need you to come to the station.
- We don't take orders from Japs!

181
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:35,575
Are you sure you know what
you're getting yourself into?

182
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:52,201
If you don't free Seo this instant,
I'll have the commissioner fired!

183
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:57,249
Japan lost the War.
Your domination of Korea is over!

184
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,738
- Sorry to have to be the one to tell you.
- It serves you right!

185
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:10,132
It might have been a mistake
to arrest Seo.

186
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:14,853
But letting him go for no good
reason will only stir up...

187
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,923
resentment in the market.

188
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:22,145
US General Headquarters already issued
an order that all foreigners...

189
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:25,400
- are subject to Japanese law.
- I'm well aware of that.

190
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,158
But still, we lost the War and
the country is under occupation.

191
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,813
The US forces avoid conflict with
the Chinese and Koreans.

192
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:36,554
Their circumstances are unusual,
and they use bribes and violence.

193
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:42,706
If I'm not mistaken, they use a taxi
and transport company as a front.

194
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,880
But of course their real business
is black market goods.

195
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,886
Their boss is Yoo Seong-Won,
a vicious criminal and seven-time loser.

196
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,596
Sit down.

197
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,966
The police couldn't have
just released Seo on our say so.

198
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,095
They're up to something.

199
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:06,028
What did you tell the barber
and the barmaid?

200
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,529
We asked for •25,000 in damages
from each for insulting Seo.

201
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,153
Idiot, squeeze them for
more than that!

202
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,629
This isn't just about Seo,
it's an insult to all Koreans.

203
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:18,290
I want •500,000.

204
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:22,689
No, •1 million.
Tell them •1 million.

205
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,571
Hey, Gen's back.

206
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:29,128
Gen, what happened?

207
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,692
We lost this one.

208
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,548
The police called the army,

209
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,034
but the case isn't black and white,
and it didn't go anywhere.

210
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:50,778
They were more interested in
clamping down on the black market.

211
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:52,519
That's ridiculous!

212
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,824
They call it the black market, but it's the
only way to put food on the table!

213
00:19:57,023 --> 00:20:01,467
Are the police going to target us,
or the Nine Heavens League?

214
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,814
You have to tell us!

215
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:06,063
Don't take it out on Gen.

216
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:11,071
Gen, are you saying that the police
can't touch Korean residents?

217
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,847
What will happen to ordinary
Japanese people?

218
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,506
The bottom line is that
we're responsible...

219
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:21,525
for protecting the interests of the
New Life Market ourselves.

220
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:24,891
You say that even as the Heaven's League
is rounding up as many members as it can.

221
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,212
Are you going to fight when they
try to force you out?

222
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:30,025
What about when they
try to bleed you for •1 million?

223
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:32,352
What other choice do we have?

224
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,204
By the way, what happened with the
barber on the main shopping boulevard?

225
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:44,203
- I haven't seen hide nor hair of him.
- Yeah, what's he doing?

226
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:45,619
Will you shut up!

227
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:52,551
The shopping boulevard and the
New Life Market are business rivals.

228
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,546
Once the Koreans take over,
our rivalry won't matter much.

229
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:57,990
- That's right, look at my cuts here!
- Shut up!

230
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,180
Dammit, all the businesses on the
shopping boulevard hate us,

231
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,473
and even though the Koreans are trying to
take over, we still can't count on them.

232
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:10,817
We're on our own. We fought and
suffered through the War,

233
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:13,375
we won't go down without
a fight.

234
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:15,719
Am I right?!

235
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,462
But there are hundreds of them,
and hundreds more coming for all we know.

236
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,433
How do you suggest we fight?

237
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,434
I can't believe I'm saying this,

238
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:34,674
but we need help from
the Onogawa gang.

239
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,298
You want to get in bed with
the mob?

240
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,776
We don't have a choice.

241
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:43,135
It's the reason we pay them off
every month.

242
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,007
I'll go and talk to them.
Come on.

243
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:02,298
Hey, Gen. Where are you going?

244
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:04,753
I'm going to see your mob boss.

245
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:22,971
I heard...
I know all about it.

246
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:24,933
Sit down.

247
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:32,344
I think you're talking to
the wrong person.

248
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:37,511
- I don't think so...
- I don't have the muscle I used to.

249
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:41,127
Sir, we got your back.

250
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:45,454
You say the word,
and we'll lay down our lives.

251
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:48,747
Shut up!
I didn't ask your opinion.

252
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:54,496
I'm sorry to betray your trust,

253
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:57,589
but we lost most of our
young men in the War,

254
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,716
and I can't see any way that
we could win this fight.

255
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:04,528
Sir, don't you care if you
lose the market?

256
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,918
- Kubota, Mr. Onogawa didn't say that.
- Think about it.

257
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:11,725
My men and I will do what we can
to save the market.

258
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:16,399
But if I put every man I have into
this fight, we'll lose everything.

259
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,485
That's a fact.

260
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:22,486
Then you're going to leave us
out to dry?

261
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:24,048
Let's go.

262
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:29,464
Hold on.

263
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:34,911
The man who can help you is
a doctor named Amamiya.

264
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:36,696
Amamiya?

265
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:40,104
- Yeah, he owns the land that the
New Life Market is on. - That young fella?

266
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:42,334
What can that hayseed doctor
do for us?

267
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:47,397
Don't underestimate him.
He's fearless and he's strong.

268
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:53,209
Once my boys were foolish enough
to mess with his nurse.

269
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,887
He mopped up the floor with them.

270
00:23:57,086 --> 00:24:00,849
- Isn't that so?
- Yes, he was one tough customer.

271
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:07,331
He's the owner of the market.

272
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,132
With him leading the cause, you'll be
an army. A braver man you'll never find.

273
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:15,468
He was a lion on the battlefield
in the War.

274
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:19,005
I hope I've convinced you.

275
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,166
<i>Amamiya Hospital</i>

276
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,303
Excuse me for a moment.

277
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:26,915
Is he all right?

278
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:30,280
He looks like a street thug.

279
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,472
- A nurse can handle it.
- Doctor...

280
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,923
I can't help you.

281
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:39,595
In the first place,
you can't ask a doctor to fight.

282
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:43,433
We're not.
We just want you to advise us.

283
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:46,099
I don't know anything about the law.

284
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,713
The law isn't helping us.
That's why we came to you.

285
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:54,422
But the law should prevail
in all matters.

286
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:59,459
But if the Koreans take the market,
you won't get any rent.

287
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,820
In fact, you'll probably lose
the land, too.

288
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,554
I'm not collecting any rent now.

289
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:09,534
But Onogawa's boys are always
coming around to collect rent.

290
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:13,728
- They're acting on their own behalf.
- They're ripping us off?!

291
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:19,596
Doctor, come quick.

292
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,884
The Nine Heavens League brought all of
the girls from their cabaret club.

293
00:25:23,085 --> 00:25:24,983
They insist you give them
physical exams immediately.

294
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:28,237
Hey, hurry it up, here!

295
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:32,426
We have to get back to work!
Time is money and all that jazz!

296
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:37,038
- I donít want any lip outta you!
- You don't even have an appointment!

297
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,623
I'm not going to do this!

298
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,581
- We're not screwing around here, bitch!
- Hold still!

299
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:49,017
I'll do the physical exam,
but not today.

300
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:51,840
I have house calls to make,
come back tomorrow.

301
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,672
What time?

302
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:57,307
I want it now. Do it.

303
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,142
Go get it done somewhere else.

304
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:01,824
What did you say?

305
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:04,719
I've got a right to good health!

306
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,303
Please, stop!

307
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:10,537
You have a responsibility
as a doctor.

308
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,512
Unless you got a problem with
treating me...

309
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:17,085
I'm sorry, doctor.

310
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,214
Last night, I was ready to fight
a couple of Yanks...

311
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,323
over some girls,
but he was too yellow to fight.

312
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:25,788
Go home!

313
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:27,711
All right.

314
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,639
OK, everybody,

315
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:36,394
it looks like the doc won't see us.

316
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,001
You bastard!

317
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:00,234
Stop!

318
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,056
Gye, stay back.

319
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,716
Help!

320
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:12,623
Doctor, make them stop!

321
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,891
- You cretins!
- Who did it?!

322
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:29,294
Gye!

323
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:31,961
Get her into the examination room.

324
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,966
- Get out of the way!
- I didn't ask you for help!

325
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:39,474
You're playing with her life.
Head trauma is often fatal.

326
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,348
Don't you care?

327
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:45,088
Then we'll stay while you treat her.

328
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,953
Get out,
you'll just get under foot.

329
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:49,588
If you don't like it,
take her to another doctor.

330
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:52,647
But if she dies, her blood is on your hands.
What's it gonna be then?!

331
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:54,875
What should we do?

332
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:57,019
She'll be all right, won't she?

333
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,922
If you make a hash of this,
we'll get you!

334
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:05,652
You better believe it!

335
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,765
Let's get everyone together again.

336
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:21,260
If worse comes to worse,
at least we've gotten the doctor involved.

337
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:49,418
Doctor, marry me.

338
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,345
Where did that come from?

339
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,750
I want to marry you!

340
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:55,416
This is a bit sudden.

341
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:59,105
I'm frightened! Hold me!

342
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:02,283
Imai is coming.
Why are you scared?

343
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:05,538
I'm scared that you're going to leave.

344
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:09,001
- Who told you such a silly thing?
- I don't care if you think I'm a fool.

345
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:11,761
I don't want you to go anywhere,
and I don't want to lose you to anyone.

346
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:15,962
I don't expect you to understand
someone like me,

347
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:19,072
but my body wants you.

348
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:27,638
Just now, I saw your eyes when that mobster
came in half-dead from the Koreans.

349
00:29:27,688 --> 00:29:32,282
They were the eyes of a man
who had no one to turn to.

350
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,892
I'll love you with my body,

351
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:38,822
and then part of me will be inside you,
no matter what happens.

352
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:41,851
That's why I spoke so suddenly.

353
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:44,263
It's your eyes!

354
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:49,024
Maki, what do I mean to you?

355
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:53,046
Marry me. It's the only way
I can be sure you won't leave.

356
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:54,961
What's the point?

357
00:29:55,162 --> 00:30:00,075
It'd be no different than those punks
acting so tough the other day.

358
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:02,755
What's it got to do with us?

359
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:08,569
I'm a woman...
Just a woman.

360
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:18,729
Doctor, it's time for your house calls.

361
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:33,068
Doctor!

362
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,473
Is she going to be all right?

363
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:50,319
- Doctor.
- Don't interrupt!

364
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:55,224
I came here as soon as I heard.

365
00:30:55,424 --> 00:30:59,124
Yes, but I only told them she might
die to get rid of them. It was a threat.

366
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,599
She should wake up soon.

367
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,057
For now, let her sleep.

368
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:06,720
Is she your girl?

369
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:11,016
When I was on the front,
and my life was on the line,

370
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:13,460
there was one man I could trust -

371
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,916
not as an officer...
but as a human being.

372
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:19,247
That was Army Medic Amamiya.

373
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:26,282
If everyone was like this girl
and Dr. Amamiya,

374
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:29,535
there'd be a whole lot less misery
in the world.

375
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,490
Cut the theatrics, Shibata.

376
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,822
You are Private Shibata,
aren't you?

377
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,880
Please call me Choi.

378
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:39,566
Choi Mun-Gye.

379
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:42,030
I'm not trying to pass as
Japanese anymore.

380
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,109
Tell me one thing:

381
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,768
If you realize the futility of killing
your fellow man in war,

382
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:52,086
how did you wind up in the mob?

383
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,793
The battlefield was futile,

384
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:57,076
but this is different.

385
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,938
Now we're fighting for ourselves.

386
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:03,209
- For our own kind.
- And her?

387
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:13,809
It's payback for payback,
and it never ends.

388
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:19,171
Does that mean you're going to hand over
the market to Yoo Seong-Won without a fight?

389
00:32:21,827 --> 00:32:24,124
Got an answer?

390
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:26,171
Hell if I know!

391
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:10,016
I know I'm a medic,
but I'm the ranking officer.

392
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:12,526
I'm taking command of this unit!

393
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,597
Sir, there are civilians on the other side
of that hill waiting to be rescued.

394
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:34,728
<i>Attention,
brave Japanese soldiers,</i>

395
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,545
<i>please abandon your vain efforts
to win this war.</i>

396
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:45,463
<i>No man who throws down his rifle
will be killed.</i>

397
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:50,216
<i>Everyone, please come out.</i>

398
00:33:50,977 --> 00:33:53,788
I will personally kill any man who...

399
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:57,384
attempts to disgrace the
Imperial Army of Japan by surrendering.

400
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,380
I'll cut you down!

401
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,729
Let's go.
I'll lead the group and so,

402
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:10,173
- What, you coward!
- if the Americans don't keep their word,

403
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:13,747
- I'll die and you all can take cover.
- I'll go, too.

404
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:17,268
You Korean dog!

405
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:25,053
I'll kill any man who surrenders!

406
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:27,335
If I'm to die,

407
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:35,090
I want to at least see
the light of day one last time!

408
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,675
Sir, let me go, too!

409
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:53,106
Cooper scissors.

410
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:34,690
Who are you?

411
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:38,405
Haruko. Choi Haruko.

412
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:41,120
Sai? Then...

413
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,830
How's daddy?

414
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,662
He's asleep.
Did you come by yourself?

415
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:49,322
The policeman brought me.

416
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,021
Mommy's gone today.

417
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:53,728
Where's your mommy?

418
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:57,071
She went to Tokyo.
She said she'd be back today.

419
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:59,199
Daddy doesn't know,

420
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,905
but mommy went to ask if it was OK
for us to go back to Korea.

421
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,028
You're name's Haruko?

422
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:13,297
Is your mommy Japanese?

423
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:17,205
- Do you and your mommy want to go
to your daddy's country? - I don't know.

424
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,431
Hello, sir.

425
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:23,655
- I was just checking up on the girl.
- I just heard.

426
00:36:23,856 --> 00:36:26,054
This is the owner of the car that
ran over that nogoodnik.

427
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:28,447
I already questioned him.

428
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:31,387
Doctor, pleased to meet you.

429
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,427
I'm the CEO of four companies.
I'm a busy man.

430
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:44,615
This is the daughter of the man
you ran over.

431
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:48,165
We had a bad accident.
Didn't we?

432
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:04,810
Hey, can you write your
name and address?

433
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,096
Write it for the man.

434
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:18,846
Choi? You're Korean.

435
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:39,288
Good job.

436
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:48,115
We have another engagement to tend to,
so you'll have to excuse us. Sir?

437
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:49,467
Wait!

438
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,800
Oh, yes...
Your fee for the surgery.

439
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,818
You jackass! Apologize to
the little girl, blue blood!

440
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:58,487
Who is this doctor?
Is he yakuza?

441
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:01,101
And who are you?!
Are you human?!

442
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,532
Doctor, come quick!

443
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:06,644
- What is it? -  His stomach is swelling.
It looks like bleeding. - What?

444
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:07,966
Are you threatening me?

445
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,540
If you have a grievance,
please consult my attorney.

446
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,771
I'm going to report you to
the medical association!

447
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:13,323
You'll never work again!

448
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:25,630
Leave me alone?!

449
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,855
Help!

450
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,382
What's that?

451
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:26,453
They're having a little rumpy pumpy
in the outdoors. How about we try it, babe?

452
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:29,289
No way,
we can get a hotel room!

453
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:45,333
I've got tired blood,

454
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:48,381
maybe I'll see the doctor later.

455
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,929
What's going on?

456
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,137
Yoko, the barber's daughter,
has been killed.

457
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:58,580
Her body turned up by the bridge.
That's what I heard.

458
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,668
It was so grisly,
I couldn't bear to look!

459
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:02,134
Yoko!

460
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,581
Why are you taking her photo?!

461
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:07,408
Mr. Minegishi, please!
We need evidence.

462
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:09,863
Please get off of her.
Get up.

463
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:12,155
Get a hold of yourself.
We're collecting evidence.

464
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:16,688
- Minegishi! Evidence!
- I can tell you what happened!

465
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:19,349
It was the Nine Heavens League.

466
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,451
Someone saw those Koreans follow Yoko
when she came out of the public bath!

467
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:28,317
- Give me a name!
- That's your job!

468
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:32,389
You know it's the Koreans,
and you're scared to act.

469
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,621
- I... I...
- Mr. Minegishi, calm down.

470
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,663
- We need evidence.
- Dammit!

471
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:43,324
I raised her by myself,
and now Yoko's dead!

472
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:48,300
The poor child! Yoko!

473
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,764
Whaddya you want, old man?!

474
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:01,347
Give me the man who killed
my daughter!

475
00:41:01,547 --> 00:41:04,000
Oh, so you're the barber.

476
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:07,069
Your daughter's dead and
you're mad with grief.

477
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,132
You can't hide him -

478
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:11,847
someone saw his face!

479
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:14,002
Then tell the police.

480
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:18,608
Hand him over!
I want him!

481
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,830
- What are you talking about?
- Murderers!

482
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,518
You're all murderers!

483
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,536
You're parasites who prey
on the weak!

484
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,201
Parasites?!

485
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:35,345
Look what you Japs did in Korea
a few years ago!

486
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:37,467
What's the life of one girl
in comparison?!

487
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,405
Hey, someone help him!

488
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:23,396
We have to save him!

489
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,788
What's happened to this town?

490
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:28,203
This isn't any kind of place
for people to live!

491
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:31,367
You're my brother,
what do you think?

492
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:34,405
Shuichi, isn't Japan a civilized nation?

493
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:38,709
Is a national confession of culpability
tantamount to a pledge of cowardice?

494
00:42:39,777 --> 00:42:43,190
Why did we lose one war
and now another?

495
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:46,048
I believe in such a thing
as good and evil.

496
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:48,513
I wish the police did, too!

497
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:51,063
Doesn't anyone but me care?

498
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:54,603
- It's all we can do to put food
on the table. - Maki!

499
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:56,634
Excuse me.

500
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:59,699
What the hell are you mumbling about?!

501
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,106
Stand tall and be proud!

502
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:05,963
Pride won't put food in my stomach!
But a rich brat like you wouldn't understand!

503
00:43:06,023 --> 00:43:07,951
Can't you see that our
emotional distress...

504
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,427
has ruined the reconstruction
of Japan?

505
00:43:10,628 --> 00:43:12,671
We need to recover a sense
of national cohesion.

506
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:15,209
Knowing that doesn't do a bit of good!

507
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:18,293
- Maki, please calm down.
- No, I won't! You idiot,

508
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:21,649
if you want national cohesion,
you can start with your brother.

509
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,038
You come home from your university in Tokyo
and practically bite his head off!

510
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,634
Doctor.

511
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,916
Are you in pain?

512
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,896
Shit, I can't believe it!

513
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:42,458
It looks like you're feeling better.

514
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:45,019
I thought we were going to lose you.

515
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:46,483
Shuichi!

516
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:54,739
Eat up...
It's my own recipe.

517
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:58,063
It's better than a restaurant.

518
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:08,621
Hey, how's school?

519
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:11,240
What classes are you taking
this semester?

520
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:14,007
Aren't you going to eat?

521
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:16,606
You've changed.

522
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:18,311
Have I?

523
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:22,943
We enjoy more freedom than ever before.

524
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:24,816
Why don't you do something?

525
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:28,516
Social change through action.

526
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:30,967
The Nine Heavens League are doing
just that through violence.

527
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,188
And they're succeeding quite well.

528
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:37,003
- Are you suggesting I go around
beating them up? - No, I'm not.

529
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:39,225
But it's eye for an eye.

530
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:43,050
If someone stands up to them,
he'll find hundreds follow along.

531
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,920
Japanese people are good
at following along.

532
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,112
And betrayal.

533
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:57,018
Hey, wait.

534
00:44:57,217 --> 00:44:58,710
Wait.

535
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:02,306
Don't you care what happens
to this town?

536
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:07,408
Don't close yourself up in
your own little world.

537
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:09,206
It's defeatist.

538
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:13,460
I'm tired of fighting...
And I saw enough killing on the front!

539
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:16,534
You act like fighting in the War...

540
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:18,780
gave you some kind of
a special privilege.

541
00:45:19,157 --> 00:45:21,851
But I want to fight in a war, too!

542
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:25,876
If we had won that war,
you'd be dancing...

543
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:30,050
cheek-to-cheek with some
Hollywood starlet right now.

544
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,228
You don't have the foggiest notion
of what war is like!

545
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,605
You disappoint me...

546
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:38,320
You're a coward.

547
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:42,666
Wait! Shunji!

548
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,445
Hey, doc, is he your brother?

549
00:45:54,644 --> 00:45:58,766
He's cute.
Can I have him?

550
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,588
Shut up.
Come here, Gye.

551
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:07,119
Hey, I found him first!

552
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,601
Hey, mister, this tramp works at
that Korean cabaret club.

553
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,119
Be careful with her.

554
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:19,166
Get out of here!

555
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:23,764
I can't believe that you had
the nerve to come.

556
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:28,198
Your friends raped and killed
a local girl.

557
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:33,213
If it wasn't for us, they would have
killed her father, too.

558
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:35,590
Shunji!

559
00:46:35,981 --> 00:46:39,655
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

560
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:43,592
Get out!

561
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:45,976
Don't come here again!

562
00:46:46,175 --> 00:46:48,378
- Get out!
- Shunji!

563
00:46:50,347 --> 00:46:52,740
This is a patient!

564
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:03,467
- Were you laughing at me?
- No, of course not.

565
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:06,954
- I think you were!
- No, I'm sorry.

566
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:38,669
Please forgive me!

567
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,940
I just want to pay my respects.

568
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,792
You wanna get beat up again?!

569
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,314
Stop!

570
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:31,728
We'll get you for this!

571
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:48,015
How dare you bring offerings
to the funeral!

572
00:48:48,215 --> 00:48:50,479
Did you think we'd forget that
you killed Yoko?!

573
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:57,844
Shunji was fighting the Koreans?

574
00:48:58,045 --> 00:49:00,715
- Is he all right?
- He disappeared at the market.

575
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:02,796
Do you know where he is?

576
00:49:02,996 --> 00:49:07,000
Your brother has put us in
a difficult position.

577
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:12,402
The Koreans are out for blood and
your brother is missing.

578
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:15,637
We don't have the manpower for this.

579
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:20,864
If he comes back here,
don't let him out again.

580
00:49:21,063 --> 00:49:22,673
All right.

581
00:49:25,592 --> 00:49:30,112
Wow, what are you doing here?

582
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:33,385
Are you here to collect on a bill
from the hospital?

583
00:49:33,585 --> 00:49:35,766
I'd like a drink, please.

584
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:41,009
Is it a jilted lover,
a tiff with the doctor?

585
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,092
Do you have any snacks?

586
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:46,150
I asked you a question.

587
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:48,778
Did you have a fight with the doctor?

588
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:51,681
I've seen it a thousand times, honey.

589
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,581
When are you getting married?

590
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:57,027
Why do I have to get married?

591
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:02,425
You're just going to end up
getting hurt.

592
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:05,828
Men are all the same.

593
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:10,884
"Love in its most perfect form
is unrequited" - Osamu Dazai.

594
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:20,769
Do nurses make good money?

595
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:32,809
Where's the doctor's little brother,
Shunji?

596
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,571
His little brother...

597
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:41,199
There are no johns here, girls.
Not at this hour.

598
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,096
Those bozos from the
Nine Heavens League...

599
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:49,927
are hanging around and
scaring off all the men.

600
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:51,990
It's slim picking here, too.

601
00:50:52,976 --> 00:50:56,202
Could one of you just tell me
where Shunji is?

602
00:50:56,402 --> 00:51:01,682
He's out stirring up trouble between the
two groups and it's just going to snowball.

603
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:06,105
You sound just like the doctor.

604
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:12,193
Shunji, everybody's here!

605
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:13,859
Ok, let's roll!

606
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,888
- We'll show them!
- Shunji!

607
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:20,532
Don't interfere!

608
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:25,300
This is insanity!

609
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:28,336
- What are you talking about?!
- I'll tell the cops! - You're a spy!

610
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:31,766
Watch her until we get back.

611
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:35,089
Shunji!

612
00:51:35,757 --> 00:51:37,942
Give 'em hell!

613
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,989
Where's your boss?!

614
00:52:25,036 --> 00:52:27,297
Customers, out!

615
00:52:27,496 --> 00:52:30,599
I want the leader of the
Nine Heavens League!

616
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,435
Where do you think you are?
Get out!

617
00:52:33,635 --> 00:52:37,543
We can't get anything from
a toady like you... give us Yoo!

618
00:52:37,742 --> 00:52:40,706
We're not taking it anymore,
give us Yoo!

619
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,199
I'm Yoo Seong-Won.

620
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,389
- State your business.
- We want you out of the market.

621
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:53,572
Is that yes or no?!

622
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:57,076
- And if I say no?
- We'll do this!

623
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,829
Yeah, I got it.

624
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,077
I have just one thing to say
to you mutts:

625
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:09,475
You brought this on yourselves.

626
00:53:09,675 --> 00:53:13,112
We're only fighting back.
This blood will be on your hands.

627
00:53:13,313 --> 00:53:15,123
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's get 'em!

628
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,099
Laddie buck, let's go.

629
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:31,288
I heard that you were Amamiya's
kid brother. You fight good.

630
00:54:31,487 --> 00:54:33,670
Now go home,
before you get hurt.

631
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:38,818
Get out or I'll shoot you dead!

632
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,893
Don't run!

633
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:54,467
The market is as good as mine.

634
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:58,775
- You have to stop fighting.
- I will, just as soon as they do.

635
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:01,679
Then the fighting will just
continue forever.

636
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,893
I...

637
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:32,929
If it gives you peace,

638
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:35,867
you can rape me.

639
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:42,894
If it will quench your anger.

640
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:52,690
And why not?

641
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,011
What's wrong?

642
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:20,429
I'm not like that.

643
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:26,201
I saw it the first time we met.

644
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:29,289
You're a good man.

645
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:41,123
You're... You're beautiful.

646
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:03,442
- You set me up!
- No, I didn't. - Liar!

647
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,416
Take him to the headquarters.

648
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:24,396
You're awake.

649
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,837
It's me.

650
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:32,221
Dr. Amamiya...

651
00:58:35,503 --> 00:58:39,623
- Where am I?
- At my hospital.

652
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:42,351
It's not like before, though.

653
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:47,290
Dr. Amamiya,
don't let me die.

654
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:53,630
I need to live for my wife
and daughter.

655
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:56,646
Your daughter's here.

656
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:58,744
She's a sweet kid.

657
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:00,907
Yes, Doctor.

658
00:59:12,543 --> 00:59:15,480
- Haruko.
- Daddy!

659
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:20,769
Did you come here by yourself?

660
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:27,399
Don't cry.

661
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:33,121
Daddy will be better soon.

662
00:59:33,322 --> 00:59:35,664
Doctor, his blood pressure's falling.

663
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:43,547
<i>Repeat surgeries of this kind have
a mortality rate of 90%.</i>

664
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,712
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

665
00:59:46,913 --> 00:59:49,333
<i>But, why me?</i>

666
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:55,959
<i>I'll have taken the life of
this little girl's father.</i>

667
00:59:56,608 --> 01:00:00,632
<i>Damn it all, I'm a doctor!</i>

668
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:02,389
<i>Still...</i>

669
01:00:20,025 --> 01:00:22,392
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

670
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:27,527
<i>At that time...
The incident at the market.</i>

671
01:00:27,726 --> 01:00:30,587
<i>I stood up and fought.</i>

672
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:33,817
<i>Why? I didn't want to.</i>

673
01:00:34,018 --> 01:00:36,760
<i>Forget about it.</i>

674
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,099
<i>I went to prison.</i>

675
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,519
<i>Eight years.</i>

676
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:45,567
<i>Maki visited me.</i>

677
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:10,887
<i>Oh, yeah...
Just like I thought.</i>

678
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,396
<i>As soon as the Nine Heaven's League
were gone, the Onogawa gang took their place.</i>

679
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:17,467
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

680
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:20,704
<i>What was worse was what the
townspeople did to the doctor.</i>

681
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:25,430
<i>She told me about what was
going on in the town.</i>

682
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:28,072
<i>I was sad that I couldn't...</i>

683
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:32,056
<i>touch her through the wire mesh
in the visiting room.</i>

684
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,413
<i>I noticed that she...</i>

685
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:38,618
<i>was no longer the woman I remembered.
I was dismayed.</i>

686
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:42,557
<i>I truly loved Maki then.</i>

687
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:45,076
I have to go now, Doctor.

688
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:46,630
Don't go.

689
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:50,887
Doctor, please believe me:

690
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,375
You're the only man I ever loved.

691
01:01:57,106 --> 01:01:58,644
Goodbye.

692
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:02,254
Maki! Maki!

693
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:08,804
You're making a mistake!
This is a mistake!

694
01:02:18,356 --> 01:02:23,174
<i>At that time, the Nine Heavens League
had taken Shunji hostage.</i>

695
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,695
<i>They told me that if I wanted
my brother back alive,</i>

696
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:29,717
<i>I'd have to hand over the deed
to the New Life Market.</i>

697
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:31,483
<i>And that if I refused,</i>

698
01:02:31,684 --> 01:02:35,918
<i>they would not hesitate to attack
the New Life Market.</i>

699
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:38,605
<i>The police recognized that
this was no idle threat,</i>

700
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:42,554
<i>and released Seo Yeon-Bok from jail
in a bid to appease them.</i>

701
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:50,795
How do you like them apples?!

702
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:54,257
Come on out and take a look,
you sons of bitches!

703
01:02:54,456 --> 01:02:58,304
The cops let me out of the clink!

704
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:06,981
It's too late to try to kiss
and make up!

705
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:45,989
It's the deed to the land the
New Life Market is on.

706
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:49,438
Now hand over Shunji.

707
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:03,143
Once we've taken possession of it.

708
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:06,699
- That's not the deal.
- Suck it up.

709
01:04:19,418 --> 01:04:22,543
Well, well.

710
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:26,846
This is a cute bluff.

711
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:30,346
You haven't signed the deed
over to me.

712
01:04:30,858 --> 01:04:36,168
I will, once you give me Shunji.

713
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:41,515
You've certainly got chutzpah.

714
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:43,743
We should work together.

715
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:47,097
You'll have more money
than you can spend,

716
01:04:47,297 --> 01:04:51,110
and I'll toss your brother in
as a signing bonus.

717
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,347
And if I say no?

718
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,603
Mr. Yoo.

719
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,551
Please let me handle this.

720
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:07,239
Choi!

721
01:05:14,668 --> 01:05:16,074
Fine.

722
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:53,163
The alcohol hasn't been delivered yet.

723
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:57,639
- Water'll do.
- Water.

724
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:06,815
I didn't want to meet you like this.

725
01:06:07,014 --> 01:06:11,704
- You of all people.
- Be grateful you survived.

726
01:06:12,143 --> 01:06:14,289
Oh yeah?

727
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:17,427
- Oh yeah.
- But...

728
01:06:20,713 --> 01:06:24,251
Your brother is a bit too brave
for his own good.

729
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:31,226
Amamiya, a turf war over this market
is inevitable.

730
01:06:32,516 --> 01:06:35,779
Defeat... Death...

731
01:06:36,864 --> 01:06:40,885
I just want Shunji back safely.

732
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:42,945
Doctor, you're gutless!

733
01:06:43,146 --> 01:06:46,238
Don't you care about anyone
but yourself?

734
01:06:46,438 --> 01:06:49,476
Defeat and death...

735
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:53,215
See you later, Amamiya.

736
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:42,842
The sales at the Niagara...

737
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:50,348
I want to help Amamiya's kid brother.

738
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:13,967
- How's that punk kid?
- I took care of him real nice.

739
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:16,886
Some of the junior members are
babysitting him now.

740
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:30,613
Drink.

741
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:43,540
When we caught you, you said
Gye Hye-Chun ratted you out.

742
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:46,652
You said she lied to you.
<i>You're</i> the liar!

743
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,652
There are no rats in our ranks.

744
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:56,363
We snuck up so neither of you
would notice.

745
01:09:04,222 --> 01:09:06,773
And another thing:

746
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:11,358
Your brother brought the deed to the
New Life Market to save your neck.

747
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:16,871
Once your brother signs it,
it will belong to Mr. Yoo.

748
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,394
It will be an entertainment district.

749
01:09:19,595 --> 01:09:24,458
The Japs will take it in their stride
and enjoy the place.

750
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:27,754
The Japs have short memories...

751
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:30,318
but we don't!

752
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:36,811
Shuichi.

753
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:53,254
Is this Amamiya?

754
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:57,481
You have till noon tomorrow.

755
01:09:57,681 --> 01:10:00,688
If you're even a minute late,
we'll attack the market.

756
01:10:00,889 --> 01:10:04,485
<i>There will be fighting in the streets.
Do you understand?</i>

757
01:10:04,685 --> 01:10:06,826
<i>This will ostensibly be revenge for what
you Japs did at the Niagara.</i>

758
01:10:07,027 --> 01:10:09,131
<i>We've got the moral high ground here.</i>

759
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:11,918
<i>The market belongs to the Koreans now.</i>

760
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:16,974
<i>I know you don't want that kind
of bloodshed.</i>

761
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:20,311
<i>Don't you want to save the life of
your only brother?</i>

762
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:21,761
<i>It makes sense.</i>

763
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:25,771
If you don't sign that deed over to me,
the streets will run red with blood.

764
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:30,345
That's the long and the short of it.
Amamiya, sign the deed.

765
01:10:53,051 --> 01:10:54,936
Shunji!

766
01:10:55,136 --> 01:10:58,359
- Shunji!
- Can you walk?

767
01:11:17,747 --> 01:11:19,635
You son of a bitch!

768
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:26,314
Stop!

769
01:12:43,654 --> 01:12:46,127
Kill Choi!

770
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:42,270
Doctor...

771
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:50,233
I'll arrest you if you try to get
revenge for this.

772
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:57,203
Doctor, he's over here.

773
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:05,134
- Alcohol.
- Yes.

774
01:14:07,296 --> 01:14:09,137
Gauze.

775
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:19,585
I need a cloth.

776
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:30,531
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

777
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:32,559
Shibata...

778
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:36,458
Call me Choi.

779
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:40,893
You'll always be Shibata to me.

780
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:43,824
<i>Listen up!</i>

781
01:14:44,024 --> 01:14:47,597
<i>We want you out of the New Life Market
by noon tomorrow!</i>

782
01:14:47,797 --> 01:14:50,485
<i>Amamiya has signed the deed
over to us!</i>

783
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,824
We are appropriating this land!

784
01:14:54,024 --> 01:14:57,378
Anyone still here at noon
will be killed!

785
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,747
To the last man!

786
01:15:00,947 --> 01:15:02,846
Make no mistake!

787
01:15:12,436 --> 01:15:15,782
Doctor, could we...

788
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:48,617
You intend to take action,
don't you?

789
01:15:49,297 --> 01:15:52,761
You can count on me.

790
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:55,687
Thanks, but no thanks.

791
01:15:55,886 --> 01:15:57,672
What?

792
01:15:57,872 --> 01:15:59,643
I don't want your help.

793
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:02,882
I fight my own battles.

794
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:05,756
It's revenge.

795
01:16:06,246 --> 01:16:08,524
I'll die.

796
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:11,654
It may be a mistake,

797
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:18,189
but I see no other way to stop
the cycle of hate and bloodshed.

798
01:16:18,389 --> 01:16:19,960
Doctor...

799
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,845
Let it go.

800
01:16:22,046 --> 01:16:24,390
I have a favor to ask.

801
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:27,350
Take care of the injured guy
at the bar.

802
01:16:28,257 --> 01:16:34,228
I'll take him someplace safe.

803
01:16:34,429 --> 01:16:37,016
Also, doctor,

804
01:16:40,256 --> 01:16:42,854
take this.

805
01:16:46,217 --> 01:16:51,244
I'd like to be alone now.

806
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:42,497
Are you going to do the
same thing as Shunji?

807
01:17:42,698 --> 01:17:46,505
Take care of things after I'm gone.

808
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:53,612
You're going to leave me?

809
01:17:53,813 --> 01:17:57,635
You're the only one I can count on.

810
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,474
- Where's Nurse Imai?
- She went back to her hometown.

811
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:10,387
It ain't much,
but it will help you get by.

812
01:18:10,948 --> 01:18:13,588
And take care of Choi.

813
01:18:13,788 --> 01:18:17,340
Is that all you have to say to me?!

814
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:20,068
That's it?!

815
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:25,095
How can you be so cruel?!

816
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,227
Everybody, get ready!

817
01:18:54,503 --> 01:18:57,779
I don't want to give up!

818
01:18:57,979 --> 01:19:01,818
Do you know how hard it is for
a woman to get this far?

819
01:19:02,019 --> 01:19:05,301
- We're all in the same boat!
- We can't give up!

820
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:07,480
We'll be killed if we stay!

821
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,005
<i>New Life Market</i>

822
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,967
Stop here!

823
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:29,018
- Hey, pay up!
- This'll do.

824
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:31,398
It's used!

825
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:33,855
You do this to me every time!

826
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:50,694
Kill 'em all!

827
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,136
Attack!

828
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,527
Wait!

829
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:48,208
Amamiya...
you're alone, aren't you?

830
01:20:51,702 --> 01:20:54,945
I'm here to avenge my brother.

831
01:23:59,002 --> 01:24:01,926
Doctor! Doctor!

832
01:24:32,009 --> 01:24:35,430
The battle over the
New Life Market is finished.

833
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:42,104
Doctor.

834
01:24:43,905 --> 01:24:46,341
Please lie on your side.

835
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:52,096
We're going to conduct
a lumbar puncture. Please hold still.

836
01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:17,395
<i>Mommy!</i>

837
01:25:19,059 --> 01:25:20,896
Haruko!

838
01:25:22,907 --> 01:25:24,837
Are you Mr. Choi's wife?

839
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:26,823
There's not much time,
please come in.

840
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,414
Maki.

841
01:25:43,614 --> 01:25:46,805
I'm sorry I couldn't get here faster.

842
01:25:47,586 --> 01:25:49,784
Doctor!

843
01:25:51,859 --> 01:25:58,364
Dr. Amamiya, we're married.

844
01:26:02,864 --> 01:26:04,975
You left me,

845
01:26:05,176 --> 01:26:08,801
and Choi was betrayed by
his friends.

846
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,457
We treated him at Michiyo's bar.

847
01:26:14,712 --> 01:26:19,977
You asked me to take care of him.

848
01:26:21,519 --> 01:26:24,416
We were both hurt.

849
01:26:24,615 --> 01:26:27,721
We took care of each other.

850
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:32,131
We were an ordinary couple.

851
01:26:36,585 --> 01:26:39,074
We had a child.

852
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:43,129
She's a darling child.

853
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,002
We're happy!

854
01:26:51,726 --> 01:26:55,074
Doctor, please save my husband!

855
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:57,292
Save his life!

856
01:26:57,493 --> 01:27:00,358
It's all right, Maki...

857
01:27:01,936 --> 01:27:05,171
I won't die that easily.

858
01:27:05,372 --> 01:27:08,267
I went to the embassy in Tokyo,
so we can go to Korea.

859
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,623
It doesn't matter for me, but I know
you want Haruko to grow up there.

860
01:27:11,823 --> 01:27:13,623
It's your home.

861
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:18,435
Haruko will be able to go to
a Korean school.

862
01:27:18,895 --> 01:27:22,838
Maki, you silly girl...

863
01:27:23,038 --> 01:27:27,182
It doesn't matter where I am,

864
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:30,528
so long as I'm with you two.

865
01:27:31,108 --> 01:27:34,497
Japan, Korea -

866
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:38,421
it doesn't matter.

867
01:27:38,622 --> 01:27:40,587
Darling!

868
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:45,997
Dr. Amamiya,

869
01:27:47,652 --> 01:27:52,609
my life was in your hands
on the front,

870
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,949
at the market,

871
01:27:56,349 --> 01:27:58,576
and again now.

872
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:02,912
Chance encounters are a part of life.

873
01:28:03,448 --> 01:28:05,695
Don't make too much of it.

874
01:28:05,895 --> 01:28:08,916
It was chance that you and Maki met.

875
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:11,731
And that I met you here today.

876
01:28:12,527 --> 01:28:17,333
It was the same for Shunji
and Gye when they died.

877
01:28:19,951 --> 01:28:22,085
If...

878
01:28:24,668 --> 01:28:28,427
Shunji and Gye hadn't died,

879
01:28:29,057 --> 01:28:32,639
they probably would have been lovers.

880
01:28:32,899 --> 01:28:34,728
Doctor.

881
01:28:36,896 --> 01:28:39,197
Take the girl outside.

882
01:28:39,396 --> 01:28:41,851
No, I want her here...

883
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:48,038
to see her brave father's face.

884
01:28:57,014 --> 01:28:59,338
Let's do it.

885
01:28:59,538 --> 01:29:05,579
