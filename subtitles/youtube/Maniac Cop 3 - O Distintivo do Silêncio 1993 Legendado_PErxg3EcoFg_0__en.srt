suspended sentence I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

493
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:02,559
offer mr. Jessup the opportunity to

494
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,720
benefit from standard commercial

495
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,420
exploitation of his story literary

just delete any reference to homicide or

500
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,800
manslaughter from the record those

501
01:00:15,909 --> 01:00:20,769
distinctions would make it difficult for

502
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:23,470
him to benefit from collecting fees or

503
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:24,909
royalties and you can understand how

504
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:29,139
important that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to mr. Jessup</font>
