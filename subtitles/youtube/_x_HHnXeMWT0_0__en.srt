00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,390
<i>Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to read this...</i>

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,797
<i>and you're going to listen,
and you're going to stay on the line.</i>

3
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:43,500
<i>You're not going to interrupt.
You're not going to speak for any reason.</i>

4
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,375
<i>Now, some of this you know.
I'm going to start at the top of the page.</i>

5
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:54,315
<i>Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated.</i>

6
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,388
<i>They were these things.</i>

7
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:59,013
<i>Nothing extreme. Like anyone, they varied.</i>

8
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:03,289
<i>There were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting.</i>

9
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:07,664
<i>And there were days, good days,
when by anyone's judgment...</i>

10
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,367
<i>they would have to be considered clever.</i>

11
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,768
<i>No one would say
that what they were doing was complicated.</i>

12
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:18,442
<i>It wouldn't even be considered new.
Except maybe in the geological sense.</i>

13
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,507
<i>They took from their surroundings
what was needed...</i>

14
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,275
<i>and made of it something more.</i>

15
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:27,012
- We haven't even set up an appointment.
- What order date did you put on this?

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,283
- The 28th. Why?
- I don't know... Yeah, I'm putting 28th.

17
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,656
Have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward?

18
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,762
- Not really.
- Because I was...

19
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,560
I mean I haven't changed my mind
or anything.

20
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,604
Phillip and I were talking,
and we think it could be good. It'd be fun.

21
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,204
Nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.

22
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,371
The time for jacking around with tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,074
Maybe you should try it on your own
in your free time.

24
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,243
My free time? The free time
after the 50 hours a week at work...

25
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:04,345
or after the 30 hours of free time
I already spend in that garage?

26
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,748
And it's not a tesla coil.

27
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,419
I could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet.

28
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:12,224
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

29
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,233
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

30
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,462
Doesn't matter,
we're sticking to the agreement.

31
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,697
Name one thing out of that garage
that's remotely profitable.

32
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:24,139
I don't see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it. Are you?

33
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,906
Abe just means that right now
the JTAG cards are it.

34
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:31,313
When you look at the addresses, we have
a lot of apartments. A lot of residences.

35
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,443
But these are not the bulk orders
to the OEMs or retail giants.

36
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,748
- These are the quiet basement...
- Hackers.

37
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:40,292
Yeah, hacker wannabes
testing their dads' old motherboards.

38
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:45,463
And I know that a lot of that is my fault,
admittedly, you know.

39
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,963
With everything last year, and the doubletalk
we were getting from Platts...

40
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:53,731
- and all the stuff we won't get into now...
- We should get into it.

41
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,097
I'm sorry. What?

42
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,640
Go ahead. Tell him.

43
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,572
We should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.

44
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:06,242
He knows of two other cases like that
at his firm.

45
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,549
- Let Platts know that we're talking about it.
- Look, forget Platts.

46
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,147
This has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market...

47
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:15,488
and what is going to get us VC attention.

48
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,961
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn.

49
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:21,862
And I wasn't 100% sure
of what we were doing...

50
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,265
or even if I didn't agree, maybe.

51
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,632
But if it's my turn...

52
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:31,604
if we're still playing by the rules,
then this is what I want to try.

53
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,145
Here, take it.
They said it wouldn't hold a freeze.

54
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,377
Robert, please. It's not going to hold.

55
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,750
- It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.

56
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,549
- Good night, all.
- See you.

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,890
- We just got done giving this huge speech...
- We gave the speech?

58
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,022
We just got done. It was five minutes ago.

59
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,899
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're
onto us because I suck as the bad cop.

60
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:01,370
- You should do it. You could fake it better.
- I don't know about that.

61
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:04,840
As long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth grade physics...

62
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:08,401
and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.

63
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,540
Phillip and Robert are gung ho on theirs,
and that's fine.

64
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,949
But you know I have no interest in that.

65
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:16,384
I know you have no interest,
besides the fact...

66
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,322
that Phillip and Robert don't even need us.
They just want to use the equipment.

67
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,757
For what I want to do? We don't need them.

68
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,660
Not even Phillip,
because it doesn't need software.

69
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,232
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

70
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,003
- She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
- That's fine.

71
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,739
You know, even if Robert's okay with it,
and he won't be.

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:41,246
- I don't understand what that thing will do.
- We'll let them go at it for two months.

73
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:44,043
- They do theirs, we do ours.
- They said it'd take 14 hours.

74
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,242
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.

75
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,819
We threw the first couple of batches out.
The filter.

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,615
What about crushed?

77
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,548
These guys are funded.

78
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,989
- These guys are... What?
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.

79
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,723
That's what this is.

80
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,163
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

81
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,394
We don't have to play the game
where we're going back and forth...

82
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,439
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process.

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,704
- Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
- This is unmarketable.

84
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,507
By coming at it from the back end,
rather than changing...

85
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,776
the surrounding temperature,
we'll change the level it'll conduct...

86
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,717
the transition temperature.
And by bombarding these edges...

87
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,016
They're dropping the ceramic,
the temperature lower and lower.

88
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:27,923
It makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field.

89
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,757
What I'm saying is
we drop the box down on it.

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,664
Focus our own magnetic field to negate,
knock out with the inverse...

91
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,632
what's going on inside the ceramic.

92
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:40,762
That should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with.

93
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:44,308
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

94
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:48,274
What is that about?
The best mathematician is a lazy one?

95
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,110
- What did you ask for?
- I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

96
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,877
- What did you call it?
- Just come on.

97
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,747
- Are these Type One?
- The superconductors?

98
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,514
Yeah, they're Type One.

99
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,249
Is that going to be a problem?

100
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,225
There's plenty lying around at work,
but they're all bar coded.

101
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,922
- Lf I have to, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

102
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,362
What?

103
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:10,999
- I can get them.
- You can... Are you sure?

104
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,900
I thought you didn't like this idea.

105
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,973
Buy them if you have to.
Everything else we can take care of.

106
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,439
What about the source here?

107
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,066
You know that story
about how NASA spent millions...

108
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,978
developing this pen that writes in zero-G?
Did you ever read that?

109
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:26,517
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

110
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,718
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

111
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,716
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

112
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,486
- Palladium?
- You've got their diagram, what does it say?

113
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,529
They use a ratio of platinum and palladium.

114
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,598
That's not necessary
with the changes I made.

115
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,963
They're just showing off.
If you have it, use it.

116
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,534
I want to get a replacement router.

117
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,730
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- Did Robert look at it?

118
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,601
- I already got his.
- I can't fix it.

119
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,371
- Okay. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's $50.

120
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,373
- Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,711
Wait, platinum or palladium
is less resistant?

122
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,876
- Abe? It's not a...
- Yeah, I don't care.

123
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,476
- So resistance doesn't matter.
- I need an aye or a yes.

124
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,612
- Did you jiggle the...
- The collet nut?

125
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,454
- Robert did it.
- Well, yes. I guess.

126
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,395
- Well, then, which is cheaper?
- You're not going to buy it, are you?

127
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,864
Well, unless you've got
a few grams of palladium lying around.

128
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,131
Why would they put it in there
if you didn't need it?

129
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,296
One catalytic converter. It's fine.

130
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,067
Remember to put it back.
Your emission just went up 300%.

131
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,075
- Is there enough in here?
- Yeah, should be.

132
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:29,045
If not, we'll pull the one out of my truck.
Okay, copper tubing.

133
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,820
- This will be out of commission, right?
- Without the tubing?

134
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,990
- We can use the Freon, too.
- No, it's going to be room temperature.

135
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,153
I know, just in case.

136
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,290
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the tubing.
This isn't saving us money.

137
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,268
- Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
- Good.

138
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,093
Should we be wearing goggles?

139
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,665
- Should we be wearing goggles?
- What?

140
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,036
Goggles. Should we be wearing goggles?

141
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,783
Wait. Phillip, you don't want
to come out here.

142
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,080
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?

143
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,395
It is, though, right? It's not just me?

144
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:29,126
No, it's definitely smaller, but it just seems
that way. Take what they have.

145
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,269
Minus the coolant which we don't need.

146
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,865
The rest of it is the mercury bath...

147
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:39,240
which you would know better than I do,
but they're probably just showing off.

148
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:44,144
I mean, you have it, you got to use it, right?

149
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,451
- What? Does it hurt?
- No, I didn't feel anything.

150
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,850
That sound is just weirding me out.

151
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,552
- What does it feel like?
- I don't know.

152
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,823
I don't know if I'm making it up.

153
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,294
Here.

154
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,447
- Next part. Let's do the next part.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,793
Isn't there some sort of glass
or a transparent...

156
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,455
Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?

157
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,192
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay, drop it.

158
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,360
I don't know of anything
that won't leave a gap in the field.

159
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,461
But we got to see what's going on in there.

160
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,235
- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,872
- What?
- You want to put my camcorder...

162
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,506
inside the box that's so dangerous
we can't look into it.

163
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:56,818
If something happens,
would you pay me back?

164
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,716
So we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box.

165
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,859
So we're ready for the argon.

166
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:08,158
- Which one is that?
- It's the blue one.

167
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,034
I weighed it at 77 grams.

168
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,401
I set the scale to decagrams, though.

169
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,398
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.

170
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,274
Ready for...

171
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:26,182
0.05 liters of argon.

172
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,261
- You ready?
- Just the plate first, right?

173
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,264
Right, first just the plate, and then we'll...

174
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,601
Let's just give it a second.

175
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,050
- You want to do the box now?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,889
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.

177
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:14,692
Let's make sure everything's set up right.
Hold on, Aaron. Wait.

178
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,902
Just wait.

179
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,512
Okay.

180
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:41,390
Anything?

181
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,790
- Is this normal?
- I don't know.

182
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,123
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait! No.

183
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,971
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- Did we blow something?

184
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,070
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.

185
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,408
- You want to check your camera?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,783
- Let's get this.
- You ready?

187
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,215
One, two, three.

188
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,994
<i>Hey. Tell me you're hungry.
Kara's at her mom's and I'm starving.</i>

189
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,529
Yeah, I'm hungry. What...

190
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,803
<i>Abe, it's 7:00. Abe, it's 7:00 at night.</i>

191
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:34,308
<i>- Okay, yeah, I have food...
- Okay.</i>

192
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,779
<i>- Wait, are those kids there?
- Just a sec.</i>

193
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,250
Yeah, they're here.

194
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:44,117
<i>Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.
I just pulled in, so come on down.</i>

195
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:47,282
Come up first. I have some stuff
I want to take back to the shop.

196
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,519
<i>All right, but meet me at the door.</i>

197
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,791
<i>- Okay, all right.
- Seriously, meet me at the door.</i>

198
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,831
Okay. All right. See you.

199
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,313
- What's up, Abe?
- Hey, Brad. How are you?

200
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:12,641
Good.

201
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:25,692
- How long did he say he would be there?
- Not long.

202
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,823
If he's got problems, he's got to fix them.
You're not his dad.

203
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,562
I know. I just thought it would be good
to do something charitable.

204
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,469
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.

205
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,508
You feel like a steak? To eat.

206
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,884
I don't want a steak. Let's just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop.

207
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,918
- I have some stuff I want to try out.
- Okay.

208
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,013
We can get some tacos on the way,
or we can get a steak afterwards.

209
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,389
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.

210
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:01,722
It's stable?

211
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,401
Aaron, it's stable?

212
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,041
- What did you do to this thing?
- What?

213
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:20,009
- It looks like a dog digested it.
- Okay, that's the plate.

214
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,551
I rigged this into the box
so I could control the feed.

215
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,750
- I figured it's the easiest way...
- It's just controlling the box.

216
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,692
The plate stays the same.
What you do is you gradually feed it.

217
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,396
Okay. You hear that? How it's...

218
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,836
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.

219
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,500
It's like a feedback loop,
and it just regulates itself.

220
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,375
And what you do is when it gets there,
you bring it back...

221
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:51,804
and there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.

222
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,019
So it works?

223
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,246
- Yeah, it does.
- What is that, like 10%?

224
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:02,721
It knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak.

225
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,853
You may want to come over here
and take a look at this.

226
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,622
Okay, what am I looking at?

227
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:11,031
- What are we pulling out of the batteries?
- Probably 24 volts.

228
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,501
- I mean, no more than that, right?
- Okay.

229
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,300
So your meter's jacked up.

230
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,573
That's what I figured. So I tried three others.
I got the exact same thing.

231
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,509
- I spent all last night...
- What was it?

232
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,344
I spent last night and a two-hour break
just double-checking everything.

233
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,444
There's something wrong here. We're not
pulling out more than we're putting in.

234
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,784
- Slightly more.
- Well, yeah, whatever.

235
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,790
It's not like a volt and a half
more than we're putting in.

236
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,851
It's probably the batteries.
They're cheap batteries, not regulated right.

237
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:40,655
That is weird, though.

238
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,062
You want to see something weirder?

239
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:50,240
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

240
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,204
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just for fun.

241
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,404
Twelve volts.

242
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,921
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

243
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,696
So, what the hell is this thing?

244
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,877
It doesn't stay like that.

245
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:29,545
No, it winds down in a few minutes.
What does that?

246
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,546
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.

247
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,022
It should just be a day or two, anyways.

248
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:45,419
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, they have their work in there, too.

249
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,693
If Phillip finds out about that
he's going to have to take it apart.

250
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,203
- No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
- Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

251
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,241
Abe, it's my garage, okay?
It's not like they're paying rent.

252
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:01,838
<i>There was value in the thing.
Clearly. Of that they were certain of.</i>

253
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,278
<i>But what is the application?
In a matter of hours...</i>

254
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,875
<i>they had pinned it to everything
from mass transit to satellite launching.</i>

255
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,181
<i>Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets.</i>

256
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:13,348
<i>Everything would be cheaper.
It was practical and they knew it.</i>

257
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,518
<i>But above all that, beyond the positives...</i>

258
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,788
<i>they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited...</i>

259
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,159
<i>is to sell something
they did not yet understand.</i>

260
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,723
<i>So they kept quiet.
The parties would continue.</i>

261
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,395
<i>Any birthday, anniversary, holiday...</i>

262
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,441
<i>maybe some obscure project launch.
It didn't matter. Any reason would do.</i>

263
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:35,011
<i>What was important is that Thomas Granger,
their last best hope of funding, show up.</i>

264
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,482
<i>If he left a little earlier than
they would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.</i>

265
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,611
<i>He was only there
to please his daughter Rachel.</i>

266
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,280
<i>And she was only there to please Abe.</i>

267
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,785
What did you say
to Mr. Granger a while ago?

268
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:52,658
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr. Granger.

269
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,924
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.

270
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:57,933
- Go ahead.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

271
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,731
- He thinks we're kids.
- Lf you call him Mr. Granger...

272
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,572
he looks at you like you're a 6-year-old kid.
He does it with me. It won't work anymore.

273
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,473
<i>Abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device.</i>

274
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,315
<i>But as weeks became months...</i>

275
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:17,717
<i>their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth.</i>

276
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,864
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

277
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,994
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

278
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:08,239
I'm not there.

279
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,601
Really?

280
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:15,547
- March Madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

281
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,773
- Who's up?
- I don't even know what.

282
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,411
Do you have anything important
at work today?

283
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,455
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

284
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,259
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

285
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,331
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

286
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,058
But how about this instead?

287
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:39,365
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

288
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,201
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

289
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,969
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

290
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,469
Well, it looks like mustard to me.

291
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,913
I know, but it's a film. It's a protein...

292
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,918
<i>secreted by a fungus
called Aspergillus Ticor.</i>

293
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,043
He told you that?

294
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:59,123
No, he knew it was a protein
but didn't know where it came from.

295
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:02,386
All he really did was just take some pictures
with their equipment.

296
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:03,824
Guess where we're going.

297
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,295
- Do you know where Will is?
- No, why?

298
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,730
The Ariel meeting
is pushed back till Wednesday.

299
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,597
I thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?

300
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,932
What do they do with engineers
when they turn 40?

301
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,439
- What, Bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

302
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,442
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out.

303
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,774
- Okay. Thanks.
- Can you meet me out front?

304
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,974
- You got to drive.
- Okay, here. Take my keys.

305
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:29,281
Okay, if you can, just pretend
that this is the first time I came in.

306
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,913
And if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me...

307
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,125
- Okay, so what is it?
- Protein build up.

308
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,857
- Okay, can you just tell him?
- Protein build up.

309
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:44,129
- But what kind?
- Some fungus.

310
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,166
- Some fungus.
- Where did it come from?

311
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:51,206
- I don't know. You were to take it to the lab.
- Yeah, that's next.

312
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,073
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

313
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,003
How did you get over here?

314
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,310
Do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40?

315
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,244
They take them out and shoot them.

316
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,322
What the hell, Abe?
You could have just shown me the pictures.

317
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,086
- I want you to believe it.
- Believe what, the protein?

318
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,988
- I believe you.
- Okay, look...

319
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,530
this guy already thinks it's a joke,
so he may be a little defensive.

320
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,964
<i>Really? Why would he think that?</i>

321
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,113
Please.

322
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,949
<i>Aspergillus Ticor.</i>

323
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,680
This is a fungus that's everywhere.

324
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:41,622
It's in our bed, our skin,
sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.

325
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:47,029
It's basically the reason you don't leave
things in dark, damp, closed-off places.

326
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,962
Thank you.
Do you have that sample I brought?

327
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,231
There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.

328
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:02,538
Okay, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

329
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:08,413
- You thought it was a joke, right?
- It is a joke.

330
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,346
Right, but how did you know?

331
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,791
Will you show him? Please?

332
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:29,339
<i>This is how I get protein A
out of Aspergillus Ticor. We sweeten it.</i>

333
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,274
We agitate it. We spin it around.
We sweeten some more.

334
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:35,607
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

335
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,240
To get the same amount I brought in.

336
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,750
So if it's an incubator for fungus,
is that valuable?

337
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,649
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

338
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:46,120
There's another way to secrete
that much protein. Do it naturally.

339
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:48,453
But that takes a lot longer.

340
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:53,529
If it has a little moisture and it's left alone,
it'll start secreting and it'll build up...

341
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,032
- and build up, but it takes a long time.
- How long?

342
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,999
- A long time.
- More than a few days? Then how long?

343
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,367
To get the same amount of protein
that we have...

344
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,770
the amount that I was wiping off
every five days...

345
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,069
and five days later it would accumulate...

346
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,840
he says it would take about five to six years.

347
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,239
I don't want to belittle this guy.

348
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,047
So, I said screw it
and I put my watch in there.

349
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,714
- And?
- I want you to do it.

350
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:22,257
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

351
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:27,855
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

352
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,601
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

353
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,535
We thought
that we were degrading gravity, right?

354
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,632
That we were blocking that information.

355
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:42,371
I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.

356
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,611
When you were controlling the feed,
did you notice it was parabolic?

357
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,150
It's important. Parabolas are important.
Here, look at this.

358
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:52,655
I don't know, Abe.

359
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,384
I'm going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds...

360
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,757
with nothing in it. It's empty this time.

361
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,852
That's 22...

362
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,693
In all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy.

363
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,326
In all Feynman diagrams what's the
one variable that you can turn negative...

364
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,904
and still get rational answers for?
It's not mass.

365
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,804
Twenty-two hours, 27 minutes in the box.

366
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,208
- It's an odd number.
- That's 1,347 minutes.

367
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:19,441
- 1,347, man, you got that fast.
- How did you know it's odd?

368
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,611
Because this is it. This is what's going on.
There's an "A" end and a "B" end.

369
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,691
Let's say the A end is 12:00,and the B end is 12:01.

370
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,692
All right? We start the machine
with the Weeble at the A end.

371
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,228
- It travels forward...
- You got to write this down.

372
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:34,763
- There's nothing to write down.
- I'll write it down.

373
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,924
It travels forward normally
towards the B end.

374
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,469
When it gets there,
the feed runs down parabolically...

375
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,698
until it should stop, but it curves
back around towards the A end.

376
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,970
When it gets back to the A end...
Curve that around. The Weeble...

377
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:49,410
has experienced a total of two minutes,
and again it curves...

378
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,640
- Back around. It curves parabolically.
- Right.

379
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,377
It comes back around
and it does this about 1,300 times.

380
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,215
When it finally exits on the B end...

381
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,153
it's travelled an odd number
of forward and backward trips.

382
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,692
What is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

383
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,853
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

384
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:08,762
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.

385
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,392
Every time it hits the B end
there's a chance...

386
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:14,403
a small chance it won't
curve back around towards the A end.

387
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:18,202
And for some reason, it takes
about 1,300 trips before it finally does.

388
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,608
It does have to exit, or else
we wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.

389
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:23,703
Okay, let's take a look at this.

390
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,680
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.

391
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,884
- 1,334 minutes.
- Even.

392
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,990
Enter at the B end.

393
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:41,693
Exit at the B end.

394
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:48,104
- I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
- I am trying, okay?

395
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:50,673
Everything we're putting in that box
comes ungrounded.

396
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,538
And I don't mean grounded to the earth,
I mean not tethered.

397
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,807
We're blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

398
00:26:56,914 --> 00:27:00,042
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

399
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,144
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole
matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.

400
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,348
This is not mechanics and heat.

401
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,222
- We can publish.
- Yeah, we can publish.

402
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,823
No, I mean we can really publish.

403
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,001
Aaron, the Weeble's stupid. It can't move.

404
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,699
Even if we were
to put the Weeble in at point B...

405
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,506
it's still going to bounce back and forth
until it's kicked out at the B end.

406
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,673
But if it were smart...

407
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,717
it could enter at the B end
and exit at the A end before it flips back.

408
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:46,857
You're talking about making a bigger one.

409
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:51,499
I didn't say anything.
You're the one talking about it.

410
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,528
So, you believe me?

411
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:57,869
No, I don't.

412
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,408
Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.

413
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,916
- We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

414
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:13,789
We need a box big enough for a person
to fit into. As far as turning it on...

415
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:17,056
I was testing the box. It turns out
over half the rings are redundant.

416
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,620
The inner ring is strong enough on its own,
so it makes the plate smaller.

417
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:22,825
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do...

418
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:27,233
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them.

419
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,768
How small?

420
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:34,068
It should be accumulative so a lot of
mini-fields equal one big one, right?

421
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:36,747
Yeah, sum of series, that makes sense.

422
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:40,283
What I was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it...

423
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,250
and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.

424
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,446
We could just lock it in a closet.

425
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:48,586
Someplace where someone's not going to
go poking around and messing with it.

426
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,354
And climate-controlled.

427
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:53,394
Yeah, so whatever, we'll find some place.

428
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,700
So, if we go your route with what?
A bunch of mini-fields?

429
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,531
That's a lot of work. We'd have to...
I mean, how many days is that?

430
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:05,169
Abe, you know what we could use?

431
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,612
I know we've seen
a lot of crazy things lately, okay?

432
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:13,649
I know you're still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense.

433
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,346
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, okay?

434
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:20,218
I wouldn't do that to you
and I'm not doing that to you.

435
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,728
So when you see this, you can't yell
or make any noise or run anywhere.

436
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,322
I know you probably feel like you're
being tricked or made fun of. But you're not.

437
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:32,300
I promise you, you're not. Okay?

438
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,060
Who was that, Abe?

439
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,153
Let's just wait. Six minutes.

440
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,180
Look, you sure you're okay to drive?

441
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,452
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

442
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,429
I spent the day in a hotel room
in Russellfield.

443
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,500
- I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- I wonder what I did.

444
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:52,566
- I guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

445
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,610
Probably just worked, I guess.

446
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,678
Yeah, probably so.

447
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,511
Look, now that I know about this, Abe...

448
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,956
don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.

449
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,120
Go ahead.

450
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,170
Hey, Rachel.

451
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,174
Why not the lottery?

452
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:08,279
We can if you want,
but it's not until Saturday.

453
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:12,913
And even if we win the full $10 million,
that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.

454
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,758
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple days like this.

455
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,262
- I was just running a test. In and out.
- I want to do what you did.

456
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,763
Exactly what you did.

457
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:24,767
<i>- The first thing I did is call in sick.
- Okay, I did that.</i>

458
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:28,736
<i>- Then I drove to the storage facility.
- But I need to drop Lauren at school first.</i>

459
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,433
<i>Then meet me there.
We're going to need both cars.</i>

460
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,635
<i>We need to park yours down the road,
out of sight of the facility.</i>

461
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,647
<i>- Why are we doing that?
- Because we need a ride home.</i>

462
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,307
<i>- What is that...
- It'll make sense.</i>

463
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,611
<i>Okay, I'll be patient.</i>

464
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,211
<i>When I got to the storage room,
I flooded the box with argon...</i>

465
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,054
<i>and I had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks.</i>

466
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,052
<i>- There's leaks?
- There's always leaks.</i>

467
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,496
<i>At 8:30 a. m., I set the timer for 15 minutes...</i>

468
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:04,006
<i>I jumped in the car,
and drove to Russellfield.</i>

469
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,368
<i>Okay, I lost it.</i>

470
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,137
<i>- What?
- Why the timer?</i>

471
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,380
<i>Because the moment we start those
machines is the moment we'll end up...</i>

472
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,213
<i>- getting out of them, and...
- Right. Got it. Sorry.</i>

473
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:18,014
<i>I don't want to be standing around
when they do.</i>

474
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:23,459
<i>While I was on the road at 8:45,
the machine kicked on by itself...</i>

475
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:27,623
<i>and by 8:49, it was completely warmed up.</i>

476
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:40,001
<i>In Russellfield, I got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself.</i>

477
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,473
<i>Wait, what do you mean "isolate"?</i>

478
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,275
<i>I closed the windows,
I unplugged everything in the room...</i>

479
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:47,350
<i>the telephone, TV, clock, radio, everything.</i>

480
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,444
<i>I didn't want to take the chance
of running into someone I knew...</i>

481
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:52,522
<i>or seeing something on the news
that might...</i>

482
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:56,525
<i>If we're dealing with causality,
and I don't even know for sure.</i>

483
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,822
<i>- I just...
- What?</i>

484
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,393
<i>- Took myself out of the equation.
- Err on the side of caution.</i>

485
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,592
<i>Yes.</i>

486
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>Then what did you do all day?</i>

487
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:13,971
<i>- I just sat there. I had some books, but...
- What? Were you nervous?</i>

488
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:17,206
<i>Yeah.
It's mind-numbing, all the second-guessing.</i>

489
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,585
"Evacipate. "

490
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,253
<i>At 3:30 p. m.,
I stopped by Williams Medical Supply.</i>

491
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:34,455
<i>Picked up a Class E oxygen tank and mask.</i>

492
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,228
<i>I called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their mid-cap fund...</i>

493
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,235
<i>had the greatest percentage gain that day.</i>

494
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,307
<i>The idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade.</i>

495
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,103
<i>Can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement?</i>

496
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,646
<i>But if we do that, I want to use the library
in Russellfield, use their computers.</i>

497
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:08,859
<i>So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15
and cut off the power to the box.</i>

498
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:12,634
<i>It cycled down to a tolerable level
at about 3:19.</i>

499
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,862
<i>The trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level...</i>

500
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:19,271
<i>but before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.</i>

501
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,377
<i>So, does it hurt?</i>

502
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,508
<i>Yeah, it does a little.</i>

503
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:28,510
<i>It's not bad if you wait for the right time.
It's like a small static shock.</i>

504
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,179
<i>- Once you're in, you're fine, though.
- What?</i>

505
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:34,719
<i>I know you've done it,
and I can only assume that you don't have...</i>

506
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,792
<i>cancer or male impotence.</i>

507
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:39,589
<i>But what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is?</i>

508
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,063
<i>I can imagine no way
in which this thing would be...</i>

509
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,293
<i>considered anywhere remotely close to safe.</i>

510
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,894
<i>All I know is I spent six hours in there
and I'm still alive.</i>

511
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,407
<i>You still want to do it?</i>

512
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,091
<i>I set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours.</i>

513
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:16,291
<i>I regulated the O2 tank,
took some Dramamine, and tried to sleep.</i>

514
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:18,230
<i>Did you?</i>

515
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,402
<i>- What?
- Did you sleep?</i>

516
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,841
<i>Not at first. I've never
considered myself claustrophobic...</i>

517
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:29,072
<i>but I started sweating and I couldn't find
the right flow rate on the tank...</i>

518
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,608
<i>and I was breathing differently than I was
when I was testing it on the outside.</i>

519
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:36,117
<i>Eventually, I settled down, and...</i>

520
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:40,445
<i>I don't know, maybe it was the Dramamine
kicking in, but I remember this moment...</i>

521
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:43,355
<i>in the dark
with the reverberation of the machine.</i>

522
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,896
<i>It was maybe the most content
I've ever been.</i>

523
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,000
<i>I woke up on my own without the alarm...</i>

524
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,595
<i>and waited for the machine to cool down.
Cool down from my perspective.</i>

525
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,573
<i>It got to a point where it sounded safe
to get out...</i>

526
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:01,235
<i>but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes...</i>

527
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,710
<i>so I trusted the math and waited.</i>

528
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,581
That's not a static shock, Abe.
Okay, please stop it.

529
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,588
You got out too soon.

530
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,057
You have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough.

531
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,163
So, we're back here?

532
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,164
Yeah, we're here.
It's 8:50, Tuesday morning.

533
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,336
All right. Give me a few minutes.

534
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,943
<i>From there it was easy.
The bulk of the work was done.</i>

535
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:19,385
<i>I just left everything the way I found it.
I left the machine alone...</i>

536
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,458
<i>and didn't turn it off,
and just cleared out of there.</i>

537
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,996
<i>So your double would find everything
the same later that day and get in the box?</i>

538
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:31,625
<i>Right, but also, I or my double or someone
was in the box coming backwards.</i>

539
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:34,967
<i>So who knows what that would've done
if I'd turned the machine off.</i>

540
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,563
<i>Definitely. So, they're one-time use only.</i>

541
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:42,077
<i>So then, at that moment, since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car...</i>

542
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:46,206
<i>I had to take a taxi home. But when we go,
we'll be able to use your truck.</i>

543
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,233
- You have a margin account, right?
- Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?

544
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,242
Good. Today, before 12:30, we'll buy
as many shares as we can of RGWU.

545
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:20,010
<i>They'll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus...</i>

546
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:23,109
<i>and the stock will nearly double
in afternoon trading.</i>

547
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,148
- What do they do?
- What do you mean?

548
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,555
What does this company do?
Do they make things or...

549
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:32,253
I don't know.
All that matters is the price goes up.

550
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:37,061
<i>The volume is so high that the number
of shares we trade won't affect the price.</i>

551
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,931
You really don't know what they do?

552
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:51,311
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund,
so volume is high enough to hide us.

553
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:53,507
- Do you think it's too cautious?
- I don't know.

554
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,812
I know there's a lot of other stocks
out there...

555
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,117
that do a lot more than double,
but this is my first day.

556
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,591
<i>- My God.
- She's not going to answer.</i>

557
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,457
I know, Abe. That's the question.

558
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,592
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion...

559
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:49,297
you've gone the charity route,
you have this perfect 100-room mansion...

560
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,771
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads.

561
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,845
Basically, you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want...

562
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:55,934
nobody can touch you.

563
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,105
- You're back from a two-year...
- Above the law.

564
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:03,084
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back
from this two-year world-galloping vacation.

565
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:05,246
How do you fill your day? What do you do?

566
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,690
Abe, I know that's the question, but it's not
a real question, so why does it matter?

567
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,192
So what's the answer?

568
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,128
Babe, he knows that's the question, okay?
He's asking you the question.

569
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:19,094
What do you mean? What would I do
with my life or what would I do tomorrow?

570
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:20,465
My God, either.

571
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,164
I'd have to do something constructive.
I'd have to do something that would help...

572
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,940
- something that would make me feel good.
- I know. That's fantastic. Good.

573
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:34,916
- My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
- Shut up. Why did you ask, then?

574
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:39,349
This is what I would do:
I would wake up tomorrow morning...

575
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,890
and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc...

576
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,758
and I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist
that I'm there to see him...

577
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:47,557
and when he comes out...

578
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:51,898
I would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose.

579
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:56,862
Just one good punch, one good pow.

580
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,606
- That's amazing. It's about time.
- That is so great.

581
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:04,407
Where did this come from?
You're always defending the guy.

582
00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:07,074
- It's unnatural.
- I'd only do it if I knew that...

583
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,913
no one would find out or get hurt.

584
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:12,385
Like, I wish that there was a way
that I could do it...

585
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,320
and then I go back and tell myself not to.

586
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,519
Because I just want to know
what it feels like. That's all, really.

587
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:18,822
I'm so proud.

588
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:22,722
Finally, my husband, the hero.

589
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:32,170
- We can't do that.
- I know.

590
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,238
Did you call pest control?

591
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,878
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there, do you?

592
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:43,010
- They don't sound like birds.
- She thinks there are rats in the attic.

593
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,012
<i>But the idea had been spoken...</i>

594
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,251
<i>and the words wouldn't go back
after they had been uttered aloud.</i>

595
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,952
So you are understanding this, right?

596
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,586
You don't have to sell me
on not doing this, okay?

597
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,722
- I don't think I told you...
- Even if you do stop yourself...

598
00:43:56,833 --> 00:44:00,394
your double, from hitting Platts,
why would he, your double, get in the box?

599
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:03,961
<i>And with no need for it,
no possible real-world application...</i>

600
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:07,731
<i>no advantage at all to be gained from it,
the idea stayed.</i>

601
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:11,836
- How would you do it?
- I wouldn't.

602
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,773
- Just for fun.
- I still wouldn't.

603
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,718
- But what if there was a way to...
- Look, Abe, look.

604
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,316
I'm not going to pretend
like I know anything about paradoxes...

605
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,826
or what follows them, and honestly,
I really don't believe in that crap.

606
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:28,728
Kill your mom before you were born,
whatever. It has to work itself out somehow.

607
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:30,958
- I don't know.
- This is what I know for sure.

608
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:35,129
The worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing...

609
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,036
has already been defined,
that this is the second...

610
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:42,043
or third time through, or whatever.
And do you ever feel like...

611
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:46,878
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray...

612
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:51,148
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this.

613
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,483
People are always blaming their parents...

614
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,889
as if, if their mom had breastfed them,
their lives would be different.

615
00:44:57,994 --> 00:44:59,154
Bunch of whiners.

616
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:02,425
Yeah, they are. But what if it wasn't
something you wonder about?

617
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:05,525
What if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be?

618
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:09,766
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

619
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,773
I'm not, either. But what's worse?

620
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,969
Thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

621
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,648
You don't have to look at me like that.
I'm okay.

622
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,625
No, I just assumed that you would.
I trust her.

623
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,530
- I know that when I decided to tell you...
- Decided to tell?

624
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,735
I knew that you are married and that there's
no secrets. Anything I tell you, she'll know.

625
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:43,362
- It's not a matter of trust.
- I know.

626
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,102
It's just how much better will it be
if in a few days...

627
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,668
I surprise her and we all just fly
to Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?

628
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,307
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping...

629
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:56,317
For now, you can tell her
you had a good day in the market.

630
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,478
- You don't understand.
- No.

631
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,056
You don't understand the questions
that come with that.

632
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,682
But we'll explain it to her,
and we'll take some time...

633
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,987
to figure out what's next...

634
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,655
which, I think, should be building
a bigger box, like the size of a room...

635
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,596
where more than one person could fit in.

636
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:12,827
Safe or not,
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.

637
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,333
By the way, this is our guy.

638
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,206
- What's the volume?
- Five-and-a-half.

639
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,439
What's the return? Holy...

640
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:30,548
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess
I was just talking about Robert and Phillip.

641
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:31,847
I don't want to tell them.

642
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,219
I know they have a lot invested
in the group...

643
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,688
I don't want to tell them.

644
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,024
If you need me to take the guilt on this one,
fine, okay?

645
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:40,891
I accept it gladly. It's mine.

646
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,659
At the end of this week,
they can have whatever they want.

647
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:47,031
I'll turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years.

648
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,503
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

649
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,473
They can have my truck
if that makes you feel better.

650
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,670
But I am not telling them a thing
about this. We're not.

651
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,690
God, everything is so different in there.

652
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:14,855
You can feel how cut off you are.

653
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,168
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

654
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,726
And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?

655
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,238
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside...

656
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,869
- I had this dream in there.
- About what?

657
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:35,411
I was on or near the ocean,
and I just kept hearing the surf.

658
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:37,408
It was so uneventful.

659
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,191
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.

660
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,735
Come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?

661
00:47:57,306 --> 00:47:59,103
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

662
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,766
- Turn around.
- You see it?

663
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,278
Where is it coming from? It's your notebook.

664
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,474
- It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
- What is this?

665
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,115
- Your ear's bleeding. Man.
- Give me that. I got it.

666
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,659
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

667
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,827
For people.
You think it's the machine? I got it.

668
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,941
Great. I can actually
get some work done today.

669
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,415
Hi, guys, what's going on?

670
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:45,351
I always seem to get a lot more done
when I'm not locked out.

671
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:46,887
He says they had to spray again.

672
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:49,958
But he can't tell us about it in advance.
Is Hero even here?

673
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,391
You never see anything around here
but those geckos.

674
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,123
- I know.
- I think it's for the geckos.

675
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,596
- What?
- Why?

676
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,997
- Hey, man, thanks for the present.
- How is that working out for you?

677
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:02,833
You know what? You guys, both of you,
you make fun, but there is a difference.

678
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,202
Wait. What did you call him?

679
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:06,367
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

680
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,943
- He didn't tell you about it?
- No.

681
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:12,175
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.

682
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,715
- What?
- Swear to God.

683
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,614
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.

684
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,085
- Filby!
- You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.

685
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,487
It's funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it.

686
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,058
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- You didn't.

687
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,561
You can't risk your life and
especially the welfare of Kara and Lauren...

688
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,688
for someone like Rachel.

689
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:30,858
She practically begs
for this to happen to her.

690
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,559
I figured at least you'd understand.

691
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:34,636
Understand what?
You've never been like this.

692
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:38,434
That's what I mean.
You see how different things are now.

693
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:41,269
Different? How are things different?

694
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,879
You see it, okay? I know you do.

695
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:49,279
Look, that was the night...

696
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,978
you had told me everything
about the machine.

697
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:55,786
Everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when I saw this guy...

698
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:58,451
I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.

699
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,326
I wasn't going
to let him scare people like that.

700
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:03,664
I know it was stupid, okay?

701
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,303
But I mean, this whole idea,
this whole thing that we're doing.

702
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:12,432
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

703
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:16,068
If it was just you, you had to worry about,
I'd still think you're stupid.

704
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,046
But you have a family now,
and God, especially now...

705
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:20,980
anything like this would be crazy.

706
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:24,076
- I know, okay.
- I know you know that, but you've got to...

707
00:50:24,186 --> 00:50:27,212
- I know, okay?
- Filby!

708
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:33,351
You little sack of...
Even if you see him, don't tell me.

709
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:37,092
It's not my fault if I don't know,
and I just hope the thing runs away.

710
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:38,928
Then what are we doing out here?

711
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,869
She worries about the cat.
So you look for the cat. It's what you do.

712
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,783
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

713
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,184
It's embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together...

714
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,481
but he never sees us leave.

715
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:02,056
Yeah, but what do you think
the receptionist thinks...

716
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,651
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day?

717
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,566
Did you unplug this?

718
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,565
You brought your cell phone?

719
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,065
Can I check the caller ID?

720
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,875
Yeah, we're not back.

721
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,882
Yeah, but you can't take it back
with you, okay?

722
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,820
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.

723
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,923
I'm not there. I had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys' hands.

724
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,224
Tell me.

725
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:45,663
That sounds good.
No, I've got to eat with these offsite fags.

726
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:48,066
Save mine, though. I'll have it later.

727
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:53,097
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.

728
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:57,873
- What?
- What?

729
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,908
We're supposed to win this by two,
they just turned over with 12 on the clock.

730
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,880
- We have to foul.
- No.

731
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:09,945
What? No, we foul here,
they miss the first free throw...

732
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:12,213
- and they come back with the three.
- Three points.

733
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,516
That's right.

734
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:23,127
Man, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.

735
00:53:26,735 --> 00:53:28,168
What's up, you guys?

736
00:53:35,744 --> 00:53:39,112
- You have got to be kidding.
- I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.

737
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,876
- It's Kara?
- Yeah.

738
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:45,911
How do cell phones work?

739
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,889
If there's two duplicate phones
and I call the same number...

740
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,256
do they both ring at the same time,
or is there...

741
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,521
- That's not how they work.
- It's a radio signal.

742
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,892
No, it's a network.

743
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,057
It checks each area and
when it finds the phone, it stops ringing.

744
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,760
It rings the first one.

745
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:04,969
- This one is ringing.
- Right.

746
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:07,372
So the one your double has in Russellfield
can't be.

747
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:09,536
Right. I think we broke symmetry.

748
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,112
- Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
- No.

749
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:17,514
You feel all right?

750
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,481
- I feel fine. Do you?
- Yeah.

751
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,813
Is Kara asleep? Did I wake you up?

752
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,856
Yeah. No, not me, it felt more like a nap.

753
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,791
I think my body's getting used to
these 36-hour days. What's going on?

754
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,160
We can do this, but we have to do it now.

755
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:05,028
- Do you have his home address?
- Why now?

756
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,332
We were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow, right? Just like today?

757
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:09,666
Yeah, for stocks.

758
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:14,210
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was asleep.
This car alarm woke me up.

759
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,075
These kids were down skating by,
hitting cars on the block.

760
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:21,138
So we go right now, do our business
at Platts', get back in the box...

761
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,776
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms.

762
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:27,846
All we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight. That should scare them off.

763
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:29,924
That way my double
sleeps through the night...

764
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:34,485
they don't have this conversation,
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual.

765
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,865
- They'll be changed. But...
- Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.

766
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,938
Wait, how do we go back that far
if the machines haven't been running?

767
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,644
- Have they been running?
- Yeah.

768
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,239
I started going by at 5:00,and turning them on, 5:00 p. m.

769
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,180
I got tired of the whole
unanswerable question...

770
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:01,280
Are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me?

771
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,052
- A little of both.
- 5:00.

772
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:07,925
If we get this done by 3:00,
that's 10 hours in the box.

773
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,124
I've got the O2 tanks in the car.

774
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:29,444
- Is that...
- Is that Rachel's car?

775
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,548
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her dad's.
They have the same kind.

776
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,122
Did you see that?

777
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,554
That's Mr. Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.

778
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:41,987
What?

779
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,796
I swear that was him.
What the hell is he doing...

780
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,733
sitting outside my house
at 2:00 in the morning?

781
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,306
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?

782
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,070
- What are you doing?
- Let's just see what he wants.

783
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:58,112
No, let's just get out
of my neighborhood first. Come on.

784
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,648
- Did you see him today?
- No.

785
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,985
I did. I saw him this afternoon...

786
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:06,782
around 6:00.

787
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:09,153
Are you sure you didn't see him
when we drove past?

788
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,385
No, what?

789
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,985
I'm positive this afternoon
he was clean-shaven. I know he was.

790
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,497
He was ready to go to some function
with his wife.

791
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,193
He looks like he's got
a two or three-day growth now.

792
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,430
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not sure, but I think so.

793
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,833
Rachel. This is Abe. Did I wake you up?

794
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,708
Can I get your dad's number
from you real quick?

795
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,411
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

796
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,019
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's he doing?

797
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,722
He's just sitting there.

798
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,894
He got out for a second
and I thought he was coming over...

799
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:52,424
and then he got back in the car.
I think he's drunk.

800
00:57:52,534 --> 00:57:55,128
Hi, sorry to call so late.

801
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,133
May I speak to Thomas Granger, please?

802
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:02,739
Yeah, this is James Miller
from Putney and Myers.

803
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,678
Hi, Mr. Granger?

804
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,539
Thomas Granger?

805
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,190
What are you doing here? Come here!

806
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:31,873
What happened?

807
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,838
I'm okay. I slipped.

808
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:49,214
I want to know what box he used.
You built one for you, right? Just one.

809
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:51,451
Yeah. How many do you think I made?

810
00:58:54,963 --> 00:58:57,831
These are set right. I turned them on at 5:00.

811
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,868
He could have used one
and gone back to 5:00.

812
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,199
He could be in one of them right now.

813
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,239
I say we shut them off
and see if he's in there.

814
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,108
Were you planning on talking to him?

815
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,410
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.

816
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,347
No, I promise you. You know I wouldn't.

817
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:17,680
Are you sure you wouldn't?

818
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:20,721
You're the one he can't get near
without passing out.

819
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,556
There is no way
I would tell anyone about this. No way.

820
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:27,788
- Can you think of any reason you might?
- No.

821
00:59:27,896 --> 00:59:30,730
Sometimes we do things
but don't know how we got to that point.

822
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,300
- No, I can't.
- Can't what?

823
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,235
I can't think of any reason why I would.

824
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:38,201
Well, I can't either.

825
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:41,999
What if it was an emergency?

826
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:46,440
- So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
- No, I don't know. What, so you might then?

827
00:59:47,115 --> 00:59:49,346
I don't know. What kind of emergency?

828
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:52,686
<i>The permutations were endless.</i>

829
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,885
<i>They tried again going to the source...</i>

830
00:59:56,992 --> 00:59:59,722
<i>but even while keeping him separated
from Abe by two rooms...</i>

831
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:00,818
Ask him his name.

832
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:03,659
<i>...Granger's condition
could only be described as vegetative.</i>

833
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,164
What did he say?

834
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,827
<i>From this they deduced
that the problem was recursive...</i>

835
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:11,565
<i>but beyond that, found themselves
admitting, against their own nature...</i>

836
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:14,164
<i>and once again,
that the answer was unknowable.</i>

837
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,972
- What do you think he changed?
- Not much.

838
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,673
We didn't have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he could've done anything.

839
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,775
I know he changed this. I know we weren't
having this conversation the first time...

840
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,182
so you don't know what we lost.

841
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,811
It really could not have been much.

842
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:29,720
It doesn't matter how much.
It just matters that it's changed.

843
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,054
I know what you're saying.

844
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,456
<i>The question should have been...</i>

845
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:34,996
<i>what to do with the comatose man
in the guest bedroom.</i>

846
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:38,795
<i>But in Abe's mind
he was already compiling the list.</i>

847
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,736
<i>Two mg of oral triazolam...</i>

848
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:51,643
<i>every seven hours induces a safe sleep state
and a minimal metabolic rate.</i>

849
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:54,875
<i>At this continued state of rest...</i>

850
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:57,918
<i>the human body breathes
0.3 liters of oxygen a minute...</i>

851
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,546
<i>or roughly 2,000 liters in four days.</i>

852
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:04,590
<i>A Class E oxygen tank holds 625 liters.</i>

853
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:06,792
<i>To maintain hydration...</i>

854
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:11,026
<i>the body cycles through a minimum
of two-and-a-half liters of water per day.</i>

855
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,528
<i>Any food would be a luxury...</i>

856
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:16,398
<i>but the small tank
of medical grade nitrous oxide...</i>

857
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:18,565
<i>would be needed on the other side.</i>

858
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,473
<i>Past the room that contained their machines
and up two levels...</i>

859
01:01:22,577 --> 01:01:24,340
<i>he made his way to another room...</i>

860
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:29,146
<i>where he had stored what I will refer to
from here on as the Failsafe Machine.</i>

861
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,914
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

862
01:03:14,623 --> 01:03:15,681
Really?

863
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,320
Your cell and work.

864
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,892
I'm not there.

865
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,161
Really?

866
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,999
I don't even know what.

867
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:37,074
I'm just tired.

868
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:41,478
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

869
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:57,726
<i>I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...</i>

870
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,701
<i>friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.</i>

871
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:02,269
<i>But how about this instead?</i>

872
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:06,501
<i>If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...</i>

873
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,373
<i>I will in return show you
the most important thing...</i>

874
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,072
<i>that any living organism has ever witnessed.</i>

875
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:17,744
<i>At this point
there would have been some discussion.</i>

876
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,315
<i>Abe would, of course, want to know how.</i>

877
01:04:25,427 --> 01:04:28,726
<i>Aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest...</i>

878
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:32,289
<i>and how it showed two rooms
under the name Abram Terger.</i>

879
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,796
<i>Then Abe would need to know how.</i>

880
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:39,400
<i>Aaron would explain
that when he went up there...</i>

881
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:41,372
<i>and found the Failsafe running...</i>

882
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:43,569
<i>he knew exactly what it was.</i>

883
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,044
<i>But Abe would ask how.</i>

884
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:50,750
<i>And then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins...</i>

885
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,619
<i>and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another.</i>

886
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,251
<i>They are not one-time use only.</i>

887
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,920
<i>They are recyclable, Aaron would say.</i>

888
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,429
<i>How, Abe would ask.</i>

889
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,573
<i>And Aaron would describe
how simple things become...</i>

890
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:17,971
<i>when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast...</i>

891
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,309
<i>even in a world of tamper-proof lids.</i>

892
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:43,894
<i>How?</i>

893
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:47,807
<i>And that's where
I would have entered the story.</i>

894
01:05:47,909 --> 01:05:50,377
<i>Or exited, depending on your reference.</i>

895
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:56,311
<i>Because when Aaron came back
the second time, it wasn't so easy.</i>

896
01:05:58,586 --> 01:06:01,112
<i>He wasn't expecting me to put up a fight.</i>

897
01:06:01,222 --> 01:06:04,385
<i>And by that time,
he was too exhausted to take me.</i>

898
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,594
<i>But for reasons
that are only evident to me now...</i>

899
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,265
<i>I understood that he simply wanted it more.</i>

900
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,825
<i>That he just had more invested. So I left.</i>

901
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:18,735
<i>He had already performed the task,
as I had intended to...</i>

902
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,277
<i>of recording the conversations of the day
just in case.</i>

903
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,470
<i>Through that earpiece
he had a three-second lead on the world.</i>

904
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,448
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.

905
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,746
I can't. I've got a schedule.

906
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,949
<i>He had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head...</i>

907
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,425
<i>and those around him would fall in line.</i>

908
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:01,447
<i>This is Track 3.</i>

909
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,951
<i>Abe is bringing my car around
and I am on my way to the court.</i>

910
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,213
<i>I'll see Will there.</i>

911
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:10,383
<i>I'll invite him to the party and make sure
he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.</i>

912
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:12,150
<i>Will.</i>

913
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,427
<i>You pretentious prick.</i>

914
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,795
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?

915
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,494
<i>- No, it's a radio, man.
- You look like Secret Service.</i>

916
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,970
- You look like Secret Service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

917
01:07:24,072 --> 01:07:26,472
What? What the hell
am I hanging around here for?

918
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:28,007
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

919
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,838
<i>Nice shot, Aaron.</i>

920
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,139
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.

921
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,376
<i>We could have used that
last week against TI.</i>

922
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,716
<i>At least you've got your golf game.
I see you've been practicing.</i>

923
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:43,519
You come out here with your $3 tie
and think you can play whiteball.

924
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,560
<i>What are you doing tonight?</i>

925
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,789
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you I missed my flight.

926
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,160
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

927
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,757
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

928
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:56,826
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

929
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:59,065
- Big reunion.
- Exactly.

930
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,417
I don't think I'm doing this.

931
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,420
Why not?

932
01:08:21,596 --> 01:08:24,929
Because I can think of a million
different ways that this can happen...

933
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,933
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt.

934
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,936
I can call her and see
if she wants to do something else...

935
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:32,302
or better yet,
not even talk to her about the party.

936
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,468
That's good for tonight. What about
tomorrow? And every other day?

937
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,547
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
- You'll watch her always.

938
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:42,207
This guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun.

939
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,786
What do you think he'll do
if he ever finds her alone?

940
01:08:44,886 --> 01:08:48,322
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

941
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:51,621
At the end of the night,
this guy is arrested and goes to jail.

942
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:54,456
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

943
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:56,461
Now come on, it has to be you.

944
01:08:56,564 --> 01:09:00,999
She said she was there
because you told her you would be there.

945
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:08,406
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

946
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,112
He doesn't fire?

947
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:17,278
- No. He didn't fire.
- He never fires?

948
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,718
- Not even when you rushed him?
- No. He didn't.

949
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,586
He didn't the time I was, when I rushed him.

950
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,284
And from what Robert tells you,
he didn't do it tonight.

951
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,793
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.

952
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:29,454
Okay? We're prescient.

953
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:37,894
We can still be careful.

954
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:40,702
Maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing.

955
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,407
We definitely can.

956
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:46,038
He leaves it in the truck
before he goes in. We don't even need to...

957
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,708
- but if it makes you feel better...
- What's wrong with our hands?

958
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,353
What do you mean?

959
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:55,719
Why can't we write like normal people?

960
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,721
I don't know. I can see the letters.

961
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:07,632
I know what they should look like.
I just can't get my hand to make them easily.

962
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,564
Try comparing it to your left hand.
Mine looks the same.

963
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,591
Guess what today is.

964
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:38,555
No, no. It's your friend Robert's birthday.

965
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,800
He says he likes records,
so I got him The Best of Bread.

966
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:44,667
No, real records, like vinyl.

967
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:49,272
<i>I can tell you with certainty
what I did that night when it was my turn.</i>

968
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:54,242
<i>But I think it would do little good,
because what the world remembers...</i>

969
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:58,047
<i>the actuality,
the last revision is what counts, apparently.</i>

970
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,587
<i>So how many times did it take Aaron...</i>

971
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:04,283
<i>as he cycled
through the same conversations...</i>

972
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,827
<i>lip-synching trivia over and over?</i>

973
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:10,561
<i>How many times would it take
before he got it right?</i>

974
01:11:10,698 --> 01:11:12,529
<i>Three? Four?</i>

975
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:14,862
<i>Twenty?</i>

976
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:19,336
<i>I've decided to believe
that only one more would have done it.</i>

977
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,432
<i>I can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more.</i>

978
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:27,475
<i>Slowly and methodically,
he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.</i>

979
01:11:29,784 --> 01:11:32,275
<i>He took from his surroundings
what was needed...</i>

980
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:34,582
<i>and made of it something more.</i>

981
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,367
<i>And once the details had been
successfully navigated...</i>

982
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:53,737
<i>there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict.</i>

983
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:01,277
<i>Maybe the obligatory
last-minute moral debate...</i>

984
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:04,146
<i>until the noise of the room
escalates into panic...</i>

985
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:07,449
<i>and background screams
as the gunman walks in.</i>

986
01:12:08,856 --> 01:12:12,725
<i>And eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful...</i>

987
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,524
<i>with all the praise and adoration
he had coming.</i>

988
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,155
<i>He had probably saved lives, after all.</i>

989
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,233
<i>Who knows what would have happened
if he hadn't been there?</i>

990
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,619
I know that things are bad, okay?

991
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:45,291
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

992
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,052
I know that you're upset.

993
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:50,791
And to be honest, I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

994
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:54,232
But you know that this is going to pass.
Let's just go.

995
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:57,271
Let's go somewhere
where we don't speak the language.

996
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:59,397
Aaron, we don't have the money back here...

997
01:12:59,507 --> 01:13:01,338
and we'd have to steal our own passports.

998
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,342
Money? We'll make money.

999
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:05,773
They have sports betting in Vegas.
March Madness.

1000
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,816
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

1001
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,977
Passports. You know
they're not using theirs, anyways.

1002
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:14,880
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.

1003
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:17,423
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.

1004
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:19,182
I'm staying here.

1005
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:21,186
Why?

1006
01:13:31,472 --> 01:13:33,907
They'll be building their own boxes
in another day.

1007
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,238
And yours already knows what they've built.

1008
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,507
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

1009
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:42,743
<i>The box Abe is building won't work.</i>

1010
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:45,014
<i>He's got it wired wrong.</i>

1011
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,244
<i>And if they fix that...</i>

1012
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:50,324
<i>I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.
It's just a gimmick.</i>

1013
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,586
<i>It doesn't work anymore.</i>

1014
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,490
<i>Your double will say
they have to move on to something else.</i>

1015
01:13:54,662 --> 01:13:56,527
And mine will agree. They're friends.

1016
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:58,428
You're staying? Why?

1017
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,625
Why? Let's see, why would Abe stay?

1018
01:14:00,735 --> 01:14:03,728
What possible reason could there be
to be here?

1019
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,676
I guess that
it just won't go back far enough, will it?

1020
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,742
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara
and Lauren and put them in the box...

1021
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:19,014
and then you and Aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it.

1022
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,953
- Don't come back.
- You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.

1023
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:24,992
There hasn't been a reason
to show you what I'm capable of...

1024
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:27,425
but I'm telling this you now. Go out there.

1025
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:31,021
Do whatever the hell you want.
There's no way in the world I can stop you.

1026
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:32,827
But don't come back here...

1027
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:34,903
and don't come near them.

1028
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:37,163
Any of them.

1029
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:55,584
<i>Now I have repaid any debt
I may have owed you.</i>

1030
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,920
<i>You know all that I know.</i>

1031
01:14:58,292 --> 01:15:01,819
<i>My voice is the only proof
that you will have of the truth of any of this.</i>

1032
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,626
<i>I might have written a letter
with my signature...</i>

1033
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,257
<i>but my handwriting
is not what it used to be.</i>

1034
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:12,500
<i>Maybe you've had the presence of mind
to record this.</i>

1035
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,132
<i>That's your prerogative.</i>

1036
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,234
<i>You will not be contacted by me again.</i>

1037
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,539
Good morning.

1038
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:21,411
Every half-meter.

1039
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,614
Everywhere.

1040
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:29,115
<i>And if you look, you will not find me.</i>

1041
