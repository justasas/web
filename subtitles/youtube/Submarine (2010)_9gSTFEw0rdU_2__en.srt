1
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,692
(Waves crashing)

2
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,621
(Seagulls cry)

3
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,554
BOY: Most people
think of themselves as individuals,

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,814
that there 's no-one on the planet like them.

5
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,975
This thought motivates them
to get out of bed,

6
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,565
eat food, and walk around
like nothing's wrong.

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,230
My name is Oliver Tate.

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,910
ALEX TURNER: Stuck On The Puzzle (Intro)

9
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:34,938
I'm not the kind of fool
who's gonna sit and sing to you

10
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,984
About stars, girl

11
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,269
But last night I looked up

12
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,566
Into the dark half of the blue

13
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,245
And they'd gone backwards

14
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,618
TEACHER: "What kind of young person am I?"

15
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,412
That's the challenge. We talk about challenges.

16
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,548
Well, that's the challenge
I'm giving you this term.

17
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,674
A gauntlet, so to speak.

18
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,883
But this gauntlet is also an opportunity.

19
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,424
An opportunity for self-discovery.

20
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,594
What do I mean by "self-discovery"?
Mark Pritchard?

21
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,894
- Having a wank, sir?
- (Suppressed laughter)

22
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,350
Discovery of the self.

23
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,394
Who am I?

24
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,859
OLIVER:
I find that the only way to get through life

25
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,525
is to picture myself
in an entirely disconnected reality.

26
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,616
I often imagine
how people would react to my death.

27
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:39,168
Mr Dunthorneis quavering voice
as he makes the announcement.

28
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,834
The shocked faces of my classmates.

29
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,292
A playground bedecked with flowers.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,171
The empty stillness of a school corridor

31
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,843
Local news analysis.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,806
Oliver Tate was a popular
and much-loved pupil.

33
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,847
Many of the people I've spoken to here
referred to him as an example.

34
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,141
He was so funny and so smart.

35
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,935
He's gonna be really missed.
It's so bad. He's so young.

36
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,650
OLIVER: Tear-streaked tributes.

37
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,736
(Sobbing muffles speech)

38
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,745
I just wanted to hug him. I just wish I had.

39
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:19,078
I wish I could have said goodbye,
but I never said anything to him.

40
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,164
OLIVER: The steady stoicism of my parents.

41
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:23,875
All the girls liked him.

42
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,336
Other boys respected him,
looked up to him, I guess.

43
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,591
Candlelit vigils.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,301
We are witnessing incredible,
unprecedented scenes of quiet devotion.

45
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:39,846
Behind me a vigil that's been repeated
all over the country.

46
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,265
A testimony to the love felt for Oliver Tate

47
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,402
and the loss felt by his friends...

48
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,986
and, frankly, by Wales on the whole.

49
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,444
And, finally, my glorious resurrection.

50
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:01,078
Don't ask how. Just know
that I'm now more powerful than ever.

51
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,710
OLIVER: Let's get off.

52
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,149
(Whispers) Zoe.

53
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,282
Zoe, this is for you. it's yours.
It has your name on it. Take it.

54
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,192
- it's not mine.
- Please take it.

55
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,328
That note seems fascinating, Oliver Tate.

56
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,831
You know the rules. Stand up and read it out.

57
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:44,913
I can't. it's Zoe's.
She gave it to me and I was gonna...

58
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,919
(Bell rings)

59
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,048
Saved by the bell once again, Mr Tate.

60
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,629
All right, take your time.

61
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,421
I know you're all gagging
to get to double Biology but don't rush.

62
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,947
Jordana Bevanb only real flaws
are her sporadic bouts of eczema.

63
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,701
Other than that, she has many qualities.

64
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,118
She never speaks about herself
She could be anything.

65
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,204
Perhaps she's a Fabian.

66
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,371
That would make her a socialist
who advocates gradual change.

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,466
She's moderately unpopular,
which makes a romance between us more likely.

68
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,798
She's also a girl- to be seen with her
would improve my street cred,

69
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,713
which, though high, could be higher.

70
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,305
Lastly, she's now single,

71
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,977
cos Mark Pritchard cheated on her
with Abby Smuts at the school disco.

72
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:56,067
The full extent of the betrayal
is still the subject of speculation.

73
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,493
Chips knows there 'S
nothing more attractive than a bully.

74
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,872
He also knows that Zoe Preece
is a legitimate target

75
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,078
because she's overweight
and won't accept notes in class.

76
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,829
Essentially, I disapprove of bullying.

77
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,748
Jordana seems to enjoy it in moderation.

78
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,715
I must not let my principles
stand in the way of progress.

79
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,007
I must be willing to adapt.

80
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,894
Keep up, Tubs!

81
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,557
This was the correct decision.

82
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,151
Give it back now!

83
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,939
This was a vivid memory of youth This wa
would cherish when I was old and frail.

84
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,277
Oh!

85
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,192
Catch. Straight into the hands.

86
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,703
We were working as a team,
testing each other's limits,

87
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,537
challenging one another's bourgeois
assumptions of what was acceptable.

88
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,872
ZOE: Oh, grow up! Grow up!

89
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,880
I knew that these events - although
hard to bear at this precise moment-

90
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,212
would help build Zoe Preece's
character in the long term.

91
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,848
Aargh!

92
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,271
(They laugh)

93
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,651
Wanker!

94
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,829
(Mouths)

95
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,919
Honestly, Zoe, it was an accident.

96
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,456
I mean, it was just unlucky
that you were there and that you fell in.

97
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,252
We were playing...sort of like a game.

98
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,213
And you can replace the stuff
that was in your bag.

99
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,475
- I'm not saying it's cheap...
- Fuck off and die!

100
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,939
In many ways, I prefer my own company.

101
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,944
It gives me time to think.

102
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,778
I suppose it's a bit of an affectation,
but I often read the dictionary.

103
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,070
My word for today is "flagitious'§
which means wickedly shameful.

104
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,963
I live in a large house with my parents.

105
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,878
They tell me that our area
has breathtaking scenery.

106
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,137
I'm not sure I believe in scenery.

107
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,346
However the views allow me
to spy on our new neighbours.

108
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,640
I don't know them yet
but they seem like terrible human beings.

109
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,067
Ninjas.

110
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,823
My parents have not had sex
for seven months.

111
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:51,831
I've been monitoring their intimacy
via the dimmer switch in their bedroom.

112
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,789
I know when they've been at it
because the dial will be set to halfway.

113
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,298
I wish life could be more like
American soap operas.

114
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,637
Then, whenever things got dramatic,

115
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,598
you could just fade the picture down
and pick things up again later

116
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,687
Can you tell your mother to hurry up?
I'll be waiting in the road.

117
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,325
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,237
Yeah, you look good for your age. For a mum.

119
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,914
Mum's getting the bus.

120
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,919
MAN: So...l inherited it all.

121
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,048
Well, er, it's been terrific. Small world, all that.

122
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,083
It's such a lovely area.

123
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,719
This used to be Jill's grandmother's house,
right?

124
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,879
Yes.

125
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,971
The hours we spent up in that room,
listening to records, hatching plans.

126
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,013
Right, yes.
So are you going to be selling up?

127
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,557
Just gonna let things take their own path.

128
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,188
- You have a good day, Lloyd.
- OK, cheers, Graham.

129
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,228
- Give my love to Jill.
- Will do.

130
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,396
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Goodbye.

131
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,456
- You go get 'em, killer.
- I will.

132
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,997
As usual, Dad drops me 800 yards from school.

133
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,918
That way, I can slip in unnoticed, like a torpedo.

134
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,926
Watch your step, motherfucker! Ha-ha

135
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,839
You've got to wake up.
How many times have I told you?

136
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,756
- Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,596
- Griffiths?
- Here, sir.

138
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,135
- Harris?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,803
- Davies?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,597
- Morris?
- Sir.

141
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,140
Preece?

142
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,855
Preece? Anyone seen Zoe?

143
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,065
- Tate?
- Yeah, present.

144
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,232
- Pritchard?
- Yes.

145
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,867
Smuts?

146
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,618
Wanker!

147
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,129
Zoe Preece hasn 't been in school for a while,

148
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,293
so I've written a pamphlet
on how to break out of the victim cycle.

149
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,504
I've also given her two examples to inspire hen

150
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,218
Firstly, Rhydian Bird,

151
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,304
who pulled his trousers down to far?
and followed through,

152
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,061
calling an unhealthy turd onto the tarmac.

153
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,350
But instead of looking embarrassed,
he screamed with laughter and pointed.

154
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,894
Nobody could tease him about it
cos he was so proud.

155
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,777
How do you even know all men read poems?

156
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,190
All men do, unless you're gay. Are you gay?

157
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,825
Secondly Chips.
He wasn 't even considered hot

158
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,283
until the Watkins twins stabbed him
in the back with Compasses.

159
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,699
He said nothing, showed no discomfort

160
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,163
as his shirt blossomed with blood poppies.

161
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,750
His stoicism reminded me of the brave men
who died in the First World War.

162
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,247
Chips is an outstanding bully.

163
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:51,009
He once made our Religious Education teacher
cry using only Blu- Tack.

164
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,795
Right, now, now, now.

165
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,842
I don't quite know what I am yet.

166
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,976
I've tried smoking a pipe...

167
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,808
..flipping coins...

168
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,644
listening exclusively to French crooners.

169
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,605
Other times I go to the beach
and stare at the sea.

170
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,567
Someone made a documentary
about a prominent thinker

171
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,697
who struggled with unspeakable loss.

172
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:15,905
I've even had a brief hat phase.
But nothing stuck.

173
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,039
- Gene.
- What?

174
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,208
The most secure route to Zoe is big Gene,

175
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,005
who, over the last few months,
has become her only friend and confidante.

176
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,094
Gene told me that Zoe had moved schools.

177
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,477
She was very unhappy because she was bullied
and one boy even pushed her into a pond.

178
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,478
Oh...l had no idea.

179
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,687
I persuaded her to give Zoe the pamphlet
by saying it was a love letter.

180
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,271
It's a big love letter.

181
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,356
I've got a big heart.

182
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,524
Sometimes I wish there was a #film crew
following my every move.

183
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,785
I imagine the camera craning up
as I walk away.

184
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,615
But, unless things improve,

185
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,827
the biopic of my life will only have
the budget for a zoom out.

186
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,095
I feel bad, cutting into his head.

187
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,931
Why? It's just a fucking frog.

188
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,969
It's still a thing, though. It had life.

189
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,104
Where do you think they get the frogs?

190
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,358
I don't know.
Probably a lake or a river nearby.

191
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,894
They probably have a guy that does it.
I could End out.

192
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,153
- I don't actually want to know.
- Neither do I.

193
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,941
- I'm just saying. You asked...
- I wonder where Fat is.

194
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,198
- Zoe?
- Mm.

195
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:40,327
- She hasn't been in school for a while.
- I hadn't noticed.

196
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,580
I thought you would have.
She leaves a big gap.

197
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,115
She's not on my radar.

198
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,956
- ls it cos we pushed her into the pond?
- I didn't push her.

199
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,463
- Think she's weeping herself to death?
- I didn't push her.

200
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,247
Maybe you should write to her.

201
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,468
Maybe you should write her
a pamphlet or something.

202
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,127
What do you think?

203
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,304
What is this?

204
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,473
What do you want from me?

205
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:05,226
Meet me under the railway bridge after school
and we'll take it from there.

206
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,850
JORDANA:
Bring a Polaroid camera and a diary.

207
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,150
OK?

208
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,742
(Train clatters by overhead)

209
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,379
- Got the camera and the diary?
- Do you have the pamphlet?

210
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,666
Give me the camera.

211
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,173
OK.

212
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,020
Now kneel down.

213
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,024
Please, Jordana... What is this?

214
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,402
Kneel down.

215
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,026
Close your eyes.

216
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,205
(Train clattering)

217
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,384
We kissed until our lips felt swollen.

218
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,221
Her mouth tasted of milk, Polo mints
and Dunhill International.

219
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,902
OK. Now take out the diary
and write today's date.

220
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,082
Write a few paragraphs on how excited
you are to have kissed me.

221
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,745
Mention what a dick Mark Pritchard is
and slag off Abby Sluts.

222
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,504
- it's Smuts.
- Let's call her Sluts.

223
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,417
I sit next to her in Geography, so we're mates.

224
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,551
I don't need your life stony.

225
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,763
Wow. You look mentally retarded.

226
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,676
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

227
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,599
I had in fact only kissed
one person before - Zoe Preece.

228
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:17,894
It was after the Cowboys And Indians
school disco.

229
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,108
I told her if we were going to do it,
we had to hide behind the refectory.

230
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,445
Her tongue was blue
from blackcurrant squash.

231
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,484
It smouldered in the cold.

232
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,945
OK, I've done it.

233
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,040
Good.

234
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,079
- Can I have the pamphlet now?
- No.

235
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,625
- What will you do with the photos?
- Leave them lying around school.

236
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,634
For people to accidentally ind.

237
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,169
Oh.

238
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,884
What are you complaining about?

239
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,766
This is conclusive proof
that you might not be gay.

240
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,894
CHILDREN: Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

241
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,148
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

242
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,936
Come on, gay boy, take back
what you said about me!

243
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,774
I take it back. I take it back.

244
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,656
And admit that you're in fact a gaylord.

245
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,738
(Jeering)

246
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,869
No. Do not admit it.

247
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,451
- Do not admit that.
- Shut up, Chips.

248
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,662
Fine. I'm gay. I'm very gay.

249
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,826
(Shouting and laughter)

250
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,754
And Jordana's a slut.

251
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,499
- Jordana is a slut.
- No.

252
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,167
Say it. Say it!

253
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,961
No.

254
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,005
Don't be a dick, Mark. Just let him go.

255
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,177
Fine. I'll let him go.

256
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,096
I'll let him go.

257
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,142
If...he admits you're a slut.

258
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,184
- Ooh.
- Just say it, gay boy.

259
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,229
Say it.

260
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,662
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Fucking big gay.

261
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,878
I was completely overbalanced.

262
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,671
It was luck. I'm gonna get him for this.
I'll bring him so much pain.

263
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,214
Probably catch him like he caught me,
on the sly.

264
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,846
Blood.

265
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,894
- Are you gonna get up now?
- Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

266
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,334
- You've got scaly hands.
- it's eczema.

267
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,410
Now that we had kissed
for non-blackmail purposes,

268
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:24,580
I thought it gentlemanly
to escort Jordana home.

269
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,125
When there, I asked if
she was my girlfriend now. And she said:

270
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,293
I'll think about it.

271
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,255
But what she meant was, yes.

272
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,966
We are now as one.

273
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:45,975
(Gulls crying)

274
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,702
Whenever I'm late home from school,

275
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,082
my mother assumes I've been abducted
and left to drown in a lake.

276
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,701
There he is. Oliver?

277
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,750
My mother is worried
that I have mental problems.

278
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,336
I found a book about
teenage paranoid delusions

279
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,093
during a routine Search
of my parents' bedroom.

280
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,471
After that, I started slipping choice phrases
into our conversation.

281
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,554
My body has been replaced by a shell.
My organs are made of stone.

282
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,560
- I've been dead for years.
- Right.

283
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,940
My mother is naturally neurotic and in her youth
even dreamed of being an actress.

284
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,103
Until she was told by a speech therapist
her tongue was too big for her mouth.

285
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,569
Now she works for the council's Legal
and Democratic Services department.

286
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,197
(Photocopier whirs)

287
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,407
One of the rules in her office

288
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,572
- is that if it's your birthday...
- Ta-da.

289
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,367
... you are held responsible
for bringing your own cake to work.

290
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,582
- Happy birthday, Jill.
- Thank you.

291
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,793
Oliver?

292
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,832
Oliver, come here.

293
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,547
Come here.

294
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,378
Where are you going, Oliver?

295
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,931
OK, sit up.

296
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,816
- Are you being victimized again?
- No. I'm never victimized.

297
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,601
You were, in primary school and Cubs.

298
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,896
- I don't remember.
- I do. There was a lot of crying.

299
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,859
- Is it drug related?
- How?

300
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,899
- I don't know. You tell me.
- it's not.

301
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,942
- Your pupils are huge.
- it's dark.

302
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,908
- ls it self-harm?
- Why would I punch myself in the eye?

303
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,823
- I really don't know.
- I wouldn't. This is stupid.

304
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,869
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

305
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,664
OK, I got into a Tight.

306
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,253
I was defending the honour of my girlfriend.

307
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,884
GK, fine.

308
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,012
You're not being serious, it's fine.

309
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,048
No, I am. I have a girlfriend now.

310
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,091
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,680
- Do you?
- Yeah.

312
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,311
- Really?
- Yeah.

313
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,346
Of course.

314
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,857
Yes, of course. I mean, why wouldn't... I didn't...

315
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,940
- Did you think I was...
- No, I didn't. Come here.

316
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,104
(She grunts)

317
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,370
What a lovely little chat. You're doing so well.

318
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,305
So?

319
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,340
K-nock, k-nock, can I come in?

320
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,010
This was the happiest
I 'd seen my father for years.

321
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:29,389
Not too long ago, I discovered
an empty bottle of anti-depressants,

322
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,184
during another routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

323
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,400
My research indicates it all started
when he was sacked from his job

324
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,486
presenting on the Open University.

325
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,524
My father is a marine biologist,

326
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,662
and introduced a segment
called Mysteries Of The Deep.

327
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,696
But he was an uneasy screen presence

328
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,458
and never knew quite what to do with his hands.

329
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,874
After his dismissal,
he spent several days in bed,

330
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,881
drinking hot lemon from the same mug
and never washing it,

331
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,008
a key sign of one of his downturns.

332
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,260
Now he works at the local university,

333
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,388
doing a job he Ends difficult to explain

334
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,550
to anyone without
a degree-level knowledge of fish.

335
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,306
Listen, I hope you don't mind.

336
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:13,395
But your mother informs me
that you have a girlfriend.

337
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,903
Is there anything I can help you with there?

338
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,812
I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know.

339
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,573
OK. All right.

340
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,575
Yes. Er...listen...

341
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,236
I know you think I'm very boring, you know.

342
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,701
But once...l ripped my vest off
in front of a woman

343
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,125
and er...it was very effective, actually.

344
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,254
I know.

345
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,757
It produced a very atavistic response.

346
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,088
That's just something to bear in mind.

347
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,385
And listen, I made you a cassette recording.

348
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:50,433
It's a compilation of songs I used to listen to
during some of my early formative relationships.

349
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,769
Plus a couple of things I thought you might dig.

350
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,277
I think music can make things seem
a bit more real, sometimes,

351
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,232
- if you know what I mean.
- Thanks.

352
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:01,443
I've also included some break-up songs
towards the end,

353
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,201
just in case things don't work out.

354
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,411
Which, obviously, you know, that isn't the aim,
though, I'm gonna tell you, it is likely.

355
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,241
Passion rarely lasts, I'm afraid.

356
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,702
All right, well...

357
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:17,713
good night and erm...well done!

358
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,592
It's an achievement. It really is, of sorts.

359
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,843
Good night, son.

360
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,657
Tomorrow I'll be quicker

361
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,531
I'll stare into the strobe light flicker

362
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,618
And afloat I'll stay

363
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,672
But I'm quite all right hiding today

364
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,963
I Tomorrow I'll be faster

365
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,673
I'll catch what I've been chasing after

366
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,842
And have time to play

367
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:16,856
But I'm quite all right hiding today

368
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,856
And I will play the coconut shy

369
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,861
And win a prize even if it's rigged

370
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,701
I won't know when to stop

371
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,037
And you can leave off my lid

372
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,203
And I won't even lose my fizz

373
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,834
I'll be the polka dots type

374
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,722
I'll know the way back if you know the way

375
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,599
But if you are, I am quite all right

376
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,225
Hiding today

377
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,571
Jordana and I enjoyed a glorious
atavistic fortnight of lovemaking,

378
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,982
humiliating teachers and bullying the weak.

379
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,652
I've already turned these moments
into the Super-8 footage of memory.

380
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,749
Tomorrow I'll be stronger

381
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,419
Running colorful

382
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,426
No longer just in black and white

383
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:33,634
And quite all right hiding tonight

384
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:40,683
And I will have a game on the coconut shy

385
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,942
And win a prize even if it's rigged

386
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:50,780
I I won't know when to stop
and you can leave off my lid

387
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,948
And I won't even lose my fizz

388
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:59,872
I'll be the polka dots type

389
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:05,583
I'll probably swim through a few lagoons

390
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,625
I'll have a spring in my step

391
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,591
And I'll get there soon

392
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:13,927
To sing you a happy tune

393
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:17,301
Tomorrow

394
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,971
And you'd better bring a change of clothes

395
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:26,020
So we can sail our laughing pianos

396
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,820
Along a beam of light

397
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:40,163
But I'm quite all right hiding tonight

398
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,833
it's fucking ridiculous! How long's it been?

399
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,673
Two weeks. it's fucking ridiculous!

400
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,836
I'm not bothered. We've as good as done it.

401
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,007
Never take more than a week
between everything but and stuffing it in.

402
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,017
She's taking the piss. Keiron, back me up.

403
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,098
- She's taking the piss, man.
- Thank you.

404
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,262
Watch out, she's looking.

405
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,434
Is she still looking?

406
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,195
Yep.

407
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:12,399
Jordana hates any place
that could be termed romantic.

408
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,819
With this in mind, I took her to
one of my favourite industrial estates,

409
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,988
for some quality one-on-one time.

410
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,040
This is nice, isn't it?

411
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,376
JORDANA: Yeah, it's not bad.

412
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,218
OLIVER:
I mean, you know, we get on pretty well.

413
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,216
JORDANA: Yeah, it's fun.

414
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,682
And we're getting more and more intimate.

415
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,892
Intimate?

416
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,229
Yeah, you know, we've done things.
We've been intimate.

417
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,228
We have been intimate, yeah.

418
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,487
My parents are going to the cinema
on Thursday.

419
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,403
It's a tradition. They go every Thursday evening.

420
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,570
So what I'm saying is, it's empty.

421
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:02,749
The house. On Thursday. The house is empty.

422
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,160
On Thursday evening, it's an empty house.

423
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,203
So what do you think?

424
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,170
Are you asking me to come round
and have sex with you?

425
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,506
If I say yes, does that lessen
the chance of you wanting to?

426
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,468
Before I answer that,
I just want to check one thing.

427
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,099
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- it's quite serious.

428
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:23,263
Of course, yeah. Go ahead, you should
be able to ask what you want to ask.

429
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,935
Will the house be empty?

430
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,770
Write down the reasons why I should.

431
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,952
OK.

432
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,959
It's Thursday. You're going to the cinema?
You should leave.

433
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,969
Is that what you wear to lounge around?

434
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,300
Your father doesn't want to go out
all of a sudden.

435
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,557
I've been looking forward to it.
I didn't realise there'd be others.

436
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,140
- They're our neighbours.
- Who, the ninjas?

437
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,897
It's Thursday, our cinema night.
it's not a free-for-all.

438
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,649
Do not call them ninjas, Oliver. it's racist.

439
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,980
He's white.

440
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,316
They don't strike me as big Eric Rohmer fans.

441
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,652
Why don't the three of you just go and see
some tat at the Odeon?

442
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,567
- I'll just stay in.
- You should both go.

443
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,735
- So rude, Lloyd.
- (Doorbell)

444
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,154
(Rings again)

445
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,323
Oh, for God's sake.

446
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,085
- Oh, Graham.
- Whoa!

447
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,174
- Oh, not really...
- Hey.

448
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,181
- Oh, thanks.
- (Chuckles)

449
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,341
Are you all right?

450
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,852
- Whoargh!
- (Giggles)

451
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,262
You look lovely.

452
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,852
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry I'm a bit early.

453
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,690
It's just, there's a fantastic
noodle bar right next to the cinema.

454
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,196
Kim-Lin and I would love to take
you and Lloyd...

455
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,198
- Ninjas.
- My treat.

456
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,859
- Very sweet.
- No need to take two cars, right?

457
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,528
Plenty of room in the van.

458
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:05,196
Do you mind jumping in the back, here, Lloyd?

459
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,785
Hop right in there,
make yourself comfortable.

460
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,330
All right there, buddy? Great.

461
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,916
(Van starts)

462
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,198
(Clock ticking)

463
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,258
(Wind howling)

464
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,068
(Doorbell rings)

465
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:31,323
Thanks for living up a fucking hill.

466
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:36,416
Sorry, I had to er...go to the toilet.

467
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,124
I'm OK now. It doesn't matter.

468
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,714
Just gonna top this up quickly.

469
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,547
There we go.

470
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,726
To us, and a wonderful evening of lovemaking.

471
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,932
Can you just get off my shoulders?

472
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:57,099
I'm just directing you, just...

473
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,773
Right, OK, just don't open them.
I'll tell you when. Stay there.

474
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,361
- What, now?
- Yeah.

475
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,490
Fucking hell, you're a serial killer.

476
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,420
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't know whether you'd like it.

477
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,875
But we can learn from it. I've learned from it.

478
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,212
I think you've learned from it.
Maybe we could start again.

479
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,173
- I've gotta go home.
- OK, cool. You should go home.

480
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,432
I'll give you this. it's just a letter
I was gonna give you. Just take it.

481
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,592
It's nothing.

482
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,599
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, I... Yeah...

483
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,764
- You...
- OK, bye.

484
00:33:51,403 --> 00:33:54,407
Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me
explore your perfect body.

485
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,700
I could drink your blood.

486
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:59,040
You're the only person I would allow
to be shrunk to microscopic size

487
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,456
and swim inside me
in a tiny submersible machine.

488
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,375
We've lost our virginity
but it wasn't like losing anything.

489
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,719
You're too good for me.
You're too good for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.

490
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,134
Don't get cocky.

491
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,063
(Wind howls)

492
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,238
- (Door slams)
- How was the Elm?

493
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,743
I'm going to bed.

494
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,451
It's nice to see something lightweight
once in a while,

495
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,081
that you don't have to think about.

496
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,082
Relationships are tough, aren't they?

497
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,786
You should be in bed, Oliver.

498
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,298
Tonight, I stumbled across
an encyclopedia entry on ultrasound.

499
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,260
Ultrasound is a sound vibration
too high frequency to be audible.

500
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,175
It was first developed to locate
submerged objects -

501
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,143
submarines, depth charges, Atlantis and such.

502
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,272
Some animals, like bats, dolphins and dogs

503
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,775
can hear within the ultrasonic frequency.

504
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,936
But no human can.

505
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,777
No-one can truly know
what anyone thinks or feels.

506
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,940
What's inside Mum?

507
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,027
What's inside Dad?

508
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:56,950
What's inside Jordana?

509
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,538
We 're all traveling under the radar, undetected.

510
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,702
And no-one can do a thing about it.

511
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:07,339
- Any more word from Graham?
- Nothing to report, Jackie.

512
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,172
- We went to the cinema as normal.
- How did that go?

513
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,586
Awkward, of course.

514
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,347
Lloyd sulked
because we watched Crocodile Dundee

515
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,179
rather than one of his dark numbers,
I don't know.

516
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,221
But I really laughed.
I thought it was very charming.

517
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,981
And I could see why someone like her
would go for someone like him.

518
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:27,609
Graham is still very attractive.
He probably felt threatened.

519
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,738
Lloyd is far too self-involved
to feel threatened, Jackie.

520
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,773
He knows Graham was your first love...

521
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,817
- He wasn't my first love.
- Come on.

522
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:36,360
- I was 18.
- Pardon?

523
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,905
18. Look, I've got to go. I'll call you back.

524
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,166
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow, OK.

525
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,369
(Hangs up)

526
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,161
Lloyd?

527
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:47,871
Were you listening in to that?

528
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,916
LLOYD: Sorry, what?

529
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,380
I could hear you breathe, Lloyd.

530
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:01,560
Why hadn't my parents told me
that Graham was Mum 's first love?

531
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,019
No wonder their cinema outing
had ended in such a schism.

532
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,934
I can only assume the subject
of wife-swapping was raised

533
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,023
and Dad didn't feel emotionally ready.

534
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:13,234
Is it possible that Mum would cheat on Dad?

535
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,320
Will they get divorced?

536
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,700
They don't even row.

537
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,862
They just have discussions.

538
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:22,702
I'm going to have to increase my surveillance.

539
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,771
Good night, Oliver.

540
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,302
(Wind howls)

541
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,402
(Grunts enthusiastically)

542
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,990
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

543
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,327
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

544
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,038
Yargh!

545
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,423
(Gulls screeching)

546
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,179
Thank you very much, Jeff.

547
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,817
I got you these books.
They're really meaningful to me.

548
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,105
This is Shakespeare's most mature work,
miles better than Hamlet.

549
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,989
Just more developed thematically.

550
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:21,867
And this is Nietzsche, one of the most
influential philosophers of modern time.

551
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:25,029
I don't agree with all he says
but he makes some interesting points.

552
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:28,790
And this is The Catcher In The Rye,
a great modern American novel.

553
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,826
Salinger's very influential.

554
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,461
Why are you doing this?

555
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:36,170
I thought it'd be nice to get some
mutual interest, now we've had sex,

556
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:38,629
other than spitting and setting things on tire.

557
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,670
Why would I want to be more like you?

558
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,009
Just try not to crack the spines or burn them.

559
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,675
We should get in. It starts in an hour.
I want to get a good seat.

560
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,471
It's rude to leave a film before it's Finished.

561
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,891
- Who to?
- The film-makers.

562
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,433
- How do they know?
- They just do.

563
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,228
- How?
- They do.

564
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,522
- There wasn't even any sound on it.
- There was never intended to be.

565
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,817
- Then why did they write it?
- Kiss me.

566
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,284
(Laughing) Get off me!

567
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,405
- What are you doing?
-Just kiss me.

568
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,791
(Laughing) Get the fuck off me, you freak.

569
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,713
That was fucking ridiculous.

570
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,295
"Kiss me!" Who says that?

571
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,132
- It was a kiss. I tried to be romantic.
- What the fuck?

572
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,762
- You were crushing my face.
- Yeah, in a romantic way.

573
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,389
I'm not in the mood.

574
00:40:27,382 --> 00:40:30,135
It seems pretty clear
that Mum is having an affair.

575
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,681
Why else would she be at the hairdresser's
with Graham the ninja?

576
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:36,442
He probably makes sure
all his prospective sex partners

577
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,820
are salon fresh before impregnating them
with a ninja love child.

578
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:40,695
Cheers.

579
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,324
Mum normally just gets a trim
from her work colleague Jackie.

580
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,074
But now I think of it,
she did mention her hair the other day.

581
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,907
I used to have long hair like her.

582
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:51,916
Hm?

583
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,951
I used to have long hair, remember?

584
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,994
Hm, yes.

585
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:59,131
- Pretty, isn't she?
- I dunno.

586
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:01,291
Do you like my hair long?

587
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,920
- Er...
- Or short like now?

588
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,471
Well, you know...
I like your hair no matter how long it is.

589
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,305
But did you prefer it long?

590
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,844
Either way's good.

591
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,307
No opinion.

592
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,347
Well, it's up to you.

593
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,063
So it wouldn't bother you if I shaved it all off?

594
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,603
Not if it made you happy.

595
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,816
If you want to shave off your hair, you should.

596
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,108
Why would I shave my hair off, Lloyd?
What a stupid idea.

597
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,201
Yeah.

598
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,789
I can imagine my mum calmly leaving one day
while Dad helps her pack.

599
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:36,326
So er...got any plans?

600
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,371
No, not really.

601
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,414
No, just...

602
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,583
see how it goes, really.

603
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,619
Are you planning on getting dressed today?

604
00:42:17,784 --> 00:42:20,253
- Do you want to take the car?
- That's fine.

605
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:24,007
I'm going to work from home today
so if you want to take the car...

606
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,592
I was planning on going to see
one of Graham's talks tonight.

607
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,132
- OK.
- You don't mind?

608
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,050
- Why would I mind?
- It just means I won't be in tonight.

609
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,096
- I'll make sure I keep myself busy.
- Oliver, you coming?

610
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,640
- I'd like a moment with my father.
- Lovely.

611
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,807
I'll see you in the car.

612
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,483
(Turns tap on)

613
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,614
I think Mum might be having an affair.

614
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,775
Can you turn the tap off, please?

615
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,579
I saw her in town with Graham
and heard her on the phone talking about him.

616
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,411
You shouldn't be spying on people.

617
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,874
I just saw them and accidentally
picked up the phone. Aren't you worried?

618
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,380
- Graham's an old friend of Mum's.
- They've met up.

619
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,380
- Yes.
- So you're condoning this affair?

620
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:07,884
There is no affair. He's just some bloke
I stole your mother from.

621
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,341
So you admit they have a history?

622
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,974
I think you should go to your mother now, OK?

623
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,480
- Thanks, Mum.
- Just a second, we're early.

624
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,516
How are things with Jordana?

625
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:23,934
Fine.

626
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,902
- You ever going to let us meet her?
- Maybe if you get a terminal illness.

627
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,065
So things are serious between you two?

628
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,827
It may seem like a big deal now
but it probably won't matter when you're my age.

629
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:34,702
38?

630
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,081
- Just be careful.
- I always use condoms.

631
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,115
Good.

632
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,876
You know that your dad and I
are going through a bit of a tough time.

633
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,380
And I want you to know
we really appreciate you trying to help.

634
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,293
- I'm not trying to help.
- You're a loud Whisperer.

635
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,335
You shouldn't spy on people.

636
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,380
Why have you been meeting Graham?

637
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:56,518
Graham is an old friend and has had
relationship problems with Kim-Lin.

638
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,552
He needed someone he could talk to.

639
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,438
- So he might be single soon?
- Goodbye, Oliver.

640
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,356
- Mum?
- Yes?

641
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,942
Who would you save first in a fire,

642
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:12,655
given the hypothetical situation
that Dad and I were equally hard to save?

643
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,744
I'd go for you but I'd feel bad for your father.

644
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:17,779
OK.

645
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,797
- Kiss me!
- What?

646
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:35,806
(Laughs)

647
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,184
I still can't believe you fucking said it.

648
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,221
I did not say it in a high-pitched...
like a little mouse.

649
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,481
- You cried it.
- Come on, we're late.

650
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:49,565
- That gap gets smaller every day.
- What are you doing tonight?

651
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,401
I'm busy tonight.

652
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,985
Doing what?

653
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,821
As in, I've got stuff to do. Busy.

654
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,702
No, you never have anything to do.
What are you doing?

655
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,739
GRAHAM: What is light?

656
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:02,991
What is light?

657
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:07,663
How important is light?

658
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,175
OK, let's think about that for a minute.

659
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:15,679
Cos it seems very basic and banal but it's not.
It's loaded.

660
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,556
It's a bloody nail bomb.

661
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:23,224
I think light is probably
the most important gift we have

662
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,264
from the universe.

663
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,731
And if you asked any intelligent bloody writer,

664
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,862
like Professor Hawking or anybody of that ilk,

665
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,233
he could talk to you...

666
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,621
for about, I don't know, a year...

667
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,952
just about bloody light!

668
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,036
We don't want to be in the dark,

669
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,954
being fiddled with.

670
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,998
That's for sure.

671
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:53,041
How's my dad meant to compete?

672
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,085
The only time I saw him enthral a room

673
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,883
was when he gave a talk about
the disappearance of a giant sturgeon.

674
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,934
Sturgeons are royal fish, since the 14th century,

675
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,436
and, if caught,
they do become property of the Crown.

676
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:07,438
So, yes, we're treating the matter as suspicious.

677
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,481
How deep is the ocean?

678
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,989
Seven miles at its deepest point,
but on average, six miles as a rule of thumb.

679
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,400
But no fish could live down there.

680
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:21,945
There's no light, of course,
and the pressure is far too great.

681
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,615
Any human who found themselves at that level,

682
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,659
well, they would die immediately.

683
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,579
They would implode.
They wouldn't stand a chance.

684
00:46:29,744 --> 00:46:31,621
But in answer to your question,

685
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,258
the ocean is six miles deep.

686
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,471
I am a prism.

687
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,632
That's not mad.

688
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,224
OK? I am a prism, I am light.

689
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,929
I am lucid.

690
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,767
I am exciting and delicious.

691
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:53,230
Thanks very much for today.
You've been fantastic.

692
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:08,829
Well done.

693
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,336
- It seemed to go pretty well.
- Oh, yes, yes.

694
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:13,371
I think they...

695
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,008
- They loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

696
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,839
Absolutely.

697
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,007
A lot to take in.

698
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,047
- But it was silly, right?
- No, no.

699
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:24,136
- You think I'm silly?
- No, I don't.

700
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,894
- It's OK.
- I don't. I don't.

701
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,721
I didn't ask for this, Jill.

702
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,688
This gift, it's... It's like a burden to me.

703
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,727
Sure.

704
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,271
Yeah, you must be exhausted.

705
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:41,858
I split up with Kim-Lin.

706
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,027
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

707
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,992
Let her go.

708
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,408
- She was young, right?
- I'm really sorry.

709
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,498
- it's all good.
- Anyway, I'd better... I'd better go.

710
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:53,707
- Gonna come next week?
- Er...

711
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,331
- I can?
- You'd better.

712
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,842
Sure. I'll check my diary.

713
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,595
- Bring Lloyd.
- Um...

714
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,755
OK. I don't think it's really...

715
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,975
...his cup of... I'll ask.

716
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,010
If you ask him...

717
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,179
he will come.

718
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,101
- I'll see what I can do.
- Right.

719
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,987
- Thank you again. You're very good.
- Ciao, Jill.

720
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,114
- Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

721
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,442
Bye-bye.

722
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:36,329
I'm watching you.

723
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,420
And by being in balance
with the colours around them,

724
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,804
with a healthy colour glow around themselves,

725
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,840
they're living a fulfilled life.

726
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:52,434
So when you're in a crisis, it doesn't
feel like the waves are crashing on you,

727
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,518
it feels like you can just stand
under those waves

728
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,561
and let them do their business,

729
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:03,824
and then get a towel and bloody dry yourself off
and go about your day.

730
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,405
That's what it means.

731
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,615
My mum is the exact type of person

732
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,200
who is susceptible to this mystic bullshit.

733
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,115
I can picture her telling Jackie at work

734
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,454
how it's a bit over the top

735
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,119
but there 's something in it.

736
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,163
If my dad radiated a colour,

737
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,376
it'd be ochre or eggshell.

738
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,552
He knows the number for the pothole
helpline off by heart.

739
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,714
It's about a foot in diameter.
it's a bit of a concern.

740
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,639
(Whispers) Pothole.

741
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:31,597
Yes, that's right, Lloyd Tate.
Oh, hi, how are you?

742
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,481
He was the first person in our village
to install double glazing.

743
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:39,733
It's from Dad.

744
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,770
He ruins every Christmas.

745
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:43,938
It's a kettle.

746
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,025
Great.

747
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,614
..how extraordinary they are.

748
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,447
Because they've forgotten, right?

749
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,083
OLIVER: Maybe it's time for Dad
to rip off his vest again.

750
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,496
I mean, it's a bit over the top,
but I think there's something in it.

751
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,334
Yes, yes. Good turnout, was it?

752
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,090
I'm going out for a bit.

753
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,383
The question was, do I tell Jordana
about this Graham situation?

754
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,422
I mean, we 'd had sex.

755
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,467
Wouldn't it spoil things
if I suddenly got emotional?

756
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:17,723
I decided to soften the blow
with some light arson.

757
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,648
You don't talk about your parents much.

758
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,738
- I mean, do they get on?
- Yeah, they get on.

759
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,905
Mine get on as well. it's good, isn't it?
it's important that they get on.

760
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,666
So everything's time at home,
everything's OK?

761
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,871
Cos everything's fine with me.

762
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,172
Actually, my mum's not well at the moment.

763
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,002
They get on, you know.

764
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:44,757
That's the main thing.

765
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:46,880
Yeah.

766
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:51,257
Sorry, did you say your mum wasn't well?

767
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:52,298
Yeah.

768
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,969
Why, what's wrong?

769
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,681
She's got...

770
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,896
it's called.medulloblastoma.

771
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,319
What does it mean?

772
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,402
It means she's got a brain tumour.

773
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,577
Oh, no.

774
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,166
Confiding in Jordana was now impossible.

775
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,590
Her mother had cancer.

776
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:30,346
And in the Top Trumps of parental problems,
cancer beats potential infidelity.

777
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,261
I would have to travel this road secretly,

778
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,097
unaided,

779
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,012
a renegade,

780
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:40,100
a solitary samurai.

781
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:00,954
: (plays)

782
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,679
Things were a lot less fun since
Jordana 3 mother might die

783
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,516
and my parents' marriage
staffed falling apart

784
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:22,306
I've been working on strategies
to solve both problems.

785
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,023
I bought my dad some new aftershave,
but I'm drawing a blank on the cancer.

786
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:34,242
CHIP: You're fucked. Even if her mum
is terminal, it can still take ages.

787
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,652
Please, Chip, shut up.

788
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:37,570
This is not what you signed up for.

789
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,581
This is about dipping your wick.
You've done that, game over.

790
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,835
She'll be in no mood to put out any more.

791
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,414
No more Yuletide logging for you,

792
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,831
unlike me, who shall be rolling in it
throughout the festive period.

793
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,965
Do you actually pre-prepare these lines?

794
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,001
I just split lines as they come to me.

795
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,967
You've got to shut the shit down.
Keiron, get my back.

796
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,972
- With extreme prejudice.
- Thank you.

797
00:52:57,132 --> 00:53:00,351
- Nothing's changed.
- Do what you want. Remember two things:

798
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,353
one - treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

799
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,389
Two - don't mix family and bush.

800
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,856
Get the fuck out of here.
Merry Christmas. Have a good 'un.

801
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,358
You all right?

802
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,900
You've gotta shut this shit down.
it's fucking ridiculous.

803
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,364
ALEX TURNER: Glass In The Park

804
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,048
If there's glass in the park

805
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:35,546
Darling, I can't help but keep

806
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:40,138
Making appointments to sweep

807
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,146
Beneath the climbing frame

808
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,731
If the sun's in your eyes

809
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:54,565
I'll tighten your blindfold, baby

810
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:59,324
Don't worry, your foot won't get cut

811
00:53:59,485 --> 00:54:02,989
Strut carelessly

812
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,793
I've been taking my duty as a boyfriend
seriously.

813
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,751
Last night, I reread the book
I Only Want What”s Best For You.

814
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,414
I remembered a chapter that says:

815
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,128
(Reads)

816
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:25,054
It's therefore in Jordana's interest
that her dog dies before her mother does.

817
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:27,096
Then we can get things back on track.

818
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,686
(Phone rings)

819
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,446
Oliver Tate.

820
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,608
OK, calm down.

821
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,654
What happened?

822
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,249
There was no need to poison Jordana 's dog

823
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,910
because Jordana's dog
had just been hit by a train.

824
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,954
I scraped his remains
into the bin liner I 'd brought.

825
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,625
The death of a pet makes it easier
to accept the death of a parent.

826
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,467
I could feel the tension between Jordana and
start to slip away.

827
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,352
Oh!

828
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,691
No, of course, I'm sorry. I just...

829
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,855
I thought...

830
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,027
We should bury him.

831
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,992
No, I don't think we should.

832
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,327
Foxes dig up dead animals and eat them.

833
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,661
What should we do, then?

834
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,958
Well, there's this thing the Vikings used to do.

835
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,719
Jude would like to meet you.

836
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,603
- Who's Jude?
- My mum.

837
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,514
Since when have you called her Jude?

838
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,523
Since she might die in two weeks.

839
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,980
Right.

840
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,019
So, do you wanna come?

841
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,325
The Bevans had Christmas dinner early
in case it was the last one they had.

842
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,706
I hoped it wouldn't be,
cos the turkey was quite dry

843
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,413
and the spouts had turned mushy
and out of focus.

844
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:11,873
This is crackin', love.

845
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,707
Yeah, it's great. Thank you, Mrs Bevan.

846
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,340
This is my last warning. it's Jude.

847
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,798
So, I hear from my little girl
that you've stolen her heart.

848
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,677
Dad...

849
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,588
Let me tell you,
if you're lucky enough to ind an angel,

850
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:29,055
hold onto her with everything you've got.

851
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,639
Oh, these fucking lights!

852
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:37,768
Cheap shit.

853
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,442
Oh, come on.

854
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,121
You're acting like I'm dead already.

855
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,577
Come on.

856
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,992
It'd take more than
some silly tumour to kill me.

857
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,833
- It might not.
- Oh, come on, now. Don't be daft.

858
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,458
- Sorry.
- All right.

859
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,043
Oh, it's all right, darling. Ssh.

860
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,755
- Come here.
- Sorry, love.

861
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,139
Are you all right? Come on.

862
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,674
- Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.

863
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,592
Sorry.

864
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,806
- All right?
- Yeah.

865
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:12,096
I'm fine. I'm Time. Give us a cudge.

866
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,602
Listen... Thank you.

867
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,391
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

868
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:19,858
Thank you for looking after Jordana,
for walking through the ire with her.

869
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,646
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- No.

870
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,032
- No, we both do.
- He's a good boy, isn't he?

871
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,692
Part of the family now. Deal?

872
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:27,155
- Deal?
- Deal.

873
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,615
Family, deal.

874
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,951
Deal, yes?

875
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,160
There we fucking go.

876
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,848
Maybe you should come to the hospital
this Friday.

877
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,068
Mum will have had her operation by then
and we can visit.

878
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,652
- If you felt like it.
- Er, Friday.

879
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,070
I've got to do some Christmas shopping.

880
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,655
- What?
- I always leave it too late.

881
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,115
- I want to get you something good.
- Mother might die.

882
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:11,324
- I know.
- Do you care,

883
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:13,489
- or couldn't you give a fuck?
- I do, clearly.

884
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,125
I'll come. When is it?

885
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,034
Friday.

886
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:19,956
Great, yeah.

887
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:23,922
Yeah, Friday's good for me, actually.
Yeah, I can do that. Excellent.

888
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,302
Your skin's better. You're allergic to the dog.

889
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,588
I'm eating better.

890
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,177
Following Mum's special diet.

891
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,262
Is that because of the...

892
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,302
We eat lots of ginger now.

893
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,471
So, Friday.

894
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,811
The visiting hours are six till eight.

895
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,818
Got it. Six till eight. I'll meet you there.

896
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,819
OK.

897
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,447
I'm sorry I'm like this.

898
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,155
- I dunno. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

899
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:53,322
- Don't think you have to wait. it's cold.
- No, it's fine. I'll wait.

900
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:55,114
I've got you these matches.

901
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,284
Your favourite.

902
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,336
I noticed the way you light a match.

903
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:03,043
The flame is the same shape
as a falling tear.

904
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,135
I knew then it was too late to save hen

905
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,971
She'd gone gooey in the middle.

906
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:12,177
From now on she'll buy little gifts
for her favourite teachers

907
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,684
and she'll admire the scenery
and she'll buy soup for homeless people.

908
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,725
And she'll never bum my leg here again.

909
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,272
- Maybe I will go. it's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

910
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,483
OK.

911
00:59:35,112 --> 00:59:37,114
Good night.

912
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,759
TV: Men I discovered
I could see these colours in people,

913
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,056
it took a long time because I was
in such a state of anxiety.

914
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:04,693
It was when I started to be comfortable with it
and stopped trying to resist it,

915
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,728
it started to nourish me.

916
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,317
And I could relax around it and be in it.

917
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:13,111
Then I started to make
more of an understanding of it.

918
01:00:18,405 --> 01:00:20,703
Well, it's um...

919
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,869
it's interesting.

920
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,207
He's really working that third eye, isn't he?

921
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,297
It's just a metaphor, Lloyd.

922
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,588
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's good, yes.

923
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,011
I like the whole colour coding thing.

924
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:39,222
Well, I'd like to go again.

925
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,387
I'd like you to be there, so...

926
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:47,023
- You want us to go?
- Yes, I do.

927
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:49,190
Right.

928
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:50,946
Do I have to bring shorts?

929
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:55,111
- it's on this Friday, so...
- Right, OK, yeah.

930
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,282
What, are you coming or...

931
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,039
Well, I'm intrigued, yeah.

932
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,375
- For sure.
- This Friday. This Friday.

933
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:07,585
- This Friday?
- Mm-hm.

934
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:09,623
OK, yep, Yep-

935
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:13,045
- Thank you.
- Mm.

936
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,387
Don't let me down. OK?

937
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,800
The most fantastical way
people experience the Graham T Purvis system

938
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,219
is to come to the seminar

939
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,387
Oliver, what are you doing?

940
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,441
...have been mind-blowing.
I've seen lives change.

941
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,601
It's just incredible.

942
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:35,154
I wish on a global scale
that people could get the message.

943
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,161
Wouldn 't it be just wonderful?

944
01:01:40,487 --> 01:01:42,160
Friday...

945
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,371
I'll be OK. I'll be...

946
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,287
I'll be fine. I'll be all right.

947
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,331
Yeah, I'll be OK.

948
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:51,339
Yeah.

949
01:01:58,255 --> 01:02:00,257
(Low breathing via a ventilator)

950
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,016
(Volume of breathing increases)

951
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,371
You should go in.

952
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,918
(Birdsong)

953
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,552
(Wind whistles)

954
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:37,396
Dad, aren't you going to Graham's thing?

955
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,192
- Hm?
- Graham's thing. it's Friday.

956
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,155
I thought you were going out.

957
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,447
Yeah, I'm meant to be at the hospital.

958
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,286
Well, you should get along then, I suppose.

959
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,668
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, I should go.

960
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:57,791
Right, I'm off out.

961
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,637
I'll see you, then.

962
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,507
Bye.

963
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,140
Dad, who would you save first in a house fire,

964
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,728
given the hypothetical situation

965
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,144
that both Mum and I
were equally difficult to save?

966
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,481
I'd save your mother first,

967
01:04:16,643 --> 01:04:20,318
so we had a better chance
of working together to save you.

968
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,840
Do you often feel like this?

969
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,170
Like what?

970
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,427
- Tired?
- Down in the dumps.

971
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:45,468
Quite often.

972
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,634
How long for?

973
01:04:48,675 --> 01:04:51,054
Since I was about your age, I suppose.

974
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,222
What does it feel like?

975
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,936
Like being underwater.

976
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,527
Is that why you became a marine biologist?

977
01:05:01,688 --> 01:05:03,531
Maybe, yeah.

978
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,692
Have you always liked fish?

979
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:08,904
I suppose so.

980
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:13,122
I just son of drifted into it, really.
No pun intended.

981
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,286
And does Mum mind?

982
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,456
I think she'd rather I earnt more money.

983
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,500
No, you being underwater.

984
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,588
Oh.

985
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,298
Yeah, no.

986
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,713
I'm sure she'd rather I wasn't.

987
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,508
It's not very pleasant.

988
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,556
The ocean is six miles deep, isn't it?

989
01:05:34,054 --> 01:05:36,056
Well remembered. Yeah.

990
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,690
(Phone rings)

991
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,571
Could be Mum.

992
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,606
Or Jordana.

993
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:46,821
(Phone continues ringing)

994
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,032
(Front door shuts)

995
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,462
(Phone rings)

996
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,264
(Ringing tone)

997
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:29,406
I haven 't spoken to Jordana about her mother
because there 's only two possible outcomes.

998
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,241
Either the operation was a success,

999
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:34,327
in which case she'll be too relieved
to be angry with me for long,

1000
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,617
or her mother was dead,

1001
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:38,706
in which case she needs privacy
and time to grieve.

1002
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,875
During this brief hiatus,
I can help save my parents' marriage

1003
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:46,385
and then resume my duties
as the best boyfriend in the world.

1004
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:13,737
Oliver.

1005
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:15,079
Yes?

1006
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,456
- What's this?
- I don't know.

1007
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:17,833
- What is this?
- A letter.

1008
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,835
- I don't know what's in it.
- I think you do.

1009
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,996
Why did you write this, Oliver?

1010
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,211
This isn't funny.

1011
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,751
If I did write it, and I'm not as yet
admitting that I did,

1012
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:29,090
it'd be because I spoke to Dad.
This is what he wants.

1013
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,847
- You spoke to Dad?
- He knows he's been imperfect.

1014
01:07:32,005 --> 01:07:33,598
What did you talk about, Oliver?

1015
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:35,759
Listen,

1016
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,061
he still Ends you attractive.

1017
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,222
He still wants to make love to you.

1018
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,146
Are you making this up?

1019
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,483
Me and Dad have discussed it.
We both want to make this marriage work.

1020
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,318
Are you with us?

1021
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,784
(Door shuts)

1022
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,467
(Front door slams)

1023
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,262
(Car engine starts)

1024
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,289
JILL: Going to the beach with Graham.
I will not be back tonight.

1025
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:12,735
OLIVER: On New Year's Eve,
everyone from town goes to the beach.

1026
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,493
Chip said, if a girl won't get off with you
on New Year's Eve,

1027
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,073
you may as well cut it off

1028
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:19,738
I'm starting to think that we may grow apart.

1029
01:09:20,405 --> 01:09:22,078
I don't want a mystic ninja as a stepdad.

1030
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,335
I don't want to be from a broken home
like Chip 's,

1031
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:29,000
wearing tracksuit tops instead of coats
and taking gateway drugs in shopping malls.

1032
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:30,792
I want my family back.

1033
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:32,960
I don't want anything to change.

1034
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,349
(Fireworks explode)

1035
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,643
The celebrations are really kicking in, right?

1036
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,062
Yeah.

1037
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,230
It distresses tiny animals.

1038
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:36,942
- You can relax, right?
- Mm.

1039
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,577
- There's some lovely massage oils.
- Great. OK.

1040
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,078
In you get.

1041
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,239
All right.

1042
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,162
(Fireworks explode)

1043
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,414
(Whistles from crowd on beach)

1044
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:03,050
(Mutters)

1045
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,087
I have no idea what I'm hoping to achieve
by breaking into Grahame house.

1046
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,296
I just went to give him
the idea that I'm deranged

1047
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,462
and therefore capable of anything.

1048
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,757
This will probably involve me urinating
or something.

1049
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:51,515
I need a fucking drink.

1050
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,190
(Whispers)

1051
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,072
I'm doing it. Just do it.

1052
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,858
Just do it...

1053
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,195
Just do it.

1054
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,291
OK.

1055
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:14,921
Feel my piss.

1056
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,548
Oh, come on.

1057
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:19,710
Come on.

1058
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,260
Oh, for fuck...

1059
01:12:23,421 --> 01:12:25,423
Fuck.

1060
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:27,134
It's fine.

1061
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,303
Come on. Just...

1062
01:12:30,762 --> 01:12:32,765
(Mutters)

1063
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,226
Fucking piss on your face, you fucking freak.

1064
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,440
For fuck's sake, just come on. Loosen up.

1065
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,950
Oh, here we go.

1066
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,251
(Trickle)

1067
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,205
OK, that'll do it.

1068
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,552
Jesus Christ.

1069
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,095
Fuck.

1070
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,138
(Coughs)

1071
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:16,100
(Retches)

1072
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,360
(Coughs)

1073
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,075
Kim-Lin?

1074
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:37,204
Is that you?

1075
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,374
Do you still have a key?

1076
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,669
That's very naughty.

1077
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:50,551
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

1078
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,396
What kind of protest's this, then, eh?

1079
01:13:55,805 --> 01:13:57,273
Huh?

1080
01:13:57,432 --> 01:14:00,936
How much more of this bizarre behaviour
do I have to endure?

1081
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,750
(Exhales) Nearly went red there.

1082
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,036
Come on, up you get, sweetheart.

1083
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,205
I'm just try...

1084
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,385
My name is not Kim-Lin.

1085
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:28,046
My name is Oliver Tate.

1086
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,216
(Doorbell rings)

1087
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,686
Hello.

1088
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:39,225
Hello.

1089
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,436
Hello!

1090
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,239
LLOYD: Knock, knock.

1091
01:14:54,864 --> 01:14:56,537
How are you feeling?

1092
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,578
I saw Mum with Graham at the beach.

1093
01:14:58,743 --> 01:15:00,746
Mm. Mum told me everything.

1094
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,750
Did she say she went into the van
with his face on it?

1095
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,712
Yes.

1096
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,252
Did she say what happened in the van
with his face on it?

1097
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,421
Yes.

1098
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,214
Aren't you angry?

1099
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,258
Worse things have happened at sea, OI.

1100
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,927
- What did happen?
- That's between your mother and I.

1101
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,061
JILL: Lloyd, I think it best we be honest.

1102
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,517
Sweet pea,

1103
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,682
I gave Graham a handjob.

1104
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,484
Is there anything you'd like to say about that?

1105
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,149
- Lloyd, do you want to add anything?
- No.

1106
01:15:28,314 --> 01:15:32,694
OK. Well, I was drunk
and I was trying to relax Graham.

1107
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,456
- It was a silly thing to do.
- Mm.

1108
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,164
Thank you.

1109
01:15:37,323 --> 01:15:39,326
Your father and I have discussed it

1110
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,252
and if it's OK with everyone,
that's the last we'll say about it.

1111
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,292
OK? Thank you.

1112
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:50,259
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about now, huh?

1113
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,971
Me and Jordana
are having relationship problems.

1114
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,511
- Oh.
- it's difficult.

1115
01:15:57,677 --> 01:16:00,055
I suppose it won't matter when I'm 38 but...

1116
01:16:00,221 --> 01:16:01,474
I'm upset about it.

1117
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,313
You should be more angry with her.

1118
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,478
Why would I be angry with Jordana?

1119
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:07,695
Oh, you mean me.

1120
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:09,401
Yes. No, no. Well, you know, I am.

1121
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:11,567
Yeah, I'm upset.

1122
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,779
We should go back to sleep, though.

1123
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:17,413
Yeah.

1124
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,168
We're not going to punish you now
but We're going to talk about what you've done.

1125
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,579
What about what you've done?

1126
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,122
OK, don't push it, OI.

1127
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:27,507
Well, we'll talk about that too
but you should go back to sleep now, OK?

1128
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,088
- OK.
- Mm?

1129
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:34,256
Right.

1130
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,333
JORDANA: Dear Oliver; I tried to tell you

1131
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,878
but I figure you'll only probably believe me
if it's in writing. It's over.

1132
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,012
I enclose my lighter as a parting gift for you.

1133
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:17,515
Also, I think you should know,
I've found someone else.

1134
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,894
When we're in school together,
try not to look upset.

1135
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:22,054
I know you're a good actor.

1136
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,350
PS: You were right about
my being allergic to dogs. I got tested.

1137
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:29,269
Oh, and in case you're interested,
my mum's fine now.

1138
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:31,688
Sorry if it made you feel awkward.

1139
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:41,698
ALEX TURNER:
it's Hard To Get Around The Wind

1140
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:48,463
it's like you're trying to get to heaven
in a hurry

1141
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,546
And the queue was shorter
than you thought it'd be

1142
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:57,260
And the doorman says,
You need to get a wrist band

1143
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,431
You got a lift between the pitfalls

1144
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,847
But you're looking like you're low on energy

1145
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:10,565
Did you get out and walk
to ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

1146
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,481
Could you tell her I called?

1147
01:18:13,646 --> 01:18:16,900
Looking for a new place to begin
- it's Oliver. Oliver Tate.

1148
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,740
Oh, yeah, she's got my number.

1149
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,659
Feeling like it's hard to understand

1150
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:31,548
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill

1151
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:37,095
You'll ind a way to spit it out again

1152
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:44,811
And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1153
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:53,570
it's hard to get around the wind

1154
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:55,689
None of this will matter when I'm 38.

1155
01:18:55,855 --> 01:18:58,951
But it's been two months
since Jordana last spoke to me.

1156
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,362
Her new boyfriend has an incredibly long neck.

1157
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,117
Just thinking about giraffes makes me angry.

1158
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,538
I wish I could hand in this excuse note.

1159
01:19:10,703 --> 01:19:11,829
"Dear Mr Davey,

1160
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:15,001
Please may Oliver be excused from class.
His tiny heart is broken.

1161
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,169
Yours sincerely, Lloyd Tate."

1162
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,592
Stretching out the neck on your evening

1163
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,184
Trying to even out some deficit

1164
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:29,849
But it's sabre-toothed, multi-ball confusion

1165
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,690
And you can shriek until you're hollow

1166
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:37,856
Or whisper it the other way

1167
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:43,324
Trying to save the youth
without puffing your shoes on

1168
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:50,126
Looking for a new place to begin

1169
01:19:53,037 --> 01:19:56,837
- Is he all right?
- He's fine. Just leave him.

1170
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:04,429
As long as you still keep peppering the pill

1171
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:10,021
You'll ind a way to spit it out again

1172
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:17,609
And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1173
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:23,243
it's hard

1174
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:28,158
To get around the wind

1175
01:20:28,948 --> 01:20:32,828
In my other recurring dream,
I mentally rehearse the end scene.

1176
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,965
The one where it's getting dark
and I mistake a girl for Jordana.

1177
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:39,342
A girl with the exact same frame
and the exact same hair.

1178
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,596
And when she turns around,
I see her face is nothing like Jordana's.

1179
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,882
And she asks, "Do I know you?"

1180
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,766
And I look traumatized and say...

1181
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,552
No.

1182
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,391
You don't know me.

1183
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,601
You don't know me at all.

1184
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,652
I think this will matter when I'm older,
when I'm 38.

1185
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,154
- Don't you knock any more?
- Sorry, Oliver. What?

1186
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,657
Jordana... I think it will matter when I'm older.

1187
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:03,192
Yeah, course it will.

1188
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,407
OK, well... Good night.

1189
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,832
And I can hear you through my window

1190
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:17,122
But I'm never quite sure who is who

1191
01:21:17,288 --> 01:21:22,795
But they want the world on a dessert spoon

1192
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:27,182
It always sounds like they're Fighting

1193
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,971
Or as if that's what they're about to do

1194
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,184
It might not hurt now

1195
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:36,725
But it's gonna hurt soon

1196
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:50,239
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1197
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,076
You've got to be shitting me.

1198
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:55,164
Pritchard.

1199
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,671
Pritchard, take a look at this.
it's as funny as fuck.

1200
01:21:57,829 --> 01:22:00,127
MR DUNTHORNE: All right, whose note is that?

1201
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,090
It's mine.

1202
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,970
Thank you, Oliver, for your refreshing honesty.

1203
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,355
But you know the rules.
Up you come, read it out.

1204
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:58,724
(Clears throat)

1205
01:23:00,516 --> 01:23:02,189
It was just a joke?

1206
01:23:02,351 --> 01:23:03,443
Yeah.

1207
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,483
OK, well, as I say,
if it was just a joke then that's fine.

1208
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,572
But if ever you have serious feelings

1209
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,988
of, you know, difficulty

1210
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,407
or sadness

1211
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,918
or any negative feelings that you want
to talk about, feel free to come and...

1212
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,247
I know, I know, yeah.

1213
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,707
I can talk to you about that.

1214
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,417
OK. I don't want to embarrass you

1215
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:26,586
but I just wanted you to know that
I'm open to talking whenever you want.

1216
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:27,878
Yeah. OK.

1217
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:28,886
Cool.

1218
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,423
Good.

1219
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,966
Nice one, OI. Nice one, you fuck-muppet.

1220
01:23:33,132 --> 01:23:36,103
Why write stuff like that?
Perhaps people are right and you are gay.

1221
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,310
"Jordana, I love you. I want to
have your babies, get married."

1222
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:40,519
What the fuck?

1223
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:44,436
- Fuck you, Chips.
- What the fuck are you up to, you fool?

1224
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:00,455
What?

1225
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,291
- You're a loser.
- Go and see the girl

1226
01:24:02,453 --> 01:24:04,251
- who doesn't like you.
- I'll be back.

1227
01:24:04,413 --> 01:24:06,041
I'll hit you in the face.

1228
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:13,427
Can I have a word, please, in private,
without him?

1229
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,309
I'm fine here.

1230
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,722
Sorry I didn't come to the hospital.

1231
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,559
I thought my parents were going to split up

1232
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,848
and I didn't want to look weak
or things to change.

1233
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,393
(Whispers)
My mum gave a hand-job to a mystic.

1234
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,815
Look, I was frightened.

1235
01:24:30,314 --> 01:24:32,157
I'm full of regret.

1236
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,501
This is the moment where you leave him
and come with me.

1237
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,586
Is it?

1238
01:24:47,748 --> 01:24:49,591
Yeah.

1239
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,753
Are you coming?

1240
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,633
No.

1241
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:09,945
(Chips laughs)

1242
01:25:22,658 --> 01:25:24,661
(Seagulls cry)

1243
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:11,257
I don't know if I've come of age
but I'm certainly older now.

1244
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,011
I feel shrunken, as if there's
a tiny ancient Oliver Tate inside me

1245
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,922
operating the levers of
a life-size Oliver-shaped shell.

1246
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,262
A shell on which a decrepit picture show

1247
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,427
replays the same handful of images.

1248
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:43,620
Every night I come to the same place
and wait till the sky catches up with my mood.

1249
01:26:45,324 --> 01:26:46,792
The pattern is set.

1250
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:50,331
This is, no doubt, the end.

1251
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,355
Jordana!

1252
01:27:17,314 --> 01:27:19,032
Jordana!

1253
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,114
It is you.

1254
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,500
I didn't think it'd be you. I...

1255
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:30,829
I thought it'd be like a Elm
where the girl turns round and it's not the...

1256
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:32,542
You've got a new dog. You're allergic.

1257
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,208
- Oliver.
- Where's your boyfriend?

1258
01:27:34,373 --> 01:27:35,670
He's not my boyfriend.

1259
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,552
Your skin's looking bad, terrible.
it's probably the dog.

1260
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,510
I don't care about my fucking skin.

1261
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:43,766
- Why on earth did you get a new dog?
- Because I like dogs, OK?

1262
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,518
Why are you such a total dick?

1263
01:27:45,676 --> 01:27:47,679
I don't know.

1264
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:51,182
I was crying earlier. My eyes are probably red.

1265
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:52,395
They look fine.

1266
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,653
No, well, maybe they don't go red when I cry.

1267
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:56,813
It happens to some.

1268
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,367
You were horrible to me.

1269
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,905
I know. I made a mistake.

1270
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:08,621
I made a mistake.
What do you want me to say?

1271
01:28:13,662 --> 01:28:15,289
- Ask me how deep the ocean is.
- Shut up.

1272
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,503
Go on, just ask me.

1273
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,087
- Why?
- Because I know the answer.

1274
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:19,969
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah. I do.

1275
01:28:20,127 --> 01:28:21,549
- How deep?
- I'm not going to say.

1276
01:28:21,712 --> 01:28:23,715
I'm broken-hearted.

1277
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:26,976
- The ocean is six miles deep.
- Good.

1278
01:30:18,829 --> 01:30:20,832
ALEX TURNER: Piledriver Waltz

1279
01:30:36,805 --> 01:30:39,934
I etched the face of a stopwatch

1280
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,320
On the back of a raindrop

1281
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:46,107
And did a swap for the sand

1282
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:49,278
In an hourglass

1283
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:53,615
I heard an unhappy ending

1284
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,956
It sort of sounds like you leaving

1285
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:00,338
I heard the Piledriver Waltz

1286
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:03,876
It woke me up this morning

1287
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,764
You look like you've been for breakfast

1288
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:17,055
At the Heartbreak Hotel

1289
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:18,894
And sat in the back booth

1290
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:23,938
By the pamphlets and the literature

1291
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:25,650
On how to lose

1292
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:29,864
Your waitress was miserable

1293
01:31:30,025 --> 01:31:32,119
And so was your food

1294
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:34,747
If you're going to try and walk on water

1295
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:36,202
Make sure you wear

1296
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:40,121
Your comfortable shoes

1297
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,506
Mysteries flashing amber

1298
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:46,087
Go green when you answer

1299
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:50,346
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire

1300
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,725
Never changes

1301
01:31:53,882 --> 01:31:57,136
I heard the news that you're planning

1302
01:31:57,302 --> 01:32:00,523
To shoot me out of a cannon

1303
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,935
I heard the Piledriver Waltz

1304
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:09,278
It woke me up this morning

1305
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:17,408
You look like you've been for breakfast

1306
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:20,622
At the Heartbreak Hotel

1307
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:22,627
And sat in the back booth

1308
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:27,543
By the pamphlets and the literature

1309
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,836
On how to lose

1310
01:32:30,002 --> 01:32:33,256
Your waitress was miserable

1311
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:35,720
And so was your food

1312
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,136
If you're going to try

1313
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,554
And walk on water

1314
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,846
Make sure you wear

1315
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:43,813
Your comfortable shoes

1316
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,312
Oh-oh-oh

1317
01:32:47,936 --> 01:32:51,190
The Piledriver

1318
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:28,144
ALEX TURNER: Stuck On The Puzzle

1319
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:40,206
I'm not the kind of fool

1320
01:33:40,364 --> 01:33:43,743
Who's going to sit and sing to you

1321
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:48,248
About stars, girl

1322
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:51,668
But last night I looked up into

1323
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:54,884
The dark half of the blue

1324
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,430
And they'd gone backwards

1325
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:02,561
Something in your magnetism

1326
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,189
Must have pissed them off

1327
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:10,900
Forcing them to get an early night

1328
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:17,278
I have been searching
from the bottom to the top

1329
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:20,070
For such a sight

1330
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:23,661
As the one I caught when I saw

1331
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:29,206
Your fingers dimming the lights

1332
01:34:30,122 --> 01:34:35,094
Like you're used to being told
that you're trouble

1333
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:41,684
And I spent all night

1334
01:34:42,217 --> 01:34:45,266
Stuck on the puzzle

1335
01:34:49,516 --> 01:34:51,109
Nobody I asked

1336
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,567
Knew how we came to be

1337
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:56,107
The one to who

1338
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:59,699
You surrendered

1339
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:03,953
Any man who wasn't led away

1340
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:06,993
Into the other room

1341
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:11,005
Stood pretending

1342
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:13,916
That something in your magnetism

1343
01:35:14,082 --> 01:35:16,460
Hadn’t just made him drop

1344
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,135
Whoever's hand it was

1345
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,799
That he was holding

1346
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,682
I have been searching

1347
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:28,439
From the bottom to the top

1348
01:35:28,597 --> 01:35:31,476
For such a sight

1349
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:34,895
As the one I caught when I saw

1350
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:40,319
Your fingers dimming the lights

1351
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:43,822
Like you're used to being told

1352
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,990
That you're trouble

1353
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:53,001
And I spent all night

1354
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:56,216
Stuck on the puzzle

1355
01:35:59,753 --> 01:36:04,680
I tried to swim to the side

1356
01:36:06,426 --> 01:36:10,853
But my feet got caught in the middle

1357
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:17,189
And I thought I'd seen the light

1358
01:36:18,146 --> 01:36:20,149
But, oh, no

1359
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:26,744
I was just stuck on the puzzle

1360
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:34,715
Stuck on the puzzle
