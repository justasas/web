mastering the art of kung foo it was an
ancient prophecy about a new form of

bigging miss the ponies track

67
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,709
I need someone to trace that call but
that's impossible

68
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,910
not for me it isn't

69
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,340
anchorman

70
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,339
he's the most powerful actor of all time

71
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,639
follow me

72
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:39,480
i was able to triangulate the cell phone
single trace to call her his name is

73
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,610
Adolf Hitler Hitler is two words
criminal of all time

74
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,539
do you know him Sir I guess you could
say that in the nineteen forties

75
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,180
if there was a good food champion he was
so good at kung foo that he decided to

76
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,339
change his name to come get her

77
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,710
but it didn't stop there he knew the
computer prophecy wanted to claim from

78
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,769
so he and his party of Nazi soldiers

79
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,769
conducted experiments for years

80
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,179
yeah

81
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:17,819
yeah

82
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,500
we weren't able to figure out how to
master the art of kung fury

83
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,440
that one day it disappeared from the
piece of the earth and no one has seen

84
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,530
him ever since until now

85
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,610
I guess he figured if we could find a
chosen one and kill him he will become

86
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,930
confused himself he must have traveled
in time in order to get here is probably

87
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,849
why I disappeared in the first place

88
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,850
so what are you gonna do my job

89
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm gonna go back in time to not Germany
and kill it that once and for all

90
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,840
so

91
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,610
how are you gonna do that I'm not sure I
need some sort of time machine

92
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,889
wait a minute

93
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,059
using an RX modulator I might be able to
connect the mainframe sell my right and

94
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,609
hacked up into the download with our
list at me

95
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,730
it means that with the right computer
algorithms I can hack your back in time

96
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,190
just like a time machine

97
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,340
