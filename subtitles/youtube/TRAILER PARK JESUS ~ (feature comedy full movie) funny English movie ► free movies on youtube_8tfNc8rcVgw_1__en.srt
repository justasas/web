1
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,367
Jessie, I don't think we should date anymore.

2
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:44,222
What?

3
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:46,042
I don't think we should date anymore.

4
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:46,833
Why?

5
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,593
Look, it's summer break. It's time for a transition.

6
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:52,125
But we were supposed to go to the movies tonight.

7
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,378
Sarah?

8
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:56,108
I just don't think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,480
But, I love-

10
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,701
No you don't.

11
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,856
I've always said you were too nice. You need to be meaner.

12
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:26,810
It's my nature. I can't be mean.

13
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,944
Perhaps with that acid you just bought, you could reprogram yourself.

14
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,468
Wait, what acid?

15
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:36,006
Jessie bought a sheet of acid after Sarah broke up with him.

16
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,573
Isn't that like fifty hits?

17
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:40,293
One hundred.

18
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:47,400
How much did it cost?

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,242
Four hundred dollars for the whole sheet. He said it was a friend of a friend discount. I just had

20
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:53,709
to promise I wasn't dealing.

21
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:54,816
Are you dealing it?

22
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,647
No. I'm just sharing it with some friends back in St Louis.

23
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,031
My buddy's friend took a dose for Mardi Gras and he disappeared.

24
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,123
Disappeared? For real?

25
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:16,625
He painted his face half black, half white, like down the center.

26
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:26,145
He erupted, like stopped talking. And then he walked off.

27
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,206
Where did he go?

28
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,103
He just, disappeared.

29
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:31,514
Why are you all trying to freak me out?

30
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:34,145
So you're careful with that LSD.

31
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:45,854
How about sharing it with some friends here? Will you sell me a fish? And Maya. Oh, just sell one

32
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:47,097
each to us.

33
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:51,736
Each fish is 4 hits. I don't want to run out.

34
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,119
I don't want any.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,493
You're not going to run out.

36
00:02:55,493 --> 00:03:00,377
I'll give you 2 fish. I'm not a dealer though.

37
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:10,973
Why are you giving me this?

38
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:11,562
Let's take it.

39
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:14,849
No way. I have a final left tomorrow afternoon.

40
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:21,848
Come on. It's twenty hours away and this will only last like 9 hours. Maybe ten.

41
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:22,837
No way.

42
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,974
Do you guys have a cigarette?

43
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,836
No, I don't smoke.

44
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:42,697
Hello?

45
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:49,658
Hi, mom. Yeah, I just crossed over Lake Ponchatrain. I'm going to get off I-55 at Jackson and

46
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:55,832
get on route 61. I just need to get some extra time to unwind on the road. I think it would be fun

47
00:03:55,832 --> 00:04:00,908
to take the old highway. I know about the stoplights. Nobody's going to murder me. No, they're

48
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:05,500
not going to bury me in an earthen dam. You've got to stop watching those documentaries, mom.

49
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,213
Ok, I think I'm going to get off now.

50
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:15,218
No, get off the phone, not the road. Ok, I promise if I get tired I'll stop at a motel. Alright. I love

51
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,564
you. Bye.

52
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,490
Hello?

53
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,695
Hi, Sarah.

54
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:40,558
No, I'm driving. I didn't see your text.

55
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,961
Um.

56
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:48,819
Home. Back to St. Louis. You told me you didn't want to see me anymore. You broke up with

57
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:56,639
me during sex. We're not broken up? We are? Yes, I still want to be friends. Ok, I'm sorry I

58
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,382
didn't say goodbye.

59
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,694
Goodbye.

60
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:14,125
I hate myself. Jessie you gotta be stronger. You're weak! Be tough! Nice. Doesn't. Work. Fuck!

61
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:18,544
Fuck!

62
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,017
Hello.

63
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,526
Whatcha doin?

64
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,959
I'm just looking for something to eat.

65
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,512
No-no-no. What are you doin?

66
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:57,269
I'm having a bad day and driving to see my family.

67
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,729
You talk like you're from a big city.

68
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,205
We'll it's bigger than this but, it's nothin-

69
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,940
You don't like my city?

70
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,122
I didn't say that-

71
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:10,575
It was the way you said it... Chief.

72
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:13,230
I'm just gonna look for something to eat.

73
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,377
Get me somethin'.

74
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:16,411
What?

75
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,088
Somethin' to eat.

76
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:22,382
Here. Buy me this.

77
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:25,320
And... this.

78
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:34,571
And this. You'll like this. I like it. We'll both like it.

79
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,211
But, I've never eaten pork rinds before.

80
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:38,733
Yeah, you have.

81
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:39,658
No, I haven't.

82
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,788
They're good.

83
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,628
I can't buy you anything else.

84
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,569
That's all I want.

85
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:50,026
Buy me a drink.

86
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:52,294
Okay.

87
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:05,158
No, I can't buy you anything else.

88
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,176
That's it.

89
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:11,072
No, I'm not gonna pay for what you just put on the counter there.

90
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:12,262
Why not?

91
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:16,406
Because I told you I wasn't gonna buy you anything else when we were standing over there.

92
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:18,325
Oh.

93
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:21,884
And I'm not buying you anything else.

94
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:25,463
No, not the bag of fish.

95
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,394
It's on the counter.

96
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:28,961
He put it there, not me. Do you know him?

97
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,918
She's my cousin.

98
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,196
Ok, so who's putting the fish back?

99
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:36,177
I'm not. He put it there.

100
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:45,669
Hey. City boy. Someone's been hanging around the old schoolhouse. You should come over.

101
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:47,853
I really gotta hit the road. Sorry.

102
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:51,811
Behind the schoolhouse. Be there.

103
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,049
He's not my cousin.

104
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:00,692
Thank you.

105
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,293
What the fuck?

106
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:27,985
We've been working on your car.

107
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,120
Preventative maintenance.

108
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,702
Did you guys move any of the wires, or mess with the engine or anything?

109
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:37,596
No. Just cleaning.

110
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:41,114
Yeah, we're not the mechanics. They are.

111
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,989
I haven't been talking to them. Maya has.

112
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,944
No, I'm not taking these. I have to get up to St. Louis tonight.

113
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:05,073
Just wait a day, and chill with us.

114
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,264
No, my family and friends are expecting me to arrive tonight.

115
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:13,971
Keep them, seriously. I'm only going to get into trouble.

116
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,466
Let's hear you turn her over.

117
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,402
What?

118
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,651
She said, 'let's hear you turn her over'.

119
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,826
Alright, let's hear you start her up.

120
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,235
Start her up! Let's hear what you got.

121
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,620
Well, it's not turning over, that's the thing.

122
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,345
Whooooohooooweee, what a nice lookin' car.

123
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:34,383
Oh yeah, my uncle had a car like this. My cousin, he bought it off him one day to use in the

124
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:39,432
derby. Ooooooh they did smash him up! This here car is real solid.

125
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:42,326
I said, it was a nice lookin' car.

126
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,293
You from Missouri?

127
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,273
Yeah, Missouri.

128
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:46,622
Misery?

129
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,711
Yeah. St. Louis, Missouri.

130
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,186
A city boy.

131
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:54,884
City boy, what'ch you doin out here?

132
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,273
Just drivin' home.

133
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,973
Ciiiiiitttty boooooy

134
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,877
I live way out of the city, like near farms.

135
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:04,131
C-C-C-cit-cit-cit-city-city boy

136
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,095
Start your engine.

137
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:08,552
Okay.

138
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,308
Pump the gas.

139
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:31,300
No, no no no, you'll flood your engine. Hold down the gas.

140
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:39,723
Sounds like there's somethin jammin' up your engine.

141
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:56,145
How the fuck did this get into your air filter?

142
00:11:56,144 --> 00:12:00,821
What the fuck!?  Those mother-fuckers. I'm fucked!

143
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,396
Chillax dude.

144
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:07,695
Hey ya'll, this detour's over man. Let's continue with our Sunday fun day.

145
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:09,854
Aw yeah, we got to go.

146
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,764
Sorry babe.

147
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,915
Bye.

148
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:19,176
Chief, I gotta go. Just get all your little sex toys outta the air filter and put the cap back on. If

149
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:22,792
you need me, you wanna hang out and play music, just come around back to the trailer park.

150
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,236
Can you take us to the tree of life?

151
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:46,633
Ugh, the tree of life! Thank you Jessie.

152
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,816
You from Missouri?

153
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:53,427
Yep. Missouri. It's a small town near the Mississippi river.

154
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:58,072
Hey, we ain't far from Mississippi neither. I'm Paul.

155
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:59,471
I'm Jessie.

156
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,687
And I am Luke.

157
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,663
It's a sweet ride, what's wrong with her?

158
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,875
Somebody put beads and shit in my engine.

159
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,528
In the gas tank?

160
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:14,356
No, the air filter.

161
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:17,177
That's weird. Let's turn her over.

162
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:19,072
Hey, I'm gonna go get some A/C man.

163
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:21,040
Alright. Hey, don't mess with my cousin.

164
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,734
I won't.

165
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,573
Hey, so turn it over.

166
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,923
Hey, you see, that's why you're not supposed to put Mardi Gras beads in your air filter. It's a

167
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:35,409
good thing I got to you first Missouri. Them bad boys would invite you behind the old school.

168
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:37,153
The old school?

169
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:39,298
That's where they bash folks heads in and takes their money.

170
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:40,596
What?

171
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:44,870
Sometimes they don't take their money, they just bash their heads in for sport. Let's go check

172
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,370
the fuse box.

173
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,988
What about the police? What do they do about the bashing?

174
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:00,196
Police avoid this place unless something exciting happens.

175
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:06,983
Yep, this car ain't gonna start. It looks like someone got to your fuses and your wires too.

176
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,702
Well this isn't good.

177
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:09,716
No, it ain't.

178
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,265
Great.

179
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:14,730
It ain't that bad Missouri.

180
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,426
My mom is gonna kill me.

181
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:18,311
You goin' to see your mom in Missouri?

182
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:22,182
Yeah, she told me not to get off the interstate.

183
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:26,947
See, I don't listen to my mom neither. She's a mean bitch.

184
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:32,548
Well, my mom is not really that mean. She's just always gettin' in my business and I fuckin hate

185
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,526
it when she's right.

186
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:35,435
Where you drivin' in from?

187
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:36,971
New Orleans.

188
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:43,251
New Orleans, Bourbon Street! Boozin' it out, smokin' that weed, girls showin' their titties for

189
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:45,376
beads, right? Titties for beads.

190
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:49,596
Well, there's more to New Orleans than just Bourbon Street. I only went to Bourbon my

191
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,925
freshman year.

192
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:53,596
Fresh, for what?

193
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,301
College, I go to college in New Orleans.

194
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,733
Got any weed?

195
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,684
No, sorry.

196
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:05,657
Damn. I knew you were smart when I saw you in this SUV. Wish I could visit New Orleans.

197
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,923
It's really not that far.

198
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:12,507
I ain't got no money to travel. Jackson's an hour away. I ain't never been there.

199
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:15,603
It doesn't cost much money. Just get in the car and go.

200
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,298
That's exactly what a rich kid would say.

201
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,110
I'm not rich!

202
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,283
It's a nice ride.

203
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,798
This car isn't that ride. Everybody in my school drives much nicer things than this.

204
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,082
This is a nice car

205
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,917
'Til it broke down.

206
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,297
That's true. Is there a car shop around here?

207
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:36,553
Not on Sunday. I can get it towed. My buddy owns a wrecker.

208
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:39,524
Can I borrow your phone?

209
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,370
I ain't got no phone, chief. Guess you ain't rich.

210
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,157
I have a phone, it just broke.

211
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,774
You are rich.

212
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:51,566
I'm not rich! You know where I can find a phone?

213
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:55,571
My cousin works in the store, she'll let you use the phone, she's real nice.

214
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:58,993
Okay, I'll ask her. Thank you.

215
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:14,809
Hi, my car broke down outside and your cousin suggested I come in and ask to use your phone.

216
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,008
He's not my cousin.

217
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:21,050
No, not the guy who conned me into buying all that stuff. Paul.

218
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:25,118
You know your cousin Paul, that stupid fucker.

219
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:30,305
Oh, no, Paul's my cousin. I don't know how but, oh he's married to my cousin Mary or

220
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:31,527
somethin'.

221
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:32,509
So, can I use the phone?

222
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,414
I'm already over my limit but you can use the store's phone.

223
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,975
Well, it's long distance.

224
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:43,825
So don't go over a minute. But, you know what, don't because my boss will kill me if he sees

225
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:47,080
the charge. Use my phone but don't go over a minute, okay?

226
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay, thank you. Hi mom, no everything's fine, I'm just callin' to let you know that my car

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,067
broke down in Mississippi. Yeah, everyone's real nice.

228
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,701
I won't be if you go over a minute.

229
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:07,923
Come on, my phone.

230
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:12,814
Look, I'm just calling to let you know I'm gonna be late. I'll probably have to leave the car to

231
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:18,796
get repaired and - no don't worry- okay, love you.

232
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:22,889
Thanks.

233
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,772
That was sweet, tellin' your mom you love her.

234
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,983
I guess.

235
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:29,106
Well, what you gonna do?

236
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:32,591
I need to find a way back to Missouri.

237
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,211
Misery?

238
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:39,702
Missouri. Is there a car rental place or a bus station or train depot?

239
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:43,576
Yeah, there's a bus station. It's, I've taken it before.

240
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,502
Where is it?

241
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,682
The other end of town.

242
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,730
How would I check the schedule?

243
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,153
You could call 'em. Here, it's already programmed into my phone.

244
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,183
Thanks.

245
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:18,666
Hi, I was wondering if there's a bus leaving Cleveland, Mississippi to St. Louis. Yeah, tonight.

246
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:26,806
8pm. Okay, can I buy my tickets there? Okay great, thank you.

247
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,443
It's all good?

248
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:34,317
Yeah, it's all good. What did you say your name was?

249
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,330
Sara.

250
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:38,976
What?

251
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:43,056
That's my ex-girlfriends name. We just broke up.

252
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,208
Oh, I'm sorry honey, that sucks.

253
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,619
The whole car break down thing has really distracted me from all that stuff, so.

254
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:53,692
What's your name?

255
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:57,585
Oh, it's Jessie. Thanks again for the phone and everything.

256
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:00,119
And it's Sara without an h.

257
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:05,280
Oh, that's better. All the evil Sarah's spell it with an h. Thanks again.

258
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,616
Boy, he did a number on this.

259
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,293
My cousin let you use the phone?

260
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,232
Yeah, she did. She was real nice.

261
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:17,139
She's a whore.

262
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,048
What? Dude that's your cousin.

263
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:22,508
Don't you think I know?

264
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:27,288
So anyway, I just talked to my mom and she's freaking out. I need to get back to Missouri

265
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,222
today.

266
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:32,149
Well it's gonna be somethin'. It's gonna be some trick gettin' this car started.

267
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna leave it here to get repaired.

268
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,713
Have somebody to pick you up?

269
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:45,724
No, I don't have anybody to pick me up. What I'm wondering is -well I'm wondering- if you

270
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:50,209
could get your buddy to tow my car to his shop and then you can take me to the bus station.

271
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,364
Oh, I can get your car towed, but I ain't got no way of puttin' you at the station.

272
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:57,238
Someway, any way man. You're the only guy around here I trust.

273
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,990
Ah that's nice of you to say Missouri. You have my mom to thank for that. She beat it into me.

274
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,750
Not with a belt, with the Lord.

275
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,955
Okay, I know I don't have any weed to trade, but-

276
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,953
I like weed.

277
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:09,137
I do have this.

278
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:14,907
You wanna trade me a scrap of paper?

279
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,646
No, it's acid.

280
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:21,933
Acid-acid? Like in that Dennis Hopper movie where they ride the motorcycles in the cemetery?

281
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,180
Exactly.

282
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,711
Maybe I could get Luke to get you a ride. Can you get one for him?

283
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,259
Yeah!

284
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,736
We gonna get you to the bus station, Missouri!

285
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:28,911
Awesome, thank you!

286
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,955
Oh Jessie, we gonna have us some real fun man!

287
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:52,478
So, you will bring me to the bus station?

288
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:56,882
Ah, I dunno. I am kind of busy, you know.

289
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,027
Man, you ain't busy.

290
00:20:58,027 --> 00:21:01,987
Am too. I'm still trainin' for my next fight.

291
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,823
Quit Fuckin' with Missouri.

292
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:06,871
Shit yeah I'll drive you man, I wanna try some of that shit.

293
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:08,147
Can we have it right now?

294
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,509
No, that's not a good idea.

295
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,502
Why not?

296
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:12,677
Cause it's really strong.

297
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:13,798
How you mean?

298
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:15,580
You know my friends who took it last night?

299
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,205
Uh-huh.

300
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:18,281
They're the ones who put the beads and shit in my engine.

301
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:21,377
Oh, don't worry Missouri, it's cool!

302
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:23,924
No, you guys will really drive off the road!

303
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:28,250
Relax Missouri. I am a terrific driver.

304
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,825
He is.

305
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,528
I don't know.

306
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:35,520
Okay. Luke, we're just gonna have to wait a minute. Let's get everything loaded into Luke's

307
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,407
car. We're gonna get you to the bus station.

308
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,836
Where should I take it?

309
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,877
My house. Follow me.

310
00:21:56,325 --> 00:22:00,203
Let me close that up for you there Missouri so nobody sticks anymore teddy bears in there.

311
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:03,875
All set.

312
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,256
Let's go.

313
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,896
Thank you.

314
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:18,962
Well, here she is. My kingdom.

315
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,886
He's real proud.

316
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,288
Yes, I am.

317
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:31,403
I'll get, I got it Missouri.

318
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:34,230
I'll be right back, ya'll. I'm gonna get somethin' from my trailer.

319
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,064
Alright.

320
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:43,964
Hey Missourah, you need to meet my wife. Come on, I'll introduce you.

321
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,513
Luke said he was just gonna be a second.

322
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:48,778
This will only take a second. Hey, how often do we meet a city boy?

323
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:50,210
I still gotta get to the bus station.

324
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,902
We're gonna get you to the station. Come on, you'll like her. She's a peach.

325
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:01,327
Alright kids, snack time. Snack time.

326
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:13,796
Mary! Oh, don't even pay this no mind. We don't even have a dog. Mary! Hey, where's Mary?

327
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,191
Mary, where's my sweetness?

328
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:18,024
Are y'all about to fight? Who is that?

329
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:23,623
That's Missouri. This is my sister Rose Marie. She and all her kids live in our trailer.

330
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:25,092
Hi.

331
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:25,903
Where's Mary?

332
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:32,097
Y'all are about to fight. Alright, come on, get in back kids. Back of the trailer. Go, move it. Go.

333
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,796
Eatin' all my munchy foods.

334
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:40,449
One on the way, we're not even sure if it's hers. No, not sure.  There she is.

335
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:41,301
What do you want Paul?

336
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,201
Hey, baby.

337
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:43,107
Who the fuck is that?

338
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,384
I wanted to introduce you to my friend.

339
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,462
Does he have a name?

340
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:49,582
Missourah. We've been callin' him Missourah 'cause that's where he's from.

341
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:50,788
My name is Jessie.

342
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:54,758
Hi, Jessie. What the fuck are you doin' here?

343
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:58,476
Well, my car broke down and Paul is-

344
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:02,752
Mary, this is our guest, why are you bein' such a bitch?

345
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,462
Bitch? Imma show you bitch. Y'all get the fuck out of my trailer.

346
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,185
Whoa, Mary, what did Jessie do to you?

347
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:15,986
Jessie did not do anything to me. It is you randomly bringing strangers into our home. I'm sorry

348
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:17,375
Jessie.

349
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,599
Really, it's okay. Paul's just gonna take me to the bus station and then I'll be gone.

350
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,639
No baby I'm sorry, because I'm projecting my anger for Paul towards you.

351
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,367
Projectin'? Mary what's that all about? I don't even know what that means.

352
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:36,530
It means I'm directin' my anger towards you, towards poor little Jessie, here. And for that, I

353
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,010
apologize.

354
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,917
No worries, really, it's ok. Really.

355
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:43,553
Look I'm takin' him to the bus station and then you don't ever have to see him again okay?

356
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:49,316
Okay, no you makin' me out to be the big bitch and that is not me. See what you turn me into? It

357
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:54,108
was nice to meet you Jessie.

358
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:55,960
Likewise.

359
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,133
That's my wife.

360
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,206
Hey, Mary!

361
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,799
You need to stay away from my husband.

362
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,453
Acid, please.

363
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:12,686
After the bus station.

364
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:14,773
No, now.

365
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,922
What you talkin' about Mary?

366
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:21,684
That kid in there, Jessie. You better not be plannin' on robbin' him.

367
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:26,106
Now listen Mary, we ain't doin' nothin' but takin' that kid to the bus station, you hear?

368
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:30,309
Yeah, well this was a nice place until you moved in here.

369
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,770
Mary, how're you gonna say that to me? I'm a good person.

370
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,475
Yeah.

371
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:45,230
That's just unfair. Ya'll ready?

372
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,072
Yeah, we're ready.

373
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,607
In a minute. The acid, please.

374
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,611
I really don't think it's a good idea to take it right now.

375
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,489
I understand your concerns Missouri, but if you want a ride city boy, you're gonna have to give

376
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,704
us what you promised.

377
00:26:56,704 --> 00:26:57,500
Yup.

378
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,714
It's just really strong. I don't think you'll be able to drive.

379
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:01,933
No, for sure, we'll get you there.

380
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,103
I just really need to get to the bus station.

381
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,484
Is it really that terrible to give us the acid before we leave?

382
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:11,018
No, but my concern is ya'll will take it and trip out and won't be able to drive me.

383
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:17,188
Now, from what I understand, it does take a couple of hours for it to hit.

384
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:18,201
I heard it was an instant.

385
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,077
No, man.

386
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:20,706
Almost an instant?

387
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:21,744
Almost.

388
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:25,911
I've never taken it but according to my friends it takes about 30 minutes.

389
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:29,535
Well there you go, the bus station's only about ten minutes away. That's perfect.

390
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,885
Come on.

391
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:41,520
Do you have a scissors?

392
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,253
Well sure, I can find some.  Rose Marie where your kids put them scissors at? Oh, bingo.

393
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,900
Here you go. Careful, sharp.

394
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,602
Look at that little fish.

395
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,045
There you go.

396
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:03,583
Here's one.

397
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,853
My turn.

398
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:05,813
Put it on your tongue like that.

399
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:06,520
Like that?

400
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,191
Like that. There you go.

401
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,348
You're not takin' one?

402
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:16,018
No, I mean I'm gonna be hangin' out at the bus station all day.

403
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:18,557
Come on now, Missouri.

404
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:19,383
Yeah, come on.

405
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:20,049
Come on.

406
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,046
Come on, man.

407
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,432
Come on.

408
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:23,538
It'll be fun!

409
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:24,450
Come on.

410
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,980
Okay, I'll take half.

411
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,769
He gonna take half.

412
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:32,100
Save some for later. There you go. Nice, alright.

413
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,211
Alright, on three we're gonna do it together.

414
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,136
Alright.

415
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:39,511
One, two, three.

416
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,851
The bus station, please.

417
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:44,085
Let's go.

418
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:45,016
Let's go.

419
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:50,751
Gotta perm my maw-maw's hair tonight, but I'm gonna hit you up.

420
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:51,914
Hey, hey, hey, where ya'll headed?

421
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:54,057
Takin' Missouri to the bus station, like I told you.

422
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:56,125
Why ya'll look like you got into somethin'?

423
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,673
Nothin' got us into.

424
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,476
I just need to get home.

425
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:04,513
Well when you get bad you need to clean up your fuckin' mess in our home. Excuse the

426
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:06,019
language, Jessie.

427
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,877
No worries, nice meeting you.

428
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:11,895
See how sweet he is? Paul. Polite.

429
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:19,187
Fuck Mary, why you always gotta be bustin' my nuts? Bye.

430
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:21,634
I hate this place.

431
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,417
I despise this place.

432
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:30,330
I dunno it seems nice. All the neighbors are friendly. My neighbors ignore me back home.

433
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,151
Sounds better than this crap old life.

434
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:34,399
Yup.

435
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:26,009
It looks closed.

436
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:32,317
Maybe they're tryna-they got the lights off-tryna save electricity or somethin'.

437
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,899
Or hiding.

438
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,830
Why would they be hidin'?

439
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,709
I don't know. A surprise of some sorts.

440
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,944
Why?

441
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,628
I'm gonna go check it out.

442
00:30:56,368 --> 00:31:01,254
I know you've seen the movie. It's got Dennis Hopper and that guys been in everything. He was

443
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:05,228
in that scary movie where he comes to the door -that marine movie with Tom Cruise- we

444
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:07,623
watched that at Jezzabel's trailer.

445
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:09,250
Yeah.

446
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,749
Wasn't that you that hooked up with Jezzabel?

447
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:12,596
I always hook up with Jezzabel.

448
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:13,595
Right?

449
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:21,693
Okay, so slight problem. It only opens 30 minutes before the bus departs.

450
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,821
Well what time's your bus leave?

451
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:25,532
Eight-oh-clock.

452
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:27,048
Well it's only noon now.

453
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:29,184
Just hang with us, we'll bring you back.

454
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:33,392
Yeah, come on. It'll be fun man.

455
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,948
Okay.

456
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,377
Get in the car.

457
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:49,567
Luke, I'm startin' to feel it.

458
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,004
You are?

459
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:53,083
The pavement is shimmerin'.

460
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:56,006
Oh man, I wanna feel it too!

461
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,627
Maybe I should just wait here.

462
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:03,748
No man, it's like seven hours away. Come with us, we'll get you there.

463
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:05,884
There's no way you can drive in seven hours.

464
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:14,166
I can drive after drinkin' two six-packs, and smokin' some weed.

465
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:20,386
I can see blowin' wheat, in the gravel.

466
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:33,903
Holy shit! My windshield just disappeared. No man, it's still there. That was weird.

467
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:36,294
It's really comfortable back here.

468
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:55,497
It is? Hold on switch seats with me. No, I liked it better up front. Wait, it is comfortable.

469
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:58,467
Wow, there isn't a windshield.

470
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:02,795
Don't hit it. Just touch it.

471
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:06,022
Wow, this is cool.

472
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:08,195
My hair feels weird.

473
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,476
Your hair is weird.

474
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:11,890
You should take your other half.

475
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,483
I should.

476
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:17,291
Let's roll boys.

477
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:28,002
You were right, you were right Jessie. It's so good. You're gonna be okay.

478
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:35,318
He is right, you are our new friend.

479
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:40,048
I'm glad, you're nice guys.

480
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:41,154
We are nice guys.

481
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:45,622
That's what I've been tryna tell everybody. You pretend like you're me.

482
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:53,168
Hi everybody, I've been workin' all day. Makin the engines. Whoa!

483
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,384
Fuck you man!

484
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:57,366
What're you honkin' at? We didn't do anything to you.

485
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:59,243
Takin' acid, and havin' fun.

486
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,909
Watch the road! Where you goin'?

487
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,518
Don't open that, it's bad luck!

488
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:40,648
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa. You're drivin' like a bat outta hell. This your new boy?

489
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:41,784
He is indeed.

490
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:42,997
What's his name?

491
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:44,199
Missouri.

492
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,829
Jessie.

493
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,014
Welcome Jessie.

494
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,547
Thank you.

495
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:48,907
You came back.

496
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:51,842
Alright, alright, alright. Move ya'll. We gotta go to Paul's trailer.

497
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,012
Bye baby.

498
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:53,938
Bye.

499
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:12,236
Whoa, whoa, we're here.

500
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,146
I'm sorry Paul.

501
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:41,990
I'm alright.  Hey cuz, you off work early?

502
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,275
Yeah, I was just fillin' in for Susie.

503
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,732
Ah, that's good.

504
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,019
What's he doin' here?

505
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:46,952
Missouri?

506
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:48,351
Jessie. Hey Jessie.

507
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:50,291
Hey Sara, without an h.

508
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,266
You wanna play against me?

509
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,690
Cool. What game is this?

510
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,869
Ultimate Fighterman

511
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:29,902
What's he still doin' here?

512
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:34,179
Missouri? Bus stations closed.

513
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,955
We can't take in anymore people.

514
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:40,834
Ah be nice, the station's gonna open 30 minutes before the bus leaves.

515
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,299
When does the bus leave?

516
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,918
The bus departs at 8 P.M.

517
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,329
Ya'll went and got drunk?

518
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:51,567
We ain't drunk, we just in a good mood.

519
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:52,481
Why?

520
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:57,585
Because we get to spend more time with our new friend Missouri.

521
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,291
You are all messed up. Outside.

522
00:37:08,702 --> 00:37:10,775
Hey, how'd you get out here?

523
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:13,340
I have no idea man.

524
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,717
That is really green.

525
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:25,159
Ow, dick!

526
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,770
Hey look, green, green, green, green, rocks.

527
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:30,629
Oh, that's purtty.

528
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:33,005
You guys aren't drunk?

529
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:35,474
If I move fast enough, look I can move faster than the stick, see?

530
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:36,969
You aren't drunk?

531
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:39,134
No.

532
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:39,697
Nope.

533
00:37:39,697 --> 00:37:40,521
No.

534
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:43,360
Then what kind of shit did you get into?

535
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,563
Acid.

536
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:48,441
LSD acid? How the fuck did you get into acid?

537
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:52,209
Whoa, go get 'em.

538
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:55,384
I'm getting' 'em. To the head!

539
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:56,668
Do you know how to ultimate fight?

540
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:59,428
I'm doin' it baby.

541
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,179
No, in real life.

542
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:06,141
No, I don't do any kind of fighting.

543
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,764
Luke's an ultimate fighter.

544
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,355
Luke's an ultimate fighter?

545
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:34,622
You ever seen patterns in the dirt?

546
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,857
Yeah.

547
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:38,111
See, wait wait, hold still.

548
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,112
No, I see 'em.

549
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:43,938
It's like one of them ancient civilizations.

550
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:44,538
It done-it done-

551
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,735
Holy Shit.

552
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:46,911
It done left its mark.

553
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:47,778
It's that kid isn't it?

554
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:49,510
Where did Luke go?

555
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,494
Outside.

556
00:38:58,144 --> 00:39:02,715
What did you give those two fuck-ups? Did you slip them acid?

557
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:18,853
Mary, Mary, Mary-listen. Missouri did not give us anything we did not want. Did you, no.

558
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:20,005
No.

559
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:22,341
You are all fucked up-

560
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:23,583
I love you Mary.

561
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,392
You are surely,fucked up.

562
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:28,425
Why, why Mary?

563
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:31,842
Because that's the nicest thing you've said to me in three years.

564
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:38,074
How many? You're my lamb. I'm your lamb. Mary, I'm like a little lamb that follows you to

565
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:40,604
school. I love you Mary.

566
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:42,739
Mary knows where to go-

567
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:42,999
Fuck.

568
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:44,933
For grass and shit.

569
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,138
I follow you home.

570
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:55,143
I'm going inside, into our house. Do not come back until you're normal.

571
00:39:55,143 --> 00:40:01,019
I'm normal. I'm normal! I'm just enhanced.

572
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:01,980
Stay out of the house.

573
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,251
I'll show you enhanced-

574
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,731
I feel like, we're in this giant dome.

575
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:22,886
It's like we're in a room with no walls!

576
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:32,926
Yeah, yeah no walls. But it's still a room. Our voices are here, wait. Hello?

577
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:34,270
Hello

578
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,941
Hello?

579
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,564
Echo.

580
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:38,347
Echo.

581
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:40,394
I didn't hear it that time. Did you say it? Echo.

582
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:41,085
Echo.

583
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:41,772
Same time.

584
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,317
Same time.

585
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,782
Echo!

586
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:44,657
Echo.

587
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:47,218
Hi Sara.

588
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,917
Echo!

589
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:55,618
I want whatever you're on.

590
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,896
It's acid.

591
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,639
Yeah, I want that. It's clean though. It's not laced with anything right?

592
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:08,577
No, I mean it's clean. My fingers are fluid though.

593
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:12,372
That's nice. Is it blotter or liquid?

594
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:13,750
What?

595
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,096
Is it liquid that you put in my eye, or is it blottered?

596
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:21,835
No, I wouldn't put it on your eye. I put it on my tongue.

597
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:23,822
So it's blotter.

598
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,306
Yeah.

599
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:26,458
What image is on it?

600
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:30,330
A colorful fish.

601
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:34,259
Fish, cool. So, can I see it?

602
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:41,112
Sara, you're shimmering, there's like light coming off of you everywhere.

603
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:46,468
You're fucked up, Jessie, seriously.

604
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:47,182
Yeah.

605
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:48,751
Yeah, so.

606
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:50,686
What?

607
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:53,572
No, can you give me one?

608
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:58,782
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here you go.

609
00:41:58,782 --> 00:41:59,764
Put it on my tongue?

610
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:01,907
Yeah, like a doctor, open up.

611
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,612
Will you be my guide?

612
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,889
Guide? For what?

613
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:16,981
My trip.

614
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,559
No, Luke!

615
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,788
Tell me I'm the ultimate-ultimate fighter!

616
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,740
You're the ultimate tripped up, tripper.

617
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:35,864
Luke! That's enough! You're ruinin' my trip!

618
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:41,872
I'm the ultimate-ultimate trip machine! The mind explosion!

619
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:45,258
Shit man, what ya'll gettin' into? I want some.

620
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:47,799
Yeah Luke, what's up with that?

621
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,150
I don't know, but it's awesome!

622
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,326
What is it? Meth?

623
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:56,038
It can't be meth. I'm on that right now and I'm just wired! They's into somethin' else!

624
00:42:56,038 --> 00:42:58,478
Paul, what is it?

625
00:42:58,478 --> 00:42:59,647
Acid.

626
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:01,018
Like that motorcycle movie?

627
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:01,990
Yeah.

628
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,103
Ya'll got acid? Where'd you get it?

629
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:05,378
From Missouri.

630
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:07,980
Missouri? When did you go to Missouri?

631
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:10,374
What you talkin' 'bout Paul, you never left this town.

632
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:14,451
No, Jessie. He's from Missouri.

633
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:16,573
Your new boy? From the gas station?

634
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:17,893
Where is he?

635
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:19,728
I saw him talkin' to Sara over there.

636
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:23,117
Were they talkin' talkin'?

637
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,465
I don't know if he was talkin' talkin, but he was speakin' with her.

638
00:43:26,465 --> 00:43:27,673
She's a slut.

639
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:30,380
Hey! Watch what you say about her, that's my cousin.

640
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,141
That's my cousin too! She's a whore!

641
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,648
What we waitin' for? Come on! Let's go find him.

642
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:39,364
Here's your shoe baby.

643
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:44,327
Thank you. Damnit! Quit messin' with me Mary.

644
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:45,233
Come on Doobs!

645
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:48,396
Quit, bitch.

646
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,516
Can you see it?

647
00:43:59,516 --> 00:44:01,453
No.

648
00:44:01,454 --> 00:44:02,931
It's been like 30 minutes.

649
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:11,755
Wait. I just saw something go slower. Yeah, it's bending.

650
00:44:11,755 --> 00:44:15,909
Pretty cool, huh?

651
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:19,793
Don't stop.

652
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:24,791
I'm kinda thirsty.

653
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:28,835
Okay, wait right here. I'll go get us something from the store.

654
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:30,208
Okay.

655
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:02,140
That's some good shit!

656
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:03,688
Hey kid!

657
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:11,068
There he is! Why are you hidin' Missourah?

658
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:12,476
We're friendly.

659
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,151
We just wanna get some of your acid.

660
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:20,856
I don't have anymore acid to give away. It's for my friends.

661
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:23,014
Well we're your friends.

662
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,762
I don't think I know you.

663
00:45:25,762 --> 00:45:26,873
You know me.

664
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:28,846
Yeah, from New Orleans.

665
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:30,590
Fuck no dude, from like two hours ago.

666
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,591
Chill Doobs.

667
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:39,902
We are friends with Luke and Paul. We live here. In the trailer park.

668
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:44,660
I know Luke and Paul, they're the ones taking me to the bus station. They're nice.

669
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,224
And we're nice.

670
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:49,394
It cost me money.

671
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:52,382
How much? We'll pay.

672
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,163
I'm not a drug dealer. I just need to get to the bus station.

673
00:45:55,163 --> 00:45:58,324
We'll make sure you get to the bus station.

674
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:01,358
We'll make sure you get to the bus station.

675
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,443
Luke and Paul will get you there. But in the meantime, can you take us on a little trip?

676
00:46:06,443 --> 00:46:08,217
Come on, just a few hits.

677
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,601
I don't know.

678
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:15,032
Spread the love, for a fair price. Come on, spread the love.

679
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:22,465
Okay, I guess I can sell a few at cost. Ten dollars a piece.

680
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:23,234
Fair Enough.

681
00:46:23,235 --> 00:46:25,431
It's in the back of Luke's car.

682
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:26,512
Well let's go get it.

683
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:28,346
Alright, we'll get our friends and we'll meet you there.

684
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:37,458
More friends? Paul are you okay?

685
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:44,338
I am so okay. I've been workin' on a plan to get outta here. I've been stuck here for too long.

686
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:46,009
Cool.

687
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:48,440
Yeah, it's time for me to get unstuck.

688
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,043
Unstuck?

689
00:46:50,043 --> 00:47:00,789
When I lost my farm, my head wasn't right. Now, it feels like the gears in my heads, workin'

690
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:04,422
again. It makes sense.

691
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,923
I understand. So what are you gonna do?

692
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:13,876
I dunno. Maybe become a nurse. I need to get my GED first.

693
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:14,751
Paul?

694
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:15,855
Yes?

695
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:18,389
Do you think it's okay for me to give acid to more people?

696
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:19,604
Sure.

697
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:26,361
Okay, well I need to get it out of my luggage. Hey Luke, you think you could open your trunk?

698
00:47:26,362 --> 00:47:31,068
Anything for you dude, but I can't stop movin'. Just push the button.

699
00:47:46,717 --> 00:47:48,126
Thanks Paul.

700
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:51,287
Welcome.

701
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:55,271
Hey Baby! I got some sweets for ya! Bye baby! Goodbye!

702
00:49:05,101 --> 00:49:09,980
Okay, I need ten dollars a hit. Does anybody have a scissors?

703
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,146
I got one!

704
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,038
Do you have change for a 20?

705
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,204
I can't even handle change man.

706
00:49:20,204 --> 00:49:27,757
I'll tell you what. I'll give you 40 for six. That's roughly six-something a hit?

707
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,137
Make it seven.

708
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:31,106
I'll spread it out among these guys.

709
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:31,963
Make it seven!

710
00:49:31,963 --> 00:49:33,027
I heard you!

711
00:49:33,027 --> 00:49:34,485
Fair enough. I'll make it eight.

712
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:35,610
Even fairer.

713
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,591
There you go.

714
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,356
Alright guys. Here we go.

715
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:47,195
Put it on your tongue.

716
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:50,235
Hold on ya'll. We'll all take it at the same time.

717
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:56,568
Ready? One, two, three.

718
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:02,391
Man, I need some more wine coolers.

719
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:28,593
I am out of wine coolers. Fuck. Not a good time.

720
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:24,280
You have any family around here?

721
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,105
Just some cousins.

722
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:27,840
What about your parents?

723
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,651
I don't have a dad. My mom had some problems so I moved out over a year ago.

724
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:40,481
What happened?

725
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:43,679
I don't want to talk about that.

726
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:45,027
Okay.

727
00:52:06,137 --> 00:52:07,961
Thank you Jesus.

728
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:18,369
Is there anything else you would like me to work on while I'm here, my son.

729
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:22,510
Yeah, please. Please get me out of the trailer park.

730
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,661
Luke, I'm freaking out man. What the fuck is going on?

731
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:28,322
You're on acid, dude.

732
00:52:28,322 --> 00:52:30,619
I want to make it stop.

733
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,228
You can't make it stop.

734
00:52:32,228 --> 00:52:35,719
Stop, stop.

735
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,257
You just gotta ride it out man.

736
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:45,034
I should sit down. Make it stop Luke.

737
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:53,673
I'm sure it's gonna wear off man. But for right now, you just gotta let it ride.

738
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:58,104
This couch is comfy.

739
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:08,161
This couch is comfy. That boy Jessie has brought me to Jesus!

740
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,670
Jesus?

741
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:16,650
They said I look like Jesus.

742
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:19,511
But he's not.

743
00:53:19,512 --> 00:53:22,921
Maybe like a fat, old Jesus.

744
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,525
That escaped the cross and got fat and old.

745
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:30,580
Yeah, I can see that.

746
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:34,675
I'd get a lot more respect if I was Jesus.

747
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:38,381
No, you wouldn't.

748
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:51,721
How sweet the sound.

749
00:53:51,721 --> 00:54:01,266
That saved, the wrech, like me.

750
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:26,548
I once, was lost, but now, I'm found. Was blind but now, I see.

751
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:34,909
I baptize thee, in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

752
00:55:00,335 --> 00:55:03,130
Hey, does anybody wanna play ultimate frisbee?

753
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,724
Ultimate fightin'?

754
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:07,880
Whoa, that's too intense, dude.

755
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,606
Jesus turned water into wine cooler man!

756
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:14,689
That's awesome! Did he help?

757
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:18,907
I don't know what the fuck he's doin'.

758
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:22,012
I wanna play Frisbee.

759
00:55:22,012 --> 00:55:23,463
Alright, come on, let's go.

760
00:55:23,463 --> 00:55:25,295
Come on, gorgeous.

761
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:38,122
They actin' like a bunch of fools out there. I'm expectin' the sherrif to drive up at any moment.

762
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:40,250
Why, because they're havin' a little bit of fun?

763
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:44,530
I want it! I want it!

764
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,245
Hey only one person can guard me at a time!

765
00:55:48,797 --> 00:55:51,996
You ain't plannin' on takin' any of that LSD are you Rose Marie?

766
00:55:51,996 --> 00:56:01,510
No. I wish I could, but bein' pregnant and all, I probably shouldn't. I shouldn't should I?

767
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:05,512
Damnit Rose Marie. You know, it hasn't stopped you from doin' anythin' else has it?

768
00:56:05,512 --> 00:56:08,057
Now that's just mean.

769
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:19,492
Look, I'm just trying to look after you and your unborn baby. Come on Rose Marie! Rose

770
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:25,121
Marie! Shit.

771
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:26,897
Why are you throwin' it backwards? Our goal is this way.

772
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:30,479
Doobs!

773
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:48,211
Hey Missouri.

774
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:49,719
Yes?

775
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:51,322
I heard you're holdin'.

776
00:56:51,322 --> 00:56:52,275
Holding?

777
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,754
Holding the trips.

778
00:56:53,755 --> 00:56:55,515
Oh yeah, yes, I am.

779
00:56:55,514 --> 00:56:57,652
I want two.

780
00:56:57,652 --> 00:57:00,305
Okay, I can't just give them away for free.

781
00:57:00,306 --> 00:57:04,021
If I wasn't gonna pay you for them, I would've already beat them outta ya.

782
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,096
Okay, they're ten dollars a hit.

783
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:15,934
I'll give you ten for two.

784
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,038
Deal.

785
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,523
These scissors are-

786
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:31,592
Okay those will work. Thanks.

787
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,148
There you go.

788
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,112
This better work.

789
00:57:43,112 --> 00:57:47,527
It works. Really it does. Really.

790
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:55,246
There you go.

791
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,385
Alright man, here's ten bucks.

792
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,023
Are these any good?

793
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:19,735
Wow, paper, I've never seen that paper before.

794
00:58:19,735 --> 00:58:22,442
What's the fish for?

795
00:58:22,442 --> 00:58:24,442
Liquid, fluid.

796
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:28,853
So this stuff's pretty good? Should I take a half, or should I take a whole right now?

797
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:32,983
You know what? Just take the whole thing right now.

798
00:58:37,186 --> 00:58:38,717
This stuff real?

799
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:40,610
One for me, one for the dog.

800
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:54,873
Hi.

801
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:55,938
Hi

802
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:58,153
Can I have my scissors back?

803
00:58:58,153 --> 00:58:59,184
Oh, yeah.

804
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:08,593
You are so beautiful. You wanna ride with me?

805
00:59:08,592 --> 00:59:10,580
Jessie's gotta come help me with something.

806
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:22,806
There he is! Missouri. There he is.

807
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:30,503
Mind...explosion! It's my new ultimate fighter name!

808
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:31,887
Whoa, I like it!

809
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:33,207
He even spelled it right.

810
00:59:33,206 --> 00:59:34,799
You're the one that motivated me Jessie.

811
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,912
I did, how?

812
00:59:35,911 --> 00:59:40,149
By openin' up, our eyes.

813
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,742
Wanna come help me find some lip balm?

814
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:45,949
Oh, don't forget, your bus.

815
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:49,755
The bus, yeah, I have a bus to catch. What time is it?

816
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:52,055
Hold on, the numbers won't stop movin'.

817
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:55,061
That's cool, they're dancin' look at that!

818
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:56,243
Your bus don't leave 'til eight right?

819
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:56,851
Yeah.

820
00:59:56,851 --> 01:00:04,394
It don't get dark 'round here 'til 7:30.

821
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:05,807
We're fine, the sun's still lit.

822
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:06,730
Lit?

823
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,273
Hey, let's go build a fire!

824
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,742
Hell yeah, man. Let's go burn shit!

825
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:14,157
That's the best idea I've had in awhile.

826
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:18,257
Help me find my lip balm.

827
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:22,066
Are these supposed to move?

828
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:28,172
Everything's moving. Look.

829
01:00:30,242 --> 01:00:32,302
I think we're peaking.

830
01:00:32,302 --> 01:00:34,048
Peaking?

831
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:40,409
Yeah the acid. When it peaks, the experience, the trip.

832
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:42,962
Well I don't want this to end.

833
01:00:42,963 --> 01:00:46,410
Me neither, but it does.

834
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,946
Well can't we just take more?

835
01:00:47,947 --> 01:00:54,477
Well we could take more-hey! Lip balm.

836
01:01:01,155 --> 01:01:03,511
This burns, this burns!

837
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,750
That's muscle balm not lip balm!

838
01:01:08,485 --> 01:01:12,469
Jezzabel says, you used to have a farm.

839
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,496
I did! Yeah I had acreage.

840
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:15,642
Paul, have you seen Jessie?

841
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:17,500
Hey Puddin'. Remember when we had that acreage?

842
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:20,553
You mean my parents place that we lost to the bank?

843
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:25,906
See, I know a thing or two about farmin'. You gotta rotate the crops, keep the soil fertile. Like

844
01:01:25,907 --> 01:01:31,976
one year you'll have corn, the next, soy beans. Gotta keep it in rotation. You overuse one crop,

845
01:01:31,976 --> 01:01:36,215
you ruin the soil. Kinda like with drugs!

846
01:01:37,237 --> 01:01:39,724
Has anybody seen Jessie?

847
01:01:39,724 --> 01:01:41,378
Baby, every time you smile.

848
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,933
Jessie, anybody?

849
01:01:45,934 --> 01:01:47,957
He was hangin' with Doobs I think.

850
01:01:47,956 --> 01:01:50,597
Or he could be with that skinny bitch.

851
01:01:50,597 --> 01:01:51,880
Who?

852
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,043
Sara!

853
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,409
Okay.

854
01:01:54,409 --> 01:01:59,161
Anyways, it's the same with drugs. So acid's for onetime use. Then you gotta rotate in the weed,

855
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:01,767
or alcohol on the next go around.

856
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:07,345
Found the lip balm in the bathroom. Here, let me see.

857
01:03:58,574 --> 01:04:00,184
How many days have I been here?

858
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:15,950
I think it's like weeks.

859
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,463
I have to go!

860
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:20,028
You don't have to go.

861
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,516
Don't forget about your bus.

862
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:26,736
How long have I been here?

863
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,719
Where, in here?

864
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:28,728
In the trailer park.

865
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:30,077
Since this mornin'.

866
01:04:30,077 --> 01:04:31,755
I have to go!

867
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:37,065
Yes, you do have to go. You've given every damn person in this trailer park, LSD. And you

868
01:04:37,065 --> 01:04:41,139
know what? Most these people were fucked up as it is. They don't need you here gettin' them

869
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:42,324
more fucked up.

870
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:46,488
I'm sorry. I'm tryin' to get home and I didn't wanna get my head bashed in behind the old

871
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:47,190
school.

872
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,463
Man child, you are messed up. What made you think you were gonna get bashed in the head?

873
01:04:50,463 --> 01:04:54,755
When I broke down at the Quickie-Mart, this biker dude invited me behind the old school and

874
01:04:54,755 --> 01:04:56,516
Paul said that's where they bash people's heads in.

875
01:04:56,516 --> 01:04:58,454
Yeah, that's right.

876
01:04:58,454 --> 01:04:59,889
Paul and Luke saved my life!

877
01:04:59,889 --> 01:05:01,327
You are messed up.

878
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:03,992
No, I don't know if I'll ever be able to leave.

879
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:07,903
You said you would say.

880
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:11,375
I have to go, my family's expecting me.

881
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:13,699
But you said you would stay.

882
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:23,773
Sara, you were on drugs. Jessie, you were on drugs. Hell everybody in this fuckin' trailer park is

883
01:05:23,773 --> 01:05:29,789
trippin' out of their heads except for me. There's some people wanderin' around the woods with

884
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:34,792
sheets over their heads. And I saw a group of people with their faces painted, dancin' towards

885
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:35,739
town.

886
01:05:40,485 --> 01:05:53,216
It's paint! It's paint! You have blue on your face! Look at you, come on I got some stuff we

887
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:58,471
gonna talk about. I started stackin' rocks about nine years ago. It started with just one and two.

888
01:05:58,472 --> 01:06:01,987
You're gettin' me all glittery!

889
01:06:01,987 --> 01:06:04,641
I'm gonna put it on the tip of your nose like Rudolph!

890
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:17,909
Magic stick!

891
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:23,865
Thank you for bringing me.

892
01:06:23,865 --> 01:06:25,541
What is that?

893
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:28,032
I'm Picasso!

894
01:06:38,525 --> 01:06:49,550
We're all in heaven. The universe, the universe and God and Jesus Christ love us.

895
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:52,608
I need to move you outta here.

896
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:53,721
Will you help me?

897
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:59,465
Yes, Stay here. I'm gonna find Luke, and I'm gonna get his car keys.

898
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:04,292
Don't leave me.

899
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,924
It will wear off, you don't really like me. It's the drugs.

900
01:07:06,925 --> 01:07:09,019
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.

901
01:07:09,018 --> 01:07:12,434
I like you too but, you won't like me after you come down.

902
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:16,789
No it's real, I liked you before the drugs. Do you remember when we first met?

903
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:18,789
Yeah, at the Quickie-Mart.

904
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,244
Okay, were you on drugs then?

905
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,746
No.

906
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,443
See, so the acid just sped things up, you do like me.

907
01:07:24,443 --> 01:07:26,056
I do like you.

908
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:30,744
Bounty Hunters!

909
01:07:44,802 --> 01:07:46,161
What do we do?

910
01:07:49,521 --> 01:07:52,230
Where's Luke Mcgee? He skipped his bond and we're takin' him in.

911
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:55,498
We should wait here. We need to find Luke!

912
01:07:55,498 --> 01:07:57,164
Are we gonna be on T.V.!?

913
01:07:57,164 --> 01:07:59,449
No T.V.'s maam, we're just lookin' for Luke. Where is he?

914
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,604
Oh please, please put us on T.V.!

915
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:04,739
Put us on T.V.!

916
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:11,992
T.V., T.V., T.V. T.V., T.V., T.V.!

917
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:14,091
What are these people on? Some type of Ecstacy or somethin'?

918
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,492
No, I think this is some kind of religious cult shit.

919
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,398
Kinda!

920
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:35,244
What would I do? Hey!

921
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:35,965
Hey!

922
01:08:35,965 --> 01:08:37,195
Have you all seen Luke?

923
01:08:37,195 --> 01:08:40,104
Yeah, ya'll need paint!

924
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:44,317
Yeah, we do, wait, have you seen Luke?  Where is he?

925
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:46,953
Okay. I'mma get her some paint.

926
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,448
I would do that.

927
01:08:48,448 --> 01:08:51,341
They finally found me.

928
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:52,876
Hey! What did you do?

929
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,496
It must have somethin' to do with my old meth lab.

930
01:08:55,496 --> 01:08:56,971
You had a meth lab?

931
01:08:56,971 --> 01:09:05,697
Well, no. But I never got past that Sudafed, cold medicine, shit man. I got busted five-finger

932
01:09:05,697 --> 01:09:10,893
discountin' that shit. That's stealin' to you city boy. I guess I forgot about my court date.

933
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:12,301
Well let's hide inside this trailer.

934
01:09:12,301 --> 01:09:19,047
No, I'm gonna put all that shit to rest, and I'm gonna follow my dreams. I love you man.

935
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:24,912
I'ma turn myself in, but I'ma have myself some fun first.

936
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:31,430
One, two, three.

937
01:09:33,184 --> 01:09:39,858
I am Luke Mcgee! The Mind Explosion!

938
01:09:39,858 --> 01:09:42,872
Mind Explosion!

939
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:45,666
Did you say you're Luke Mcgee?

940
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:06,520
Luke, I need your keys. I need your keys! I gotta take Jessie to the bus station.

941
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,460
They're on my belt.

942
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:12,038
Ya'll got some crazy shit goin' on over here.

943
01:10:12,038 --> 01:10:13,134
Yeah, well it's a holiday.

944
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:13,896
What holiday?

945
01:10:13,896 --> 01:10:15,158
Holy of Holies.

946
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:16,537
I ain't never heard about that.

947
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:22,199
Luke, Luke! Thanks for everything!

948
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:23,686
No, thank you Jesus.

949
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,599
It's Jessie.

950
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:27,739
Not to sound corny at all, but you saved me man.

951
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:28,622
Saved you?

952
01:10:28,622 --> 01:10:36,417
Okay, okay. Not really. But I had the time of my life man, thanks to you. We all did! I'll see you

953
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:37,978
in five to ten Jesus!

954
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:46,564
Hey, I'm startin' to come down now.

955
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:47,952
Yeah, me too.

956
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,561
I still like you.

957
01:10:50,561 --> 01:10:52,467
I like you too.

958
01:10:52,467 --> 01:10:54,375
So you'll come back?

959
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,453
I don't know. Should I come back?

960
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:57,686
Yeah, you should come back.

961
01:10:57,685 --> 01:11:00,027
My lips still burn.

962
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,963
They're probably gonna do that.

963
01:11:05,546 --> 01:11:07,063
Can I call you?

964
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:25,061
Jessie, get in the car, we gotta go.

965
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:31,889
You're leavin' us?

966
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:38,805
Jessie, I'm gonna miss you man. You're a trip. Get it?

967
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,108
Got it, got it.

968
01:11:41,108 --> 01:11:43,659
And now he needs to gets goin' ok. Ya'll say goodbye.

969
01:11:43,658 --> 01:11:47,199
Jessie, I want you to have this.

970
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,381
I will take it.

971
01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:50,481
Bye Jessie! Bye!

972
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:12,728
Hey!

973
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:13,768
Hey Mary!

974
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:15,569
Get your ass back to the trailer!

975
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:18,577
I can't stop! Help me when you get back.

976
01:12:18,577 --> 01:12:20,220
Bye Paul, thanks for everything!

977
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,429
Bye, Missourah!

978
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:24,158
Are you really jugglin' fire?

979
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:25,326
Uh-huh!

980
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:31,048
Go buy me some boiled peanuts.

981
01:12:31,048 --> 01:12:34,645
Okay, just peanuts.

982
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:37,994
The acid does wear off. Right Jessie?

983
01:12:37,994 --> 01:12:42,530
It's supposed to. Though there might be some flashbacks, I don't know.

984
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:46,318
The bus station.

985
01:12:46,318 --> 01:12:48,579
The bus station.

986
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:23,804
