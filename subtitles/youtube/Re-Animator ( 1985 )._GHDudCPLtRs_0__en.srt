00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,089
third year he was doing independent
research and switzerland with dr. Gruber

52
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,289
shortly before he died

53
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,120
the West this is Daniel Caine one of
Miskatonic medicals best young hopes for

54
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,870
the future of Medicine are you
researching death we don't see you

55
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,189
around here much anymore

56
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,120
well I was just showing our newest
student her Midwestern not so grand tour

57
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:29,459
this should interest you Carl he worked
with scuba i missed west this is our

58
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,340
eminent brain researcher and grant
machine dr. Carl he'll I know your work

59
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,649
dr. hill quite well your theory on the
location of the wheel in the brain is

60
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,500
interesting though derivative of dr.
Gruber's research in the early seventies

61
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,059
so derivative in fact that in Europe is
considered plagiarized and your support

62
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,349
of the 12-minute limit on the life of
the brainstem after death 6 to 12

63
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:04,230
minutes mr. room West Herbert West
frankly dr. hill your work on brain

64
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:12,029
death is outdated a car while I remember
I we were having a grant committee

65
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,169

90
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,600
now

91
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,569
uh look I have to go I think you mr.
West have a lot to discuss before you

92
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,528
decide anything

93
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:39,639
oh I've decided well know you'll never
even know that I'm here dad of course on

94
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,459
the first of the month Mr West miss
holding you didn't say why you left

95
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:51,308
Switzerland there was no more like alone

96
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:12,558
do we have a deal done . you make the
incision at the base of the skull

97
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:38,789
cutting away enough of the cashier to
get your fingers in and then grasping

98
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:49,079
firmly with both hands pull the skin
forward over it very much like dealing a

99
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:59,730
large orange once the skull is plainly
visible you take the bone saw

100
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,919
and you cut around the perimeter

101
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:22,379
and there you have it ladies and
gentlemen the human brain

102
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,769
once the brainstem of an individual i'm
talking about the reticular activating

103
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:35,519
system are regulation respiratory Center
once these activities cease the brain

104
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:48,840
can only survive an additional six to 12
minutes 6 to 12 minutes until brain

105
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,620
death brings about an irreversible
conclusion

106
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:09,360
we all want to retain our personalities
and some idyllic afterlife we all pray

107
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,580
for some miracle some drug potion pill

108
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:28,529
perhaps though it takes something else
perhaps it takes desire an obsessive

109
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,529
desire perhaps city

110
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,950
we will discuss the location of the will
in the brain structure at another time

111
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:49,820
mr. worst i suggest you get yourself a
10

112
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:59,269
class dismissed how can you teach such
drivel these people are here to learn

113
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,870
your closing their minds before they
even have a chance one of you for mr.

114
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,079
well you know you should have stolen
more groupies ideas that he should have

115

117
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:28,970
I would like to propose a toast national
science foundation for recognizing the

118
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:37,370
genus Carl hill and rewarding Miskatonic
medical school its largest grant ever

119
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:43,609
had your new laser drill is going to
revolutionize neurosurgery to the

120
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,609
foundation to miss katonic

121
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:54,289

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:41,190
I you please leave now easy in the head

154
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,028
I was going to show you out

155
00:22:53,788 --> 00:23:03,898
what happened it was dead when I found
you killed him he hated you think it's

156
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:13,378
suffocated not the garbage over and he
got his head stuck in a job you weren't

157
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,959
home so I put it in there I certainly
didn't think you'd want to find it like

158
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,149
that i did not want to stink the place
up

159
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:23,278
I was going to show you could call are
ready no I was busy pushing bodies

160
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,388
around you will know what I know it's a
dam cap dead details later

161
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:32,579
I knew your father you killed him I know
you didn't kill I do not like people in

162
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,579
my ruler again

163
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,538
I think you better leave now what the
hell is this

164
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,118
that is none of your business yeah i
think it is just this is none of my

165
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:54,178
business that you're sleeping with Dean
holds his daughter you know I would not

166
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,509
want to see a fellow student especially
when it's promising as yourself be

167
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:04,019
thrown out of school out of the
profession on moral grounds i think dr.

168
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,409
all just not understand do you

169
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,609
you may well be right are you sure you
want to find out

170
00:24:51,250 --> 00:25:09,609
you're that sound West West West

171
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,960
ok

172
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,720
it's really quite simple

173
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,890
all life isn't physical and chemical
process correct it stands to reason them

174
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,450
that if one could find extremely fresh
specimens and recharge that chemical

175
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,610
process bank we have to the animation
theory is not new West but my reagent is

176
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:56,399
