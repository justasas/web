1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:08,542
'What happened to this city?
Pollution and smoke on either sides.'

2
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:13,978
'Why does not anybody speak up?
Why should we tolerate it silently?'

3
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:17,246
'Put an end to this
negligent attitude.'

4
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:21,073
'Do not ignore any cigarette
or beedi that is lit.'

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,163
'Smoking is prohibited
at public places.'

6
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:26,814
''Violation incurs fine.'

7
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:29,580
'Do not smoke and let others smoke.'

8
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:32,798
'Pay heavily if you smoke.'

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,798
'Smoking causes cancer.'

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,459
'Smoking kills.'

11
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:42,974
Smoking causes cancer.
Smoking kills.

12
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,237
'Drinking alcohol
is injurious to health.'

13
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:50,928
'Drinking alcohol
is injurious to health.'

14
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,187
I joined police services in
this area station five years back.

15
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,884
Many sub-inspectors have
come and gone in this period.

16
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,931
But you are the first S.I...

17
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,923
Who has voluntarily enquired about
this case. That too on your first day.

18
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,978
It is a good work, sir.
But I am telling out of concern.

19
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:00,275
It is better not to interfere
in this case.

20
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:04,527
This is a dangerous area.
And the case you are talking about..

21
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:08,067
..it is not even registered.
That murder is just a rumour, sir.

22
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:10,783
Just came to my ear, through
the grapevine. This is true, sir.

23
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,175
It is okay. I like rumours
better than the truth.

24
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:16,195
Tell me.

25
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,769
They say it happened
eight years back.

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,186
A lot of pigeon racing
happens in this area.

27
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,182
There is talk that this murder..

28
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:26,082
..was a result of
one of those fights.

29
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,228
Pigeon racing? What is that?

30
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:31,814
Sir, you never heard about it?
It is very common in Vizag, sir.

31
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:33,376
But no one seems to know about it.

32
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,848
There are two types
of pigeon racing, sir.

33
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:37,556
One. Homing pigeon.

34
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,745
Each participant enters..

35
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,722
..about five to ten pigeons, sir.

36
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:44,788
The day before the race, participants
bring their pigeons to the club.

37
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,359
Each of the pigeons are given tags.

38
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:51,113
A secret numbered ring
is fixed to the pigeon's leg.

39
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:57,861
Then all pigeons are transported
through a lorry or train.

40
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:04,414
Depending on the race distance,
they select a town.

41
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,415
Like Nellore, Bhopal, Delhi.

42
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,504
All the cages are lined up there.

43
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,254
And all the pigeons
are released at once!

44
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,623
No matter how far
away you take it..

45
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:24,305
It flies right back
to its owner's place!

46
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,743
The pigeon that reaches
first wins the race.

47
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:37,354
Pigeon fanciers have
a lot of respect for it.

48
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,149
They are running these
competitions since long time.

49
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,938
They do not allow gambling
in these tournaments.

50
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,268
But there is a lot
of competition and rivalry.

51
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,100
There is talk that the murder
you are asking about..

52
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,079
..happened during one such issue.

53
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:47,986
Who did it?

54
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,040
There is a notorious smuggler
called Velu in this area.

55
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:50,841
You might have heard.

56
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,688
He is very famous. This entire
area is under his control, sir.

57
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,777
He exports red sanders
illegally, sir.

58
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:58,532
Even he is been a pigeon
fancier for years.

59
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,721
The killer was from his gang.

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,637
A twenty two year old boy!

61
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,728
He was not even
a gangster back then.

62
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,626
Just a boy who raised pigeons.

63
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,424
He used to look after
Velu's racing pigeons.

64
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,435
One night,
a guy from the opponent gang..

65
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:14,078
..came in the night and slit
his favourite pigeon's throat.

66
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:18,487
This boy went and stabbed
him to death in blind rage..

67
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,555
..who was feared until then.

68
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:23,247
Die! You!

69
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,059
Hey! Who are you? Stop!

70
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,655
He was just a boy who
raised pigeons until then.

71
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,294
That was eight years back.

72
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,283
He is the big-gun
in the hood these days.

73
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:37,076
We can not even lay
a finger on him, sir.

74
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:38,848
What did you say his name was?

75
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,170
Maari.

76
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,298
Velu Anna has many
areas under his control.

77
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,431
He handed one of
those areas to Maari.

78
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,936
His cut reaches him
promptly every month.

79
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:13,884
Velu Anna's main business
is smuggling red sanders.

80
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:17,190
It is the top illegal business
in Chennai and Andhra these days.

81
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:19,915
A tone of red sanders..

82
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,392
..can fetch upto a million
at the foreign market.

83
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:23,179
Velu Anna has too many
cases filed against him.

84
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,078
And even more enemies.

85
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,062
So he does not get out much.

86
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,271
He handles all deals through Maari.

87
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:32,049
There is another man
under Velu called Bird Ravi.

88
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,969
He wants to be a
part of Velu's business.

89
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,828
But Velu's support is for Maari.

90
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,048
Velu does not interfere
in matters of Maari's area.

91
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:42,223
Nothing happens here
without his consent.

92
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:46,117
Want to pay up nicely?
Or should I smash your shop up?

93
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:50,507
They are robbing us under broad daylight!
Is there no one to fight them?

94
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,692
By standing in the
sun since long time..

95
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:09,606
..they are requesting you.

96
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:13,192
I will thrash you.. - Brother!
Brother! - You are all rowdies?

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,689
Why do you request him?

98
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:18,444
Can not beat him up and get it?
- He is a ruffian. When he gets angry..

99
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,262
..everyone around him flees.

100
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:23,055
But when he is with his pigeon's..

101
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:26,836
You can see his other side.
He immediately becomes kind!

102
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:31,142
This bad guy appears to
be a good guy when he see pigeons.

103
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:35,341
For ages,
Velu was hosting these tournaments.

104
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,230
Then he left Maari in charge.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,391
Despite a lot of illegal businesses, he is
very honest when it comes to pigeons.

106
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,563
He conducts these tournaments
supervised by senior fanciers.

107
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,947
If someone cheats,
he gets very angry.

108
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,377
He stops being kind.
Hard to deal with him then!

109
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:06,274
He does not even spare
the people who are with them.

110
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:09,576
There is a guy called Robert in his
gang. His pet name is 'Sannasi.'

111
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:13,205
Whenever Maari gets angry,
he calls Sannasi from wherever he is..

112
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:16,158
..he will beat him badly
and only then his anger is lost.

113
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:19,557
Beer rates are hiked!
Why did they do it?

114
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,882
There is another loafer
roaming with Maari.

115
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:23,262
His name is Shanivaram.

116
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,613
Shanivaram? What is this name?

117
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,320
Saturday means..

118
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,783
..drinking day.

119
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:30,496
So you do not drink on other days?

120
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,346
I will drink. - So you do not
drink on other days for sure?

121
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,206
Oh dirty fellow!

122
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,968
I drink on other days for sure.

123
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,002
So why did you get
the name Shanivaram?

124
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,518
I drink on saturdays at any cost.

125
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:44,569
He is scratching his head.
I think he got confused.

126
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,620
It happens this way
but we cannot do anything.

127
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,445
He frightened everyone
to such extent.

128
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,453
There was a tournament
in that area yesterday too.

129
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:53,235
As usual Maari won the cup.

130
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,262
Sir, we cannot tolerate
the antics they do today.

131
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:40,401
"His name- Prominent!
This guy.- He is different!"

132
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:45,519
"He paves new routes.
With his steel heart he rules."

133
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,793
"His soul knows no guilt."

134
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:55,697
"He is seen all maladies.
And misery."

135
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,420
"Maari!"

136
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:03,269
"He is the good one. - He is Maari!
The dashing one. - Maari!"

137
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:08,739
"Rub him and he is gold,. Snub
him and he is a beast, this Maari!"

138
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,739
"He is the good one. - He is Maari!
The dashing one. - Maari!"

139
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:17,534
"Rub him and he is gold,
Snub him and he is a beast, this Maari!"

140
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:11,576
"Does not know the world.
Does not heed law and order."

141
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:16,677
"Does not like to change his ways."

142
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:21,592
"Does not have time for love.
Do not try threatening him."

143
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:29,519
"He is a solo contestant.
Do not you dare pick on him."

144
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,243
"Rub him and he is gold.
Snub him and he is a beast, this Maari!"

145
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:37,463
"Rub him and he is gold.
Snub him and he is a beast, this Maari!"

146
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:47,545
Today is Boss' birthday. We have
to laugh a lot. We are hired for work.

147
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,703
You both will get thrashed.
- I have got a special item here for Boss!

148
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,114
Ugh!

149
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,864
Feels light weight.

150
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,974
What is that?
- Your favourite item.

151
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,673
Hey, come out.

152
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,401
Who is he?
- Product name: Anirudh.

153
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:08,770
Ani.. - Rudh! Rudh!
- Rudh?

154
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,905
What does he do?
- He plays! - What?

155
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:13,647
He plays music and sings well.

156
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,265
Perform for us.
- I need some instruments, man.

157
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,960
Get him those instruments.

158
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:23,791
Why? Cool. Cool! - Not necessary.
Just sing and dance.

159
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:26,158
Okay, I will do it.
- Careful.

160
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:31,927
Ugh! What is his dress? Look at his
cap and glasses! Get him changed.

161
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:34,045
Come, dear.
- Hey! Hey! Bro..

162
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,360
Come.

163
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:08,569
Sir, it is better for us..

164
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,635
..to remain silent by letting his
do his work. - Greetings, sir.

165
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,901
Sir, where are we going?
- Take the vehicle to Maari's area.

166
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:17,202
We have got information that..

167
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:19,250
..betting is taking place
at the pigeon tournament today.

168
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,014
We will go there and
catch him red handed.

169
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,362
But without asking them..

170
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,788
We should not enter their area.

171
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:28,062
Are we the police or is he?

172
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,433
Start the jeep.

173
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,355
Hey, you are banned
this year, right?

174
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:48,301
What are you doing here?
Just leave.

175
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,762
I just came to watch.
Can not I watch? - Just leave.

176
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,812
Sir, he tumbled once!

177
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,197
Bro, was that okay?
- That was okay.

178
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,382
Why is it descending already?

179
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:03,274
Looks like he will not make it!

180
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,086
Who is that aunt?

181
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:14,890
You are pretending to flail your
cloth and making the bird fly away!

182
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,297
I do not even know that woman.
Must be a neighbour.

183
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,995
Do not you see that tournament
is held here? Go inside.

184
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:23,233
He is lying.
- Yes. - She is his wife.

185
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,951
You have set her up? - No, brother.
- Why would you set-up your own wife?

186
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,227
Is she your wife or a set-up?
- Did we come for her?

187
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,923
Note that down! That his
bird has lost. - No, brother.

188
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:32,892
Do not play your tricks
in Maari's tournament.

189
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:33,981
You!

190
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:38,918
How come I hear a jeep in here?

191
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,563
Where is Maari?
- Look at that!

192
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,177
Firstly, you should not have
walked in without our permission.

193
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,985
And you have the
guts to ask for Maari?

194
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:02,052
I have got information
that betting happens here.

195
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:05,311
Betting? - The jeep must
be heading towards Poorna market.

196
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,707
Must have lost its
way and ended up here.

197
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:09,052
We are just letting the pigeons
fly and looking at the skies..

198
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,181
..but you are using
big words like betting.

199
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,507
You can not organise such tournaments
without police permission.

200
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,403
Stop everything.
I need to see Maari.

201
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,884
Clear the crowd!
- What is the noise?

202
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:36,276
Did you ask for protection?
- No, Maari.

203
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,192
Then what is the officer doing here?

204
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,143
A cop's job is where
the rowdies are.

205
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,670
Rowdies?

206
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:50,783
We are flying the symbol
of peace and you call us rowdies?

207
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:54,087
Big shots participate in this,
there is nothing wrong.

208
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,951
Some enemy of mine
has told you lies about me.

209
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,912
Only a man who does
wrong will have enemies.

210
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:07,877
You should leave, sir.

211
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,918
Will not be nice if we force you out.

212
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,844
Your threats will not scare me.

213
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,399
I have got evidence.

214
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,805
Just stop everything and co-operate
to the investigation. - Evidence?

215
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,888
Evidence.. Evidence..

216
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,934
Hey! Come here, boy.

217
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:36,138
He will not hit you!
- Come.

218
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,072
Come!

219
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:43,144
You got into a mess
when you cheated last year.

220
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,302
I banned you this year because
you can not pay up the entry fees.

221
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:49,787
But you should not go to the
officer and tell him lies about me!

222
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:51,892
Tell me.

223
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,924
Does anything illegal happen?
- Hello! Leave him.

224
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,125
Talk to me.
- One minute. I am asking.

225
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,663
Tell me.
Anything illegal happening? Ask.

226
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:05,379
Leave him! - Tell! - Anything
illegal happening. I am asking.

227
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,018
Hey!
- Hey!

228
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:17,422
Let is leave, sir.

229
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,943
Did not he say nothing
illegal happens here?

230
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,600
Leave!

231
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,453
Come, sir!

232
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:37,068
Who is he? - The new sub-inspector
in the area, Maari.

233
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,533
If you do stupid things again..

234
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,733
..I will rip you apart.

235
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:01,870
Maari!

236
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,072
Maari!

237
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,223
Maari!

238
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,851
Maari!

239
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:19,999
Will not be nice if we forced you out.

240
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,100
Hey!
- Hey!

241
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:26,216
Sir, do not think
about it all the time.

242
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:27,894
What can we do?

243
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,788
Big shots are behind him.

244
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:32,288
We have to ignore it.

245
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:35,256
Not just you, all the policemen.

246
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,817
I am not like all the policemen,
Hanumanth.

247
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,709
He is known to have
committed a murder.

248
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,211
What is the use of being policemen
when we can not lock him up?

249
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:46,276
How can we act upon rumours?

250
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:49,469
It is still a rumour because
everyone let it be that way.

251
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,980
Someone told you this rumour.

252
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,046
Someone else told him.
If we follow the trail..

253
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,913
..it will not be hearsay.

254
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,182
We will find the origin.

255
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,663
We will start tomorrow.

256
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:03,103
We will start with
you and connect till Maari.

257
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,851
Mom!
- What?

258
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,103
You said you will
buy me a new bag, mom!

259
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:09,864
I am struggling to make ends meet.

260
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:12,213
You want a new bag?

261
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:15,145
Use the one you already have.
- It is torn, mom!

262
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,223
Everyone in school makes fun.

263
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,910
I will stitch it tomorrow.
Use it for now.

264
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,355
Do not irritate me.

265
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,359
I will not go to school..

266
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,420
..if you do not get me a new bag.
- Do not go, then.

267
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,919
What do I care?
Bugging me in the mornings!

268
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,909
Mom, please buy a new one. Please!
- Hey!

269
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:37,328
Loudspeaker Kavitha! - I am pissed
off already. Do not interfere.

270
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,107
Please, mom. - Your yelling woke
me up in the morning.

271
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,599
And now you are pissed?

272
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,467
You do not even have a sweet voice.

273
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,935
You are shouting like a sheep.

274
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,607
Look, mom!
He is always making fun of me.

275
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:53,786
You know he is pulling your leg.
Why are you still standing here?

276
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,694
You are getting late, go to school.

277
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,935
This has become a routine!

278
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:00,996
Why are you teasing her?

279
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,614
What were you doing, then?

280
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,751
Are you not shouting?

281
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:06,339
She asked for the bag, right?

282
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,259
Why do not you buy it?
- Where do I get the money?

283
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:12,300
If your husband does not drink for
two days, you will get the money.

284
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:14,764
You talk so much,
why can not you buy her one?

285
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:16,491
I would have bought
it if you had married me.

286
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,642
You missed your chance.

287
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,107
Look at that face!

288
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:27,607
Maari, Did someone tell you they
are moving into house number 8?

289
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,740
No. No one told me. Why?

290
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,954
Then someone has moved
in without our permission.

291
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:53,245
What are you doing here?
Stop! Stop!

292
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,486
Painting without permission.

293
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,454
Stop it, I say!
No respect for a gangster!

294
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:00,776
Move aside.

295
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,810
Oh, sorry. It is a mannequin.
- Why are you just standing there?

296
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,829
Here, hang this.
- Okay, ma'am.

297
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,067
What?

298
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:09,102
She asked me to hang this against
the wall. - Why not her face?

299
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,944
Taking orders from a woman!
We are gangsters?

300
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:15,014
What is this?
- What?

301
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,502
If you move in here and shift
your belongings without informing..

302
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,423
Should we keep quiet?
- Who are you? Why should I tell you?

303
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:24,094
Whatever happens in the area,
happens only with Maari's permission.

304
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:25,949
Got it, white bro?
- What?

305
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:28,574
Are you doing rowdyism?
- I was doing comedy till now.

306
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,173
Now I am doing rowdyism.

307
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:33,064
Here, this is rowdyism.
- Please! Please!

308
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,511
That house broker never
told us anything about this.

309
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:37,218
He said he told you.

310
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:40,973
No, sir! When did you tell us?
- Not to you, sir. - Then?

311
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,026
I told her, sir.

312
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:31,585
Slap you!
- Hey Maari, control yourself!

313
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,288
It is morning time.
- Think you can touch me?

314
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:37,692
Had you not been a woman,
I would have ruined you. - No.

315
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:39,431
Do not do anything to my daughter.

316
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,870
Poor thing, she made a mistake.
- She keeps talking..

317
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,806
..what did we do wrong?

318
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,923
We only did our duty, right?
- Yes, yes.

319
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,811
Did the broker tell
you anything? - Yes.

320
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,884
Why did not you tell us anything?
- Mother..

321
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,506
Why should we pay them up?

322
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:54,354
It seems I need to pay
them extra to open a boutique.

323
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,423
So mother and daughter are
planning to open a petty shop here?

324
00:21:58,087 --> 00:21:59,431
No. Not a petty shop.

325
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,950
Boutique.
- Mother..

326
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:04,395
Why are you explaining
all this to them?

327
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:05,950
Look.
- Hey!

328
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:09,567
Break your finger! Drop it.

329
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,270
This is my house.

330
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,812
I will do as I wish. Okay?

331
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:15,155
Look girl..

332
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:18,062
Keep your petty shop.

333
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,479
Keep him if you want.
- Yes!

334
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:22,268
But who will give you
protection for all that?

335
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:25,348
Give us our cut,
and keep whatever you want.

336
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,717
Protection? For what?

337
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,847
What will happen here?
-Anything could happen.

338
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:32,209
This glass could fall and shatter.

339
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,409
That cupboard could topple
and break. -Do not do that, sir.

340
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:40,570
Maari, something lighter, please!

341
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,096
Okay. Someone might break the TV.

342
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,107
Do not break the T.V.

343
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,283
Just give them the money.
- Take.

344
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,692
This covers the house,
who will pay for the petty shop?

345
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:52,057
Boutique!
- What do you say?

346
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,362
You will have to pay double for
English names.

347
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:58,623
I do not have cash in hand.
Give us some time. I will pay later.

348
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:00,751
One week.

349
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:02,428
I will file police complaint.

350
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,740
We are going to the police
station for the next collection.

351
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,840
No, Maari.

352
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:18,147
Her eyes are too big.

353
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:20,279
The way you were staring at her,
I was happy.

354
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,221
I thought you were in love!
- What?

355
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,125
Love? For the first time,
I felt like slapping a girl.

356
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,548
I have a principle against
hitting women. So I let it go.

357
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,982
Maari, we have seen
in so many Telugu movies.

358
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:33,036
The heroine swears in slow motion.

359
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:34,828
The hero takes it
with a smile on his face.

360
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:36,372
And they fall in love.

361
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:38,563
How can you fall in love when
a woman is yelling at your face?

362
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:40,881
I would rather catch
chikungunya than fall in love.

363
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,352
Then my route is clear.
- What?

364
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:43,724
No, I meant this is the route to go.

365
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:46,330
That girl talks too much,
keep her under control.

366
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:55,943
Hi Gajuwaka!

367
00:23:57,107 --> 00:23:58,472
Felt shock?

368
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,581
I will go in my route.

369
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:04,363
Maari Boys are hosting
11th Annual Tumbler Pigeon and..

370
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,461
..High Flyer Pigeon Competition.
We are having a prize distribution.

371
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:09,218
When we call out your name,
come and collect your prizes.

372
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,696
One important thing..

373
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:16,786
Some people fly their pigeons every year
just for the consolation prizes.

374
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,866
We have got some vessels for you.
You can collect them and go.

375
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:21,883
Medals, bro.
- Whatever, give it to them.

376
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:25,271
Maari is here. Applause!

377
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,932
Maari and the oldies
will greet each other.

378
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,267
The first prize goes
to Maari's pigeon as usual.

379
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,684
As we are hosting it,
we will be magnanimous.

380
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:43,343
But the counsellor still want..

381
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:44,893
..to give prize to Maari.

382
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:48,018
Clap! Louder! - After
all those foreign medicines..

383
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:50,269
..all we get is
the consolation prize?

384
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:53,072
This Maari does something special.

385
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:55,557
Our birds have no
value in the market.

386
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:57,721
Even people from
Delhi and Calcutta..

387
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,916
..want Maari's birds.

388
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,491
We will change everything tomorrow.

389
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,280
Next prize.

390
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:07,485
Consolation Prize.
Come on stage, Bird Ravi.

391
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:11,440
You go get it. - Hey, you are Bird
Ravi, right? You should come up.

392
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,955
I am coming.

393
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:15,642
Put it on his head.

394
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,849
Put it.

395
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:20,291
Enough, enough.

396
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:22,324
Enough.

397
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:27,301
Bird Ravi wishes to organise a
Tumbler-High Flyer tournament tomorrow.

398
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,276
Nothing happens
outside your control.

399
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:32,983
It only works if
one person does it.

400
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,661
If there is some problem..

401
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,391
Maari's name is at stake
for granting permission.

402
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,528
You are the host, you are the winner.

403
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:41,587
Why will there be any fight?
- What are you trying to say?

404
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,816
That we win because we host?

405
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:46,769
I am not saying.
Anyways, you will win.

406
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,984
At least we will have
the pride of hosting it.

407
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,125
It will boost our
pigeon's market value.

408
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,814
Earlier, a Bird Ravi's
pigeon had some value.

409
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:56,991
Now everyone comes
after only your pigeons.

410
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:58,790
We are asking this as a favour.

411
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:01,283
We have got the money
and the manpower to host it.

412
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:04,730
We will give you your
share of the entry fees.

413
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,400
You can participate,
you do not have to pay an entry fee.

414
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,028
Wow! What an offer.
- Very generous.

415
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,878
I said it like it is.

416
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,598
Hosting or paying
is not the matter here.

417
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,048
You should maintain the sanctity of
the tournament. That is important.

418
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,742
We will handle all that, Maari.
You should give us a chance once.

419
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,088
Okay. Let is give it a shot.

420
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:36,034
Thanks, Maari.
- But we are not flying our birds.

421
00:26:36,114 --> 00:26:39,675
Why, Maari?
- You said we always win it.

422
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:41,807
Why piss you off? - No, Maari.

423
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:44,509
We will be very proud if
your pigeon wins in our tournament.

424
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,923
When did I tell you about
the murder? Stop babbling.

425
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,723
You told me right here,
the other night.

426
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:04,833
Are you out of your mind?
- You are enquiring about him here?

427
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:07,056
Sir, I just blurted
some nonsense, sir.

428
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,191
Tea shop owner Satyam told me.

429
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:11,451
Officer, I do not know anything.

430
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:13,636
I might have believed you
if you had not spilt the tea.

431
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,947
Tell me the truth.

432
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:16,694
Some say it happened..

433
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:19,303
..some say it did not happen.
- Who are these people?

434
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,961
This guy called Murthy,
in the 2nd street. - Murthy?

435
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:23,906
That drunkard?

436
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:28,008
The murder happened for real
during a gang war eight years back.

437
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:31,067
That is all I know. - Everything
we heard since morning is a waste.

438
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,355
There is one person called Apparao.

439
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:34,211
Father and son pick pockets.

440
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,272
Dad is old school, does a neat job.

441
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:37,706
But the son is a rookie.

442
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,842
He was caught while stealing
chain in the market last week.

443
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:43,924
The guy got away,
but everyone saw his face.

444
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:46,209
His case is registered,
we can use that to threaten him.

445
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:49,612
Eight years back,
Maari committed a murder.

446
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,491
What do you know about it?

447
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,816
About murder?

448
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:57,143
I do not know anything.

449
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,239
Someone has given
you false information.

450
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,130
So, shall we lock your son up?

451
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,959
Sir. - Yeah, there is
a case registered against him.

452
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,397
Answer them, dad.
- What do you want to know about Maari?

453
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,759
Keep quiet!
- Why are you scared?

454
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:10,924
What can he do to us?

455
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:13,734
Ask me, sir.
- Answer bravely.

456
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:16,048
No one will know about this.
Speak up!

457
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:21,498
Back then,
Velu's gang was not in power.

458
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:25,058
There was a man called Pandu.
He was the top gun.

459
00:28:25,443 --> 00:28:28,235
Those two gangs
never got along, sir.

460
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:31,448
One day, because of some issue..

461
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,239
They say Maari went
and stabbed Pandu.

462
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,298
Then it turned into a gang war..

463
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:39,626
..and Pandu's entire
gang was wiped out.

464
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,605
Since then..

465
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:43,821
..Velu Anna's hold over
the area became stronger.

466
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,713
Do you know anyone
who witnessed the killing?

467
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,006
No sir.

468
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:51,153
I have not heard of anyone who
witnessed Maari committing the murder.

469
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,410
The case was not registered.

470
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,282
Then when Velu came to power..

471
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:57,538
..he wiped it clean.
- How is that?

472
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,248
They have killed
a man who was in power.

473
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:02,521
Maari became a gangster
only after that.

474
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,018
The whole area is scared of him.

475
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,461
But no one knows who
finished him, or how.

476
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:09,954
How would we know?

477
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,331
If something like that
happens then only we will know.

478
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:14,225
You only tell the truth.

479
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:15,345
For any rowdy..

480
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:16,859
..a murder like this..

481
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:18,509
..is a matter of pride.

482
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,105
Then why is it still a rumour?

483
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:23,547
Because it never happened, sir.

484
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,296
It is just building up, sir.
Do not believe any of it.

485
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,893
What is this? Hi dear.

486
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,136
What brings you here?

487
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:35,658
For whom you came? Came to see Maari?
Why did you bring Maari?

488
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,654
Maari, petty shop
is here with mummy.

489
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:42,144
Greetings, sir.
We did not know who you were.

490
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:44,557
We started on the wrong
foot when we moved in.

491
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:47,449
We will pay you your fees.

492
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:49,961
Just give us some time.

493
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:54,001
We were wealthy back in Delhi.
Incurred a huge loss in business.

494
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:55,167
So we are a little broke now.

495
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,384
We go broke too,
spending on booze every night.

496
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,868
We just need some time.

497
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,881
I think sir is still angry.

498
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:04,020
We came to apologize.

499
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:11,990
Your daughter does not look like it.
She seems to have come to sell sari.

500
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:14,121
Say sorry.

501
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,871
Sorry.

502
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:17,337
I did not know who you were.

503
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,686
That day I misbehaved.
Now you know who he is.

504
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,548
How did you behave?

505
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,051
Angrily.

506
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,064
You were cheeky.

507
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:29,681
Yes. Cheeky. - Insolent.

508
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:33,798
Yes. I was insolent.
- Like you were..

509
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:35,276
..some big shot.

510
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:39,509
Yes. I acted like I was a big shot.

511
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,676
Do not roll your eyes.
They might pop out and fall down.

512
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:46,012
What bro?
- Look there.

513
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:48,458
It looks freaky.

514
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,243
Sorry.

515
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:56,673
I forgive you. Go.

516
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,835
Maari forgives you. Go.

517
00:30:58,914 --> 00:31:00,401
So, can we pay..

518
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,390
..the rest later?

519
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:05,022
No need to pay up. - Have you seen?
- Thanks a lot, sir.

520
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:07,500
See, if you are
nice to the bosses..

521
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,441
..they will be helpful.

522
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,950
Instead, take me as a partner
in your shop. - Unexpected!

523
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,471
Take me as a partner in your shop.

524
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:18,016
I will..

525
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,771
..collect my remaining
money that way.

526
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:23,319
Move.

527
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,988
What is he saying? Partner?

528
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:30,955
It is all for our good.

529
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:33,355
Henceforth it is not
your shop anymore. Our shop.

530
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:34,549
Congratulations!

531
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:42,045
I checked the calendar.
Today is an auspicious day.

532
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,098
We are partners henceforth.
Shake hand.

533
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,986
It is okay?
- Little small.

534
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,615
Brother, this one?
- This..

535
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:01,717
Okay.

536
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:09,079
Want to watch adult movie?

537
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:18,548
Maari, customers are here,
please you..

538
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:20,605
Hey, guests are all here,
bring coffee.

539
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:22,235
Get coffee!

540
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,248
Go!

541
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:25,769
Go I say! What is this?

542
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,528
She is wearing a lungi!

543
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:29,872
Why are they sitting separately?

544
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:32,957
Customer? This is also same.

545
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:34,951
It is loose, take it.

546
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,063
Hey!

547
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:37,394
Let is go.

548
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:40,842
Do not feel bad.

549
00:32:54,652 --> 00:32:55,921
Modern Chilakaraju!

550
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:57,600
Who is the referee for our loft?

551
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:00,765
Who else for Maari's loft?
I will be coming.

552
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:16,547
Take care.
- Okay, Maari.

553
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:18,696
Is the boy ready?

554
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:22,558
Want me to tell him about the
missing birds? - You know about it?

555
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:24,925
Is this Maari's loft?

556
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:27,485
Maari? Say Maari Anna.

557
00:33:27,565 --> 00:33:28,754
Mister, who are you?

558
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:32,016
Your usual referee
has gone to another loft.

559
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:33,695
So they sent me here.

560
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:36,941
How can they do that? It is wrong.
Wait, I will call Bird Ravi.

561
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:39,186
Is a tournament happening here?

562
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:41,491
Yes, Ravi his organizing it.

563
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:43,678
Who? Bird Ravi?

564
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,613
Has Maari lost his clout?

565
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,035
Look at that flip! That is
my training. - Your training?

566
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,590
What is he scribbling?

567
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:02,803
It was a foul.

568
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:04,384
What? A foul?

569
00:34:04,565 --> 00:34:07,373
He is making such solid flips.
Calling it a foul?

570
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,130
He tumbled correctly.

571
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,255
Are you kidding me? Look closely.
I am warning you once.

572
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:14,427
If he does it wrong again,
you are out.

573
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,612
You will disqualify our pigeon?

574
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:17,865
Shani..

575
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:23,958
Come on. Did you see that?

576
00:34:24,038 --> 00:34:25,208
No, no, no.

577
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:27,356
His movements are erratic.

578
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:29,427
There is no form.
This one is disqualified.

579
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:32,610
This one has won contests
in the last three years.

580
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,759
He did it wrong this year.

581
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:37,610
Disqualified.
I can not cheat for you guys.

582
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,842
Who is cheating?
You or we? Be careful!

583
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:43,351
Stop. No fighting
in the tournament.

584
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:46,548
Tell him like that.
Do not know to raise pigeons!

585
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,348
They just threaten us.

586
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:52,994
Oh, is that so?
One minute. Let those pigeons out.

587
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:56,925
Which is the Tumbler,
and which is the High Flyer here?

588
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,054
Why?

589
00:34:58,134 --> 00:34:59,527
Just tell me.

590
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:02,571
Here, this is the Tumbler.

591
00:35:02,797 --> 00:35:06,233
With the way you
looked up at the sky..

592
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:11,062
..I could tell you were a fraud.
None of these are Tumblers.

593
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:14,435
I knew something was fishy
when they sent a new guy.

594
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:16,405
You will disqualify our pigeon.

595
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:20,077
And when we protest, you call Maari's
men cheats. Was that your plan?

596
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:22,177
See our product?

597
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:24,765
Thirty years of experience.
He caught you red handed.

598
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:26,791
It is not that.

599
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:28,777
You said something a while back.

600
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,672
What?

601
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:36,464
Something about raising pigeons.

602
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,385
No, I did not say anything.

603
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:43,366
I heard you. Say it again.

604
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:48,297
If the pigeon had tumbled right,
we would not have had this problem.

605
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,202
Is that what he said?
- I think so.

606
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:57,234
Am I deaf? He said something else.

607
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:59,188
Tell him.

608
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:01,824
You said something a while back.
Say that.

609
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:07,170
I said you did not know to raise pigeons
but threatened without knowing..

610
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:09,718
How can you say without knowing?

611
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:13,278
So you are saying
my pigeon cannot tumble.

612
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:17,353
How should one tumble? You tell me.

613
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:20,344
It needs to fly up and turn like that,
and this way..

614
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:22,458
I do not know how to explain it.

615
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:28,119
If you can not explain,
then demonstrate.

616
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:42,848
Maari!

617
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:46,769
Maari!

618
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:50,132
Maari!

619
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,179
Maari!

620
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:03,641
Was not that a perfect somersault?
- Yes, it was.

621
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:09,891
You do not have enough courage
to face me but trying to make plan.

622
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:13,259
I will finish him off!

623
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,597
Maari!

624
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,076
Maari!

625
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:32,574
This a petty issue,
why should you waste time on this?

626
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:35,484
What is a petty issue? Would you
be quiet if someone hits your guy?

627
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:40,101
I would not have let
anyone to hit my guy.

628
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:41,956
What Ravi did was wrong.

629
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,447
Even if there was a shortage..

630
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,388
..you should not have sent
an amateur to referee.

631
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:49,001
That was not the genuine reason.
Their plan was to disqualify our pigeon.

632
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:52,077
Just shut up. You tell us, Anna.

633
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,397
No matter what,
you should not have beat him.

634
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:58,450
Should have either talked it out or
come straight to me. - What should I talk?

635
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,689
Hey, tell Anna what you told me.

636
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:01,798
What did you say?

637
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04,663
I said they did not know to
raise pigeons but they threaten.

638
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:08,288
I was raise between pigeons.
Would I keep mum when he says that?

639
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,592
Would you have kept quiet
if someone said it to you?

640
00:38:09,672 --> 00:38:11,219
I would have slaughtered him.

641
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:14,782
If you still think it is my fault,
tell me what to do.

642
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:17,175
Anna, Maari should not
organize tournaments anymore.

643
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,502
I am here to decide it.
Both of you are at fault.

644
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:25,020
All this started because you
organized the tournament.

645
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,356
Let Maari organize it as always.

646
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:31,181
Shake hands and mind
your own jobs. Go.

647
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,284
I..
- Do as I say. Get up.

648
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,311
Hey!

649
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:37,726
Spit on it.

650
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,305
You have changed these days, Anna.

651
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,137
Anna, I have been asking
you for a while now. - What?

652
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:45,760
See your hand.

653
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:47,122
Anna.
- What?

654
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,087
I have been asking
since many days about it.

655
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:52,453
What? - I told you.
I have found a link.

656
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:54,613
The demand over red sanders
is increasing by the day.

657
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,025
If you could let me do it too..

658
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,681
You can not even organize
a tournament without hassles.

659
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,125
And you want to do this? Just mind
your job, I will take care of it.

660
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:10,838
Hello.
- Hi- Hi. Come.

661
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:15,329
I saw your designs
on your Facebook page.

662
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,693
Your designs have a personal touch.

663
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,475
We do not find that in big stores.

664
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,740
Thank you. Thank you so much.

665
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,123
Shall we shop for both the
Reception and Mehendi here itself?

666
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,782
Okay, dear. Whatever you say.

667
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,159
I am buying all my
friends identical sarees.

668
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,867
You need to design that too.

669
00:39:33,947 --> 00:39:36,127
Definitely! We will do that.

670
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:46,764
Very good fabric.
- What? Customer?

671
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,235
Yes.

672
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:51,905
I am Maari.
- Hi.

673
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:53,545
One of this shop's
business partners.

674
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,889
Hello sir, myself Satyamurthy.

675
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,574
Let it be.
- I am also..

676
00:39:57,653 --> 00:39:59,967
..a partner in my dad's business.

677
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,626
Jewellery shop.
- Very good.

678
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,728
Really? - Yeah, sir.
- Okay, okay.

679
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,362
I found the ad on Facebook.

680
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:09,025
You have come to the right place.
- Marriage is on 23rd...

681
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:11,344
Mehendi is planned on 22nd.

682
00:40:11,686 --> 00:40:14,148
Your would-be is next to you and
talking of another girl Mehendi?

683
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:15,005
I will beat you.

684
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:19,204
Sir, it is not like that.
I meant the henna function.

685
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:21,029
Say sorry to him.

686
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,374
Sorry.

687
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:26,232
He is got a separate henna function.

688
00:40:26,313 --> 00:40:29,115
Some of us can not even
afford our weddings.

689
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,577
Sri..

690
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:34,035
What is that laugh? Just like that..

691
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,123
I was talking to her!

692
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:39,266
Devi.. Discussed the rates yet?

693
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:40,857
No, I am checking designs.

694
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:42,679
Go ahead.

695
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:44,848
But I will fix the rates, okay?

696
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,639
So, here..
- Wait, wait!

697
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:53,854
I told you I will fix the rates!

698
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,786
Taking decisions without
your partner's consent?

699
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:04,748
Here is the bill.

700
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,288
This is too much, sir!

701
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:11,534
Our shop is special, madam.
You have to pay its worth.

702
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:14,366
Mr. Maari, this is unfair.

703
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:16,931
Hey!
- What?

704
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,128
You have a separate
function to apply henna.

705
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,373
This seems more unfair to you?

706
00:41:20,454 --> 00:41:23,693
Okay, sir. We will think
about it and call you.

707
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,525
Yes, we will call you.

708
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:27,966
Sit.

709
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:29,259
Will you sit if you
wife tells you to sit?

710
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,861
Sit down.

711
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,923
You have to buy from us.
These are the rates.

712
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,195
Pay fifty percent upfront and
fifty percent upon delivery. Okay?

713
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:43,400
Look, your partner is
acting like a rowdy! - Maari!

714
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,859
Whom are you calling rowdy?

715
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,797
I am a rowdy! Give money!

716
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:51,262
Sir, I will give.
- Do not give. - Give.

717
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:55,563
Saw that?
This is how you do business.

718
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,793
How do I trust you
with such a huge company?

719
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:00,068
Send my cut across
in the evening. Okay?

720
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:02,972
He is crying bitterly
just for this? Your training?

721
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,569
Who hit you, sweetie?
You look like Mr. Bean!

722
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:07,835
Hey!
- Coming.

723
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:13,007
So sorry! I did not expect
them to behave like this.

724
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,640
Sorry.

725
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,873
I have nightmares about death...

726
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,440
..for looking at death
certificates all day.

727
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:25,195
No suspicious death have
occurred in the area, sir.

728
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:29,369
If it were to happen then it will
match with a registered police case.

729
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:33,201
I checked thoroughly.
Nothing is connected to Maari.

730
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,254
This murder never happened.
Please drop this matter, sir.

731
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,971
Stop! Stop!

732
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,246
Sree baby.
Come here. Look who is here!

733
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:56,762
What are you doing?
- What?

734
00:42:56,842 --> 00:43:00,277
Partner,
I have not received my cut yet.

735
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:02,206
They cancelled the order.

736
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:04,894
Cancelled the order?
Whom he asked before doing it?

737
00:43:04,974 --> 00:43:08,333
I will finish him today.
- Hey! Stop! - Come!

738
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:09,143
Why are you stopping?

739
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:11,483
They place their order here and
bought elsewhere. How can we let it go?

740
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,704
They did not go elsewhere.
- Then?

741
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:16,025
The wedding has been called off.

742
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,367
Why?

743
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:20,307
When you threatened
them and the guy cried..

744
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:24,896
..the girl fell out of love,
it seems.

745
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,428
She called off the wedding.

746
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:29,016
Good for him, or he would
have cried all his life.

747
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:33,753
Girls do not care for love at all.

748
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:36,492
You never know why or
for what they would ditch you.

749
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,664
Maari, you are
spurting philosophies!

750
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:40,980
Do not laugh.

751
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:43,811
I borrowed a huge
sum to get the materials.

752
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:46,594
I wanted to pay off my
debt with this money. - Hey!

753
00:43:46,985 --> 00:43:49,842
Pay back your debt with
the advance money I got you.

754
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,866
I returned the money to them.

755
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,210
Why?

756
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,236
I only want to earn the right way.

757
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:05,367
Look, if you run the company
this way, you will not make any money.

758
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:10,806
I have a lot of other businesses,
you take care of your debt. Bye!

759
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:13,846
Brother..
- What?

760
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:16,077
She is crying.
- I swear on my mother that..

761
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:17,851
..I did not do anything.
- What brother?

762
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,376
Should not have let that money go.

763
00:44:20,518 --> 00:44:22,172
Who did you borrow from?

764
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:24,687
Through a friend of dad's..

765
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:26,948
I think his name is Ravi.

766
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:28,802
It is Bird Ravi.

767
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:30,634
Very bad.
So we cannot do anything. Let is go.

768
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:33,172
Your family, your problems.
Start the vehicle.

769
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:46,624
Who are you?
- We have come to buy clothes.

770
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,186
Buzz off.

771
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:49,382
Remove!

772
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:50,994
Hi!

773
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,142
Take it out.

774
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,907
Stop it, please.

775
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:57,621
Leave.

776
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,564
Sir, my parents have gone out.

777
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:03,420
It is okay. They are not needed.

778
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:05,203
Sir, what are they doing?

779
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:08,010
Vacating your store
and opening ours.

780
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,735
Sir, we are trying to pay off your
debt. Business is not doing well.

781
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:15,505
Keep quiet,
and we would only touch the shop.

782
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:17,750
Work faster, guys.

783
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:22,561
Sir, please sir.
I set it up with great difficulty.

784
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,563
My dream, sir.

785
00:45:24,777 --> 00:45:26,027
Please.

786
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:28,844
What is the noise outside?
- Make it fast!

787
00:45:28,923 --> 00:45:30,353
Stop it!

788
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:34,434
I am telling you. Stop it! Stop!

789
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:36,364
Hey!

790
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:06,695
Maari!

791
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:13,497
Maari, you know what
Velu Anna would say?

792
00:46:13,577 --> 00:46:16,695
Hey Ravi. We are following
Velu Anna's orders.

793
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,599
You touched our property,
and we touched yours.

794
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,607
Same to same!
Okay? This shop is ours.

795
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:26,148
Have not you told Bird
about our partnership?

796
00:46:26,228 --> 00:46:28,320
Bird. "Bird Ravi" right?

797
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,371
Look, we have lent her money.
This is none of your business.

798
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:33,834
You should not lend money
to people in our area.

799
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:36,573
Do we keep quiet if you come and create
ruckus without brother's permission?

800
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:38,129
We wll finish you off.
- Do not remove your t-shirt!

801
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,003
We do not know, this is your shop.

802
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,420
Do not create a scene unnecessarily.

803
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:44,763
Velu Anna has asked
us not to fight.

804
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:50,952
But if you keep showing up in our
area and Anna will know what to do.

805
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:53,895
Hey!
- Breathe out. Breathe out.

806
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:55,075
Bloody bugger.

807
00:46:55,155 --> 00:47:00,951
Maari, should we fight for some
chick? You are extorting her too.

808
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,327
That girl is from my area.

809
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:15,356
I will extort her or threaten her,
or do anything.

810
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:18,114
First you leave this
place with your men.

811
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:20,694
Maari, this is not done yet.

812
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:22,307
If it is not done
then buzz off, man.

813
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:27,100
What?

814
00:47:31,045 --> 00:47:33,511
Go, go. Do not create a scene here.
Just leave.

815
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:42,204
Maari, thanks a lot.

816
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:46,672
See what I told you about?
This is called protection.

817
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:49,983
Maari!

818
00:47:52,987 --> 00:47:56,558
Why did you pair them together?
Idiot! - Sir, they are new..

819
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,282
Nothing, Maari.
- You are a pigeon pimp now?

820
00:48:00,465 --> 00:48:02,499
Hello.

821
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:09,579
What do you want?
- After you warned them yesterday..

822
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:13,487
..they said they do not want
the money. I could not believe it.

823
00:48:13,882 --> 00:48:16,568
I came to thank you.
- Okay, go.

824
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:22,215
I mistook you to only cause
trouble to the area people.

825
00:48:22,795 --> 00:48:28,307
Now I understand that outsiders
do not mess with us, thanks to you.

826
00:48:28,387 --> 00:48:31,614
You are not as bad as I thought.

827
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:37,628
You are right.
I am much worse than you thought.

828
00:48:38,371 --> 00:48:41,654
It is.. - Stop flashing
your teeth at me. Get off my back.

829
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:45,164
Maari. Poor girl,
she is only trying to thank you.

830
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:47,598
Feeling bad for the lady now?

831
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,695
She hoodwinked that guy with his money.
She is trying to do the same to us.

832
00:48:52,775 --> 00:48:57,059
I will even work for you
till I can afford to pay you back.

833
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:01,371
Are you mad? Offering to
work for money at a goon's locale?

834
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,282
Wear your scarf properly.

835
00:49:03,362 --> 00:49:06,432
Do not know how to wear scarf
but you are a fashion designer.

836
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,278
I heard that you do not
misbehave with ladies.

837
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:12,872
Or I would not have
come to talk to you.

838
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:15,527
This will not work out.
- It will!

839
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:18,498
We are all parched.
Not just us, even the pigeons.

840
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:21,905
They must be tired of our faces.
They will be all excited if she comes.

841
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:25,323
Ugh! - She is a nice girl.
Let her work here.

842
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:27,895
At least to make up for our sins.

843
00:49:27,976 --> 00:49:31,314
I will kill you!
How have we sinned?

844
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:33,815
We are so parched, Maari!

845
00:49:46,876 --> 00:49:50,020
What is with the sudden interest?
You were fine till now.

846
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,597
Not suddenly, after coming here
and seeing you fly pigeons..

847
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:56,886
..I too got interested.

848
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:02,625
When you win, would hold the
pigeon and stand mighty, and high.

849
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,961
I really liked seeing
you like that. So..

850
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:09,830
I will come from tomorrow.
Bye.

851
00:50:16,728 --> 00:50:19,200
Hear that?
She likes seeing, it seems.

852
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,428
She meant the pigeons, you rascal.

853
00:50:31,592 --> 00:50:36,811
"I am your don, don, don.
And I am your Golden fish."

854
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:39,556
"I am your fan.
- Your looks are attractive."

855
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:42,152
"Gone! I am lost if I see you."

856
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:47,431
"Do not you pierce me with those sharp
eyes? I want all of you, and more."

857
00:50:47,632 --> 00:50:52,954
"Your rosy skin sweeps me off my
feet. I am no match for you, baby."

858
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:55,539
"Your masculinity melts me down."

859
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,980
"The bird in me has lost it is flight.
While I yearn to cross the line."

860
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,582
"This coyness holds me back."

861
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,212
"I melt away.."

862
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:14,195
"Yet, this coyness holds me back."

863
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,129
"I am a loyal husband,
giving you royal treatment."

864
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,636
"And your daily shopping
is guaranteed."

865
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:35,161
"I am your spouse and am naughty.
Giving you a lifetime service warranty."

866
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,913
"I am a loyal husband,
giving you royal treatment."

867
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,773
"And your daily shopping
is guaranteed."

868
00:51:40,853 --> 00:51:46,052
"I am your spouse and am naughty.
Giving you a lifetime service warranty."

869
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:48,218
"My dear twinkle!"

870
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:49,471
What?

871
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,094
You are my partner.
I will only pay you.

872
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:56,825
"I feel trapped, I feel the heat,
I am ready for a one on one, baby."

873
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:02,129
"I melt away..
I fade away..I shiver."

874
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:07,587
"You be with me, become my
life partner and keep me happy."

875
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:11,280
"I melt away..I fade away.."

876
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:15,480
"Naughty.."

877
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,161
"I am gone!
- Your masculinity melts me down."

878
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,523
"The bird in me
has lost it is flight."

879
00:52:23,603 --> 00:52:28,712
"While I yearn to cross the line."

880
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:36,215
"I am your don, don, don.
And I am your Golden fish."

881
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:41,586
"I am your fan.
- Your looks are attractive. - Gone!"

882
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:45,644
How is it? I stitched it.

883
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:47,601
Thanks.
- Brother.

884
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:50,313
Hey, why are you calling me as brother?
Why do not you call Maari too.

885
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:53,460
Calling him brother does not
come naturally to me.

886
00:52:54,431 --> 00:52:57,173
"And your daily shopping
is guaranteed."

887
00:52:57,253 --> 00:52:59,913
"I am your spouse and am naughty.."

888
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:02,653
"Giving you a lifetime service warranty."

889
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:05,328
"I am a loyal husband,
giving you royal treatment.."

890
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:10,945
"And your daily shopping is guaranteed.
- I am your spouse and am naughty.."

891
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:13,684
"Giving you a lifetime
service warranty."

892
00:53:19,556 --> 00:53:21,168
Two omelette here!

893
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:23,608
Maari..
- Yes..

894
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:27,149
This is love for sure.
She is in love with you.

895
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:31,605
Hey, she looks like film heroine.
How can she love me? - Brother..

896
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,304
You do not know your power.

897
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:39,956
I understand but we gave her lot
of trouble. How will she love me?

898
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:42,947
Maari, how come
you are so innocent?

899
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:47,922
Nowadays to trap a girl,
first step is to torture them.

900
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:51,585
Somehow you did the right thing.

901
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:56,161
Nowadays girls like
bad boys like you and me.

902
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,175
They do not like me at first glance.

903
00:53:58,255 --> 00:53:59,823
Are you likeable at second glance?

904
00:53:59,902 --> 00:54:02,141
How can someone like after second glance
when they do not like at first glance?

905
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:05,835
Say the girl likes me.

906
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:09,009
I should like her too, right? She is
a show off. It will not work out.

907
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:11,297
Do not say that. She is a nice girl.

908
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:13,778
She and you are made In China.

909
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:15,853
Boss, you mean made
for each other? - Hey!

910
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:17,166
Sleepy face!

911
00:54:17,246 --> 00:54:19,730
You know what I am
going through now? - Hey!

912
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:22,171
Only I get to hit him.

913
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:28,122
That is you fate. I think she is
a fine chick. She is gorgeous.

914
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:31,510
She would get rosy
if you pinch her!

915
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,550
When I see her, I just melt
and can not control myself, Maari.

916
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,439
What? - Yes,
I mean will Maari evert get..

917
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,676
..such a girl in life.
- Yes, Anna.

918
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:43,996
The whole area is
ogling at that girl.

919
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:46,621
But she has eyes only for you.

920
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:50,222
You are lucky. Give it a try!

921
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,231
Am I right for the girl?

922
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:58,574
Of course you are not..

923
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:02,204
We know that. But that powder-faced
girl does not seem to realise it!

924
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:03,761
Someone is going to
get beaten up now. - Hey!

925
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:09,652
So many girls fall for
the wrong men and suffer.

926
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:13,405
Add your name to the
list of wrong men. - Hey..

927
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:17,219
No, Maari..
A handsome groom like you.

928
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:23,068
Maari, she should be lucky
to find a handsome groom like you.

929
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:25,143
Correct, Anna.

930
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:29,876
You are sitting me down and
using this chance to pull my leg?

931
00:55:29,956 --> 00:55:31,187
No, Maari.
- Okay.

932
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:36,314
How do I explain this?

933
00:55:36,893 --> 00:55:41,258
There is no problem
as long as we are single.

934
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,445
You can just be free and happy.

935
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:46,288
When women enter the picture,
it gets messy.

936
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:49,574
I do not think this will work.

937
00:55:49,653 --> 00:55:51,237
Will not work out.

938
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:54,900
It will work, Maari.
Maari-Sri. Sri-Maari.

939
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,250
It is a good combination.
- Shut up!

940
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,668
Just meet her in person
and say I love you.

941
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:05,367
If there is a problem?
- He is the one who gets in trouble.

942
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:19,407
You too go.

943
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:21,024
Maari, there is no one except us.

944
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:25,390
It is me.
- I told you to leave. Leave!

945
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:28,045
Why did he bring
us along then? - Yes.

946
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:32,199
Hey, it is the shirt I gave you.

947
00:56:32,278 --> 00:56:35,858
Felt like wearing it?
Fits you so well.

948
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,809
You look smart, you know?

949
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:41,960
It seems you like me.

950
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:44,860
So I have decided to love you.

951
00:56:47,545 --> 00:56:51,384
First time I saw you,
I wanted to slap you.

952
00:56:51,465 --> 00:56:54,956
But then I saw the way
you were with the pigeons..

953
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:57,985
So I love you.

954
00:56:58,344 --> 00:56:59,723
What?

955
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:04,096
I did not say it right? I will
say it differently. I love you.

956
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:06,355
I love you. I love you.

957
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:09,894
I am so sorry.
I think you have misunderstood me.

958
00:57:09,974 --> 00:57:15,204
I had no such intentions with you.
I am sorry if I gave you that idea.

959
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:20,271
Oh, you do not? Okay, we will
drop the matter. I told them so!

960
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:23,422
But the fools got me excited
and confused.

961
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:25,396
Okay, let is mind our work. Bye!

962
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:31,713
Stop! Stop! - What? Do not mistake me.
It is not that I do not like you.

963
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:33,483
So you like me?

964
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:36,754
I do. - Then I love you
so let is love each other.

965
00:57:36,978 --> 00:57:40,050
No, I like you. As a person.

966
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,101
This has to be personal.
Can not do this in public!

967
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:45,690
But I do not even know
anything about you.

968
00:57:45,771 --> 00:57:48,565
What do you do?
What are you like?

969
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,494
What do I do? What am I like?

970
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:54,651
I wake up in the morning
and hang out with the pigeons.

971
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:55,916
Then I go to meet Velu Anna.

972
00:57:55,996 --> 00:57:58,512
If he gives me some work, I do it.
Then the boys come over.

973
00:57:58,592 --> 00:58:01,310
I just have fun with them.
I get drunk at nights and fall asleep.

974
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:03,456
Then I wake up in the morning,
and hang out with the pigeons.

975
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:05,862
Then I go to meet Velu Anna.
If he gives me some work, I do it.

976
00:58:05,943 --> 00:58:06,981
Then the boys come over..

977
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:09,713
..I have fun, get drunk and sleep.
That is all I do.

978
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:12,795
Not that..
How do I explain..

979
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:17,128
Even if you are a good person,
you are a rowdy.

980
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:21,949
Oh.. - I would be scared, right?
How will my parents ever accept?

981
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:23,903
We will finish them off?

982
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:25,460
What?

983
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:30,251
No! I do not know you well enough.
How can I trust you?

984
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:35,014
You do not need to trust me. Let this go.
Do not let it confuse you. Bye!

985
00:58:38,672 --> 00:58:45,360
"The Prince who rules the world.
That is me."

986
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:52,864
"You are the Princess
who stole my heart."

987
00:58:52,945 --> 00:58:54,849
Maari!

988
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,006
Something wrong.

989
00:58:57,197 --> 00:58:59,567
What happened?
- Not there, Maari.

990
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:02,528
Why does not that girl like you?
- Do not know.

991
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:05,432
Did you tell her properly?

992
00:59:05,797 --> 00:59:10,803
I told her I love you in every possible
way! - Do not say like that, Maari.

993
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:16,349
I.. - I.. - Love..
- Love.. - You.. - You..

994
00:59:16,664 --> 00:59:20,621
Say like this. - Why do
you split it in three like that?

995
00:59:20,701 --> 00:59:23,481
Because it is three words!

996
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:27,180
What? Is not'I love you'
a single word.

997
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:32,749
No. - No? - No. - So why did not
you tell me this before?

998
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:34,692
Shanivaram!

999
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,846
Your girl? - Why have
you brought this girl here?

1000
00:59:38,927 --> 00:59:41,378
She wanted to talk to you,
brother.

1001
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:47,280
You have come to develop
our friendship? Come.

1002
00:59:47,532 --> 00:59:52,288
Sit. Sit. - Go. You too go.
Come in the morning. You sit.

1003
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:56,287
Want a drink?
- No. - She must be drunk already.

1004
00:59:56,367 --> 01:00:01,144
You only drink in star hotels.
- I need to talk to you. - Talk.

1005
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:05,356
I did not tell you
that I do not like you.

1006
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,863
I just wanted to
know more about you.

1007
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:12,766
But you had left by then. - What
do you want to know? - Who are you?

1008
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:14,876
How did you turn out this way?

1009
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,186
Turn out what way?

1010
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:24,358
Turn out what way?
- No, everyone fears you.

1011
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:26,452
Including me.

1012
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,530
Do I look like a rapist?

1013
01:00:31,081 --> 01:00:32,893
Only gutless men rape.

1014
01:00:33,503 --> 01:00:35,083
I am a real man.

1015
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,057
Real men do not rape.
- No, no..

1016
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:40,167
I know about you.

1017
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:41,978
But everyone is so scared of you.

1018
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:45,540
There must be some reason.
Violence.

1019
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,000
Murders..

1020
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:51,253
Murder?

1021
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:56,806
Nothing of that sort.

1022
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:09,221
Murder..

1023
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,942
Can not really call it a murder.

1024
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:16,981
Murder..

1025
01:01:17,836 --> 01:01:21,434
Something like murder.
Pretty much murder.

1026
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:24,905
There was this guy
called Pandu in my town.

1027
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:28,643
Real big shot. Not any one
could have laid a finger on him.

1028
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,911
One day I just went
and casually stabbed him.

1029
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,038
Who are you? Anna!

1030
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:38,275
But he did not die.
So it does not count as murder.

1031
01:01:38,356 --> 01:01:43,940
Someone else finished him off
two days later. But I got all the credit.

1032
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,413
It will not work out.
Go home and think all night.

1033
01:01:52,492 --> 01:01:54,717
If it is okay then okay.
Or else leave it.

1034
01:01:54,797 --> 01:02:01,402
Stop bothering me.
Okay? Get out. Get out.

1035
01:02:01,672 --> 01:02:04,925
She came in style..

1036
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:15,317
Why is the police here
without permission? - Do not yell.

1037
01:02:15,476 --> 01:02:17,045
He is come with a warrant.

1038
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:20,467
Maari's asleep. Come back later.
- Do not yell!

1039
01:02:21,021 --> 01:02:23,972
Do not make a sound or
I will kill you. - Heard that?

1040
01:02:24,052 --> 01:02:25,947
We have got a warrant against you.

1041
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,871
Officer asked me to bring you in.
- Who is the officer?

1042
01:02:42,132 --> 01:02:46,217
I said to wake me up early morning,
I am getting bad dreams.

1043
01:02:46,297 --> 01:02:49,731
Get up. We have come to arrest you.
- Arrest? Why?

1044
01:02:58,293 --> 01:02:59,698
Murder?

1045
01:03:01,188 --> 01:03:05,186
Murder? Something like murder.

1046
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:07,021
There was this guy called
Pandu in our town.

1047
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:10,481
Real big shot. Not anyone
could have laid a finger on him.

1048
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:13,043
One day I just went
and casually stabbed him.

1049
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:23,300
Give money!
This is how you run a business.

1050
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,157
I can not take this anymore.

1051
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,563
I am going to the police.
- Listen to me, madam.

1052
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:32,530
It is an unnecessary trouble.
- I do not care.

1053
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,134
I want to meet the sub-inspector.

1054
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:36,538
Nothing, sir.
It is just a petty case. - Sir..

1055
01:03:36,617 --> 01:03:37,978
Sir, I want to file a complaint
against Maari.

1056
01:03:38,057 --> 01:03:40,297
Nuisance case. File the complaint.

1057
01:03:40,378 --> 01:03:43,852
I am ready to testify anywhere.
- I appreciate your bravery.

1058
01:03:43,931 --> 01:03:47,232
But if I charge him with this small
case then he will come out easily.

1059
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:49,780
After that he will cause
more trouble for you and me.

1060
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:52,262
We need to catch
him in a bigger case.

1061
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:54,500
I will be glad to
help however I can.

1062
01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:56,682
After a lot of searching..

1063
01:03:56,762 --> 01:03:59,864
I have found the
file of a closed case.

1064
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,229
The murder attempt
of a man named Pandu.

1065
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,784
The suspicion's
age and description..

1066
01:04:04,934 --> 01:04:07,966
..fits with Maari.
But that is not enough.

1067
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:11,021
We need stronger evidence
connecting Maari to the case.

1068
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,916
What can I do for this?

1069
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:18,079
What would you do?
- I will help you.

1070
01:04:22,244 --> 01:04:24,721
Calling him brother does not
come naturally to me.

1071
01:04:31,072 --> 01:04:32,461
What happened, Maari?

1072
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:40,756
Be careful!
- Hey!

1073
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:44,215
Just hangover from last
night's booze. Give that.

1074
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:49,256
You are disturbing
me early morning.

1075
01:04:50,746 --> 01:04:53,304
Good job, man. Good job.

1076
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,460
I have done lot of hooliganism.

1077
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:07,674
I broke hands and legs, I did
many things. Nothing happened then.

1078
01:05:07,755 --> 01:05:09,664
For the first time ever..

1079
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,010
I fell in love.
And they are going to lock me up.

1080
01:05:13,235 --> 01:05:15,896
That is the fate.
Fall in love, Maari..

1081
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,278
Fall in love, Maari!
Fall in love, Maari!

1082
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,533
Screwed us, right?

1083
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:22,994
What are you looking at?
Come, take me away.

1084
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,839
He suggested it but
the girl has accepted it.

1085
01:05:27,012 --> 01:05:29,765
Everyone seems to have developed,
just not us.

1086
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,212
Wait.

1087
01:05:32,786 --> 01:05:35,416
Is it okay? - Little bit
to the right. - Which side?

1088
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,421
Left side. - Okay?
- Perfect.

1089
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:44,458
Why are they bursting crackers?
Is it a festival day?

1090
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:48,335
Not a festival, Maari.
The news of your arrest has spread.

1091
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,077
Rascals!

1092
01:05:50,157 --> 01:05:52,931
They do not even burst
crackers for holidays.

1093
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,009
But look at them
celebrating my arrest!

1094
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,582
They have torn it already?

1095
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,191
You guys do not stay here.

1096
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:02,736
Go away.
They will keep prodding you.

1097
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:05,997
If a girl comes and says
she loves you, just chase her away.

1098
01:06:06,077 --> 01:06:08,226
We do not have anyone
but you, Maari.

1099
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:11,358
No one in the area will
respect us now. Tell him.

1100
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,434
Who do we have but you?

1101
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:18,182
Did not work out. Do not overact.
You uncle lives in Kakinada, right?

1102
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:19,842
Go.

1103
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:33,310
You have won. You used a woman,
but you still won.

1104
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:34,780
When you waltzed into
my area without permission..

1105
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:35,893
..I should have bumped you off.

1106
01:06:35,974 --> 01:06:37,514
Sparing you was a mistake.

1107
01:06:37,724 --> 01:06:41,566
Where is that girl?
She must be feasting her eyes.

1108
01:06:44,623 --> 01:06:48,039
What an actor you are!

1109
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,094
With all that talking and smiling,
you have finished me, right?

1110
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:53,714
See her.
- She is ripped me apart, right?

1111
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,909
She trapped you very well.

1112
01:06:57,635 --> 01:06:58,663
Get into the vehicle.

1113
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:01,161
Will not be nice if we force you in.

1114
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,326
Oh, my dialogue from the other day?

1115
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:06,051
Good! It was a good counter,
let is go.

1116
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:11,777
Bye.

1117
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:18,365
No AC?

1118
01:07:31,023 --> 01:07:33,115
Maari!

1119
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:36,981
Maari!

1120
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:52,257
Here comes Maari! Let is go.

1121
01:07:56,818 --> 01:08:00,052
How are you? How are you, Anna?
- I am fine, Maari.

1122
01:08:01,063 --> 01:08:03,902
Thought you would have lost
weight but you are all fat.

1123
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:05,833
How are you?
- What Maari?

1124
01:08:06,717 --> 01:08:08,715
You have lost so much weight.

1125
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:10,911
When have I ever been fat?
- Beat like that, brother.

1126
01:08:11,108 --> 01:08:13,083
One tea for Anna!
- Okay, brother.

1127
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,675
So, what is going on, old man?

1128
01:08:15,146 --> 01:08:17,260
With me gone, everyone in
the area must have been at peace?

1129
01:08:18,858 --> 01:08:21,081
No, Maari.
The situation in the area..

1130
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,291
..has become very bad.

1131
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:26,503
What happened? - They have arrested
Velu Anna and kept him under remand.

1132
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,833
What? - You said it was not safe for
us to be here when you are in jail.

1133
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:32,507
We went out of town
for a little while.

1134
01:08:32,587 --> 01:08:34,671
When we returned,
the area was unrecognisable.

1135
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:37,300
That cop did not just
target us for no reason.

1136
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:40,163
He had his own agenda.
- What?

1137
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,689
They have arrested Maari
and you are just telling me!

1138
01:08:42,829 --> 01:08:44,532
When he was being arrested..

1139
01:08:44,905 --> 01:08:47,590
Start the vehicle.
I want him released today!

1140
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,470
Sir! Sir!

1141
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,605
Sir! Sir..

1142
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,446
Sir.. Please, sir.

1143
01:08:54,884 --> 01:08:57,454
We have got information that
you are smuggling red sanders.

1144
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,666
The Revenue Department
is here with a search warrant.

1145
01:09:00,746 --> 01:09:02,578
Do you know whose place this is?

1146
01:09:02,658 --> 01:09:04,209
Fool, there are cameras.

1147
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:07,485
How did the media get
here even before searching?

1148
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,208
I do not know, sir.

1149
01:09:10,962 --> 01:09:13,025
Someone must have
leaked information.

1150
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:14,886
Sir, start the search.

1151
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:22,846
When Velu Anna got
arrested and put in jail..

1152
01:09:23,106 --> 01:09:25,150
..all the MLA's
supported him backed out.

1153
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:27,435
There was no one to bail him out.

1154
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:30,838
Arjun has a solid reputation..

1155
01:09:30,996 --> 01:09:33,123
..at the Department for
busting rowdyism in the area.

1156
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:34,849
Everyone in the
area was very happy!

1157
01:09:35,014 --> 01:09:37,069
They celebrated that fellow Arjun.

1158
01:09:37,944 --> 01:09:39,872
He came to our area one night.

1159
01:09:40,527 --> 01:09:41,814
He entered with a plan.

1160
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:45,534
You might have heard about the red
sanders smuggling arrest from last week.

1161
01:09:45,826 --> 01:09:47,908
The Forest Department
has decided to..

1162
01:09:48,073 --> 01:09:50,536
..export the wood legally.

1163
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:52,497
This job requires immediate labour.

1164
01:09:52,757 --> 01:09:55,873
Thought this would be a good opportunity
for the unemployed in the area.

1165
01:09:56,153 --> 01:09:58,257
If you are interested,
you may sign up for the job.

1166
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:00,914
Officer Arjun has come
up with this. We can trust him.

1167
01:10:00,994 --> 01:10:04,947
Let is sign up. - You have received
an invitation to get a job!

1168
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:07,062
Go sign up.

1169
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:09,895
You too come, we will
go and sign up. - Sir, sir..

1170
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:12,187
This will not suit me at all.

1171
01:10:25,652 --> 01:10:28,675
Both red sanders and ordinary
wooden logs are stacked here.

1172
01:10:28,952 --> 01:10:31,920
One load of each needs to be..

1173
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,369
..loaded in the
lorries That is the job.

1174
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:48,097
The people asked no questions
and continued to work this way.

1175
01:10:48,738 --> 01:10:51,554
This went on for two, three days.

1176
01:10:52,237 --> 01:10:53,862
One day, Arjun..

1177
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:55,512
..did not turn up at the yard.

1178
01:10:57,048 --> 01:10:58,735
There was a raid that night.

1179
01:11:05,945 --> 01:11:07,945
Seize the goods and make a report.

1180
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:10,599
Stop the labourers.
No one shall escape. - Yes, sir.

1181
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,942
Sir, this is taking place with
government's permission. - Yes.

1182
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:15,471
A government job taking place
all hushed up in a closed mill?

1183
01:11:15,551 --> 01:11:16,989
Sir, something is wrong.

1184
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:19,864
You may call Officer Arjun.
He is the one who got us these jobs.

1185
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:22,036
We went straight to him
after finding this place.

1186
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:23,552
He asked us to make the arrests.

1187
01:11:23,632 --> 01:11:25,742
Just get in the jeep!
- Sir! Sir!

1188
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:29,099
Sir! Sir! Leave!

1189
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:31,453
Just get in the jeep!

1190
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,246
Why is he running like this?

1191
01:11:34,327 --> 01:11:36,724
The people who had signed
up for transporting the wood..

1192
01:11:36,804 --> 01:11:39,416
They have been arrested and
taken in with charges of smuggling.

1193
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,021
What are you saying?

1194
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:43,720
Officer Arjun had taken them for
the job. Did you tell him about it?

1195
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,963
I went to the station. They
said he has taken two days off.

1196
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:50,989
The next day,
strange things began to happen.

1197
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:54,344
Listen up, everybody!

1198
01:11:54,497 --> 01:11:57,214
All the shops in the market place
are under Ravi Anna's control now.

1199
01:11:57,418 --> 01:12:00,493
You had better pay up on time..

1200
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:02,346
..if you want to your
shops to remain. - Hey!

1201
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:05,687
Even Maari is gone now. Who are
you to collect from us? - Exactly!

1202
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,394
Want to see what would happen
if Officer Arjun finds out?

1203
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,536
You were right! I had to see what
would happen if Arjun finds out.

1204
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:31,091
Anyone else has something to say?

1205
01:12:32,005 --> 01:12:36,282
I shall never hear
Maari's name again.

1206
01:12:36,703 --> 01:12:39,057
Whatever I say will be the law.

1207
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:41,006
That is when we found
out the real matter.

1208
01:12:41,087 --> 01:12:43,773
This cop and "Bird" Ravi
were in it together the whole time!

1209
01:12:43,853 --> 01:12:46,488
Sir, we sent our men to
work only because of your word.

1210
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:48,271
Now they are saying
something about smuggling!

1211
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,057
Yes. I did take them
for a smuggling job.

1212
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:53,472
Ravi and I did all this together.

1213
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:56,875
If I had told you smuggling
then would not have come to work.

1214
01:12:56,954 --> 01:12:59,390
We were just trying it for the first time.
There was a small goof up.

1215
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,052
And there was a raid, too!

1216
01:13:01,132 --> 01:13:04,969
Sir, testify that they did not know what
the job was. And get them released, sir.

1217
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,737
Are you stupid?
Then I wll get caught.

1218
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,514
No way. Just leave.
- Sir. - Sir..

1219
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,907
Sir, I helped you because
I thought you were a good guy.

1220
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,872
How could you listen to
them and do such terrible things?

1221
01:13:14,952 --> 01:13:16,307
Listen to them?

1222
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:20,598
This was all my idea. Do you know
why we got Maari arrested?

1223
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,695
To take their places.

1224
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:27,617
This is why I re-opened
Maari's old case.

1225
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:31,668
You stopped being of
use after Maari's arrest.

1226
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:33,953
Do not ask unnecessary questions.
Mind your business.

1227
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:35,914
No. I will not let this go.

1228
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:38,282
What will you do, woman?

1229
01:13:38,363 --> 01:13:40,199
Sir, this is wrong.

1230
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:42,782
Hanumanth, chase them away.
- Sir..

1231
01:13:43,155 --> 01:13:45,345
What are you staring at?
- Poor people.

1232
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:49,029
Let is get them out somehow!
- Listen, just do as I say.

1233
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:50,506
Everybody, leave.

1234
01:13:51,347 --> 01:13:56,079
Their plan was to arrest you and
Velu Anna and smuggle red sanders.

1235
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,019
Leave! Move!

1236
01:14:10,509 --> 01:14:12,587
"Bird" Ravi's controls..

1237
01:14:12,667 --> 01:14:14,626
..Pigeon race and tournaments.

1238
01:14:14,815 --> 01:14:16,518
There is no ethics.

1239
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:19,997
It is terrible. They just
do everything to their convenience.

1240
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:23,488
Most of the pro fanciers
have stopped racing.

1241
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:34,682
Cheers!

1242
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:38,820
I got word from Velu
Anna after your release.

1243
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:42,782
He said to leave the area.
That it will be better to vacate.

1244
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:48,445
Let is leave.
- Why did you say like that, Maari?

1245
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:49,877
What else should I say?

1246
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:53,858
Velu Anna has said so himself.
Who do we stay back for?

1247
01:14:54,609 --> 01:14:56,045
Bring the pigeons and everything.

1248
01:14:56,126 --> 01:14:57,547
Let is leave.

1249
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,788
Sannasi, you heard him.

1250
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:03,015
Pack our stuff and
bring the vehicle.

1251
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:04,664
We will not visit that area again.

1252
01:15:07,162 --> 01:15:09,411
Why are they loading things?
- I do not know!

1253
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:12,685
You useless,
bring it carefully. - What?

1254
01:15:12,837 --> 01:15:14,650
Where are you going?

1255
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:16,797
Has Maari been released?

1256
01:15:17,301 --> 01:15:19,463
Is he here, too?
- Tell me! - Are you blind?

1257
01:15:19,543 --> 01:15:20,600
We are just leaving.

1258
01:15:22,202 --> 01:15:24,735
We wll never come by here.
You can be happy. - Hold it.

1259
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:28,116
It is so hard to
leave our birthplace!

1260
01:15:28,197 --> 01:15:30,291
Look, it is hard for us, too.

1261
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:33,216
You deserve it!
You played the fiddle to that cop.

1262
01:15:33,465 --> 01:15:37,307
We wll do our jobs elsewhere.
People will spit on you later.

1263
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:44,692
Look who else is here

1264
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,668
They are leaving with
their belongings. - Sannasi!

1265
01:15:47,903 --> 01:15:50,369
Is notyour Anna Maari here?
- How will he come?

1266
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:52,023
How could he ever
face anyone in the area?

1267
01:15:52,104 --> 01:15:54,405
Look, do not show off
after doing stupid things.

1268
01:15:54,796 --> 01:15:57,776
You are not fit to compete
with Anna. Leave! Leave!

1269
01:15:57,904 --> 01:15:59,813
What qualification do we need?
What qualification do we need?

1270
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:01,407
Do not do it I say!

1271
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:04,298
Go ahead and do it. He can
take a beating. - Yes, he can.

1272
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,811
Maari hits you everyday.

1273
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:08,694
Let us hit you today.

1274
01:16:08,842 --> 01:16:10,037
Hit him!

1275
01:16:10,117 --> 01:16:11,914
I will hit you
and you will take it.

1276
01:16:12,225 --> 01:16:13,606
He was leaving anyway.

1277
01:16:13,685 --> 01:16:17,985
Old man! - What is this?
- Hey, let him go!

1278
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,220
Hey! You!

1279
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:59,900
Maari!

1280
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:03,911
Come.
- You will go to him?

1281
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:54,816
Maari!

1282
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,140
Do not do it, Maari! Do not!

1283
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:12,057
Hey, dummy!
Looks like your face is poached.

1284
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:14,295
Cheekiness is bad.

1285
01:18:55,686 --> 01:18:57,923
"Maari is back!"

1286
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,519
"Maari is a fireball."

1287
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:03,319
"Bigger and better."

1288
01:19:03,787 --> 01:19:07,072
"Take to your heels."

1289
01:19:15,563 --> 01:19:21,440
"Your face will get mangled, eyes
removed, shape beyond recognition."

1290
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,938
"Maari is back! Maari is a fireball!
He will cross all his limits."

1291
01:19:30,912 --> 01:19:32,320
"That is Maari."

1292
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:37,804
"That is Maari."

1293
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:42,835
Go. Go and tell the cop.

1294
01:19:44,042 --> 01:19:45,895
I will be here.

1295
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,881
He may have the area
under his control.

1296
01:19:48,204 --> 01:19:50,820
But Maari is always out of control.

1297
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,456
Only I get to beat him up.

1298
01:19:57,242 --> 01:20:00,079
Think you get to
show off in my area?

1299
01:20:02,117 --> 01:20:03,125
I wll finish you off!

1300
01:20:32,225 --> 01:20:34,073
Stop! What are you doing here?

1301
01:20:34,154 --> 01:20:35,572
Maari does not want
to see your faces.

1302
01:20:35,652 --> 01:20:39,298
Go away. - Get out of my way!
We want to talk to our man Maari.

1303
01:20:39,378 --> 01:20:41,358
Your man Maari? - Do not
you understand when we tell?

1304
01:20:41,506 --> 01:20:43,675
Maari, things got really
rough in your absence.

1305
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,731
That cop tricked us and..

1306
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:47,899
..got us in trouble.
- Not just that..

1307
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:49,409
..he is hiked the bribe threefold.

1308
01:20:49,489 --> 01:20:51,997
None of us can live!
- Drop dead, then. - Yes, Maari.

1309
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:53,858
We were really scared and helpless.

1310
01:20:53,938 --> 01:20:56,365
We wll be brave
now that you are here.

1311
01:20:58,635 --> 01:20:59,884
Hey, you..

1312
01:20:59,963 --> 01:21:02,345
You are the ones who
burst crackers and..

1313
01:21:02,426 --> 01:21:03,875
..celebrated my arrest!

1314
01:21:03,954 --> 01:21:06,163
This wash-basin face was
the one who fired a flower-pot.

1315
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:10,280
You people chose to
be allied to that cop.

1316
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,978
Suffer, now.

1317
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:14,633
Go away!

1318
01:21:14,712 --> 01:21:18,881
Maari! - Leave! Leave!
Maari Anna told you. - Leave!

1319
01:21:32,502 --> 01:21:33,525
Are you stupid?

1320
01:21:33,762 --> 01:21:35,947
He would have left on his own.

1321
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:38,907
Now you picked a fight
with him and made him stay back.

1322
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:41,826
What could he do here, anyway?

1323
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:44,965
We shall corner him..

1324
01:21:45,824 --> 01:21:47,393
..at the right time and place.

1325
01:21:49,398 --> 01:21:51,791
Check if all the pigeons
are in the right condition.

1326
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,373
I wll come and check on
the young birds in the morning.

1327
01:21:54,989 --> 01:21:57,469
We wll start the training
tomorrow morning.

1328
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:02,149
Okay, Maari. - Okay?
- How dare you come back again?

1329
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:03,926
I came to say sorry.

1330
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:05,588
I am sorry.

1331
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:09,568
I know you must
be very angry with me.

1332
01:22:09,911 --> 01:22:13,243
But I did have my reasons.

1333
01:22:13,323 --> 01:22:15,222
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

1334
01:22:15,475 --> 01:22:18,339
I did not realise I was helping..

1335
01:22:18,835 --> 01:22:20,326
..the bad guy.

1336
01:22:20,859 --> 01:22:23,252
Anyhow, it is wrong to betray..

1337
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:26,374
..someone's trust in any situation.

1338
01:22:26,837 --> 01:22:28,722
So, I am really sorry.

1339
01:22:31,104 --> 01:22:33,300
I have come all the way to apologise!

1340
01:22:33,591 --> 01:22:36,257
Will not you at least respond to me?

1341
01:22:39,805 --> 01:22:41,207
I forgive you. Leave.

1342
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:50,595
Go, go.

1343
01:22:51,525 --> 01:22:53,886
Maari asked you to leave! Leave.

1344
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,559
Do you know why Maari
committed that murder?

1345
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,288
Because they killed
his loved pigeon.

1346
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:05,458
Tell me honestly.

1347
01:23:05,693 --> 01:23:08,351
If you had been in his place, would not you
be furious? Would not you do anything?

1348
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:11,747
Why do you trouble the area people?

1349
01:23:11,828 --> 01:23:13,591
Why can not you show
the affection on people..

1350
01:23:13,671 --> 01:23:16,279
..that you bestow upon pigeons?
- Why should we?

1351
01:23:16,412 --> 01:23:17,967
To these people?

1352
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:19,644
Did they do that for Maari?

1353
01:23:20,837 --> 01:23:22,805
Who helped him when he was a kid?

1354
01:23:23,536 --> 01:23:26,006
When he was alone and hungry?
Who helped him then?

1355
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,859
Not one person came.

1356
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:30,118
He only had one thing then.

1357
01:23:30,198 --> 01:23:31,457
His pigeons.

1358
01:23:31,537 --> 01:23:33,152
It was the pigeons that fed him.

1359
01:23:33,231 --> 01:23:35,904
Maari always says..

1360
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:37,878
..you can trust a pigeon..

1361
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:41,186
..but not a human.
Now you have proved him right.

1362
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,195
What I did seemed right that day.

1363
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:45,711
Do not you talk about
right and wrong!

1364
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:47,559
Have you ever struggled in life?

1365
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:49,000
Have you ever struggled
for a daily meal?

1366
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:50,445
If you just waltz
in here and apologise..

1367
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,161
..think he wll grin and accept?

1368
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,487
Look, he does not ever want to set
eyes on you after what you have done.

1369
01:23:55,645 --> 01:23:57,517
If you keep coming back here..

1370
01:23:57,853 --> 01:23:59,262
..it will get rough.

1371
01:23:59,877 --> 01:24:01,851
Stop talking to her. Let is leave.

1372
01:24:20,605 --> 01:24:22,452
What is your problem?

1373
01:24:24,235 --> 01:24:26,305
Tell me, or buzz off!

1374
01:24:26,502 --> 01:24:31,104
A few days after you went to
the jail, my school fees was due.

1375
01:24:31,184 --> 01:24:35,047
But it was not paid at all.
After that my school staff said..

1376
01:24:35,127 --> 01:24:38,431
..you were paying my fees.

1377
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,311
I was not paying.

1378
01:24:42,391 --> 01:24:45,523
I know you are paying
without anybody's knowledge.

1379
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:48,126
It is okay, I will not tell anybody.

1380
01:24:48,206 --> 01:24:50,595
Did not I say that I have not paid?

1381
01:24:50,867 --> 01:24:53,559
What do I care if
you go to school? Leave.

1382
01:24:55,076 --> 01:24:59,024
Did that cop trick you and
jail you?

1383
01:25:03,962 --> 01:25:06,309
Did they hit you in the jail?

1384
01:25:08,283 --> 01:25:10,131
Did you suffer?

1385
01:25:12,519 --> 01:25:13,979
Poor thing.

1386
01:25:15,264 --> 01:25:16,788
It was not that bad. Go, now!

1387
01:25:16,953 --> 01:25:19,822
I was not talking about you.
I meant the cop.

1388
01:25:19,902 --> 01:25:22,524
You wll get him, one fine day!

1389
01:25:32,076 --> 01:25:33,965
Loudmouth, go to sleep.

1390
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,427
Rogue!

1391
01:25:45,514 --> 01:25:47,243
We can enter our birds
to the race next week.

1392
01:25:47,323 --> 01:25:48,780
All the pigeons are ready.

1393
01:25:48,963 --> 01:25:51,327
Our next target is Arjun.

1394
01:25:51,676 --> 01:25:54,579
Do not know why, but my hands
feel all jittery since morning.

1395
01:25:54,659 --> 01:25:55,764
What?
- No!

1396
01:25:55,844 --> 01:25:58,604
Need to do something about
this Arjun and "Bird Ravi".

1397
01:25:58,684 --> 01:26:02,030
He is a cop.
You can not do him on urgent basis.

1398
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,046
Must keep calm.

1399
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:08,725
I am idle nowadays.
Feeling a little lazy.

1400
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:15,947
I am so bored. I want to some job.
- Job?

1401
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:19,119
Oh Jesus! Save this Child.

1402
01:26:19,643 --> 01:26:20,801
What?

1403
01:26:21,746 --> 01:26:23,697
Did you have a job before all this?

1404
01:26:23,777 --> 01:26:26,623
We were breaking a few bones,
causing trouble!

1405
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:29,467
Collecting racketeering money
and we even raced pigeons.

1406
01:26:29,547 --> 01:26:30,710
Is that a job, Anna?

1407
01:26:30,789 --> 01:26:34,310
You have been acting cocky ever
since I returned from the jail.

1408
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:37,903
Not for me. What job can you do?
- I wll do any job! - Any job?

1409
01:26:37,983 --> 01:26:39,284
I wll do any job!

1410
01:26:39,363 --> 01:26:41,823
So we wll get you a
painting job with Murali?

1411
01:26:41,904 --> 01:26:45,079
But painting is an artist's job.

1412
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,193
I can not do that!

1413
01:26:46,274 --> 01:26:47,901
You paint the place red
when you hit people.

1414
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:50,318
But that is not the same, idiot!

1415
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:51,947
There is a mechanic in our area.
Mani.

1416
01:26:52,027 --> 01:26:53,886
You can chase him
out and do his job.

1417
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:57,251
Chasing out part, I can do..
but mechanic's work..

1418
01:26:57,331 --> 01:26:58,951
But I do not know about unscrewing,
screwing and all that.

1419
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,202
You said you wll do any job!

1420
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:02,333
You are only naming
jobs that I can not do.

1421
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:05,481
Remember sister Rani? We
seized an auto from her husband..

1422
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:07,582
..when he failed to pay up.
That auto is still with us.

1423
01:27:09,354 --> 01:27:12,806
That is correct! - We wll dismantle
and sell the parts? - No!

1424
01:27:12,984 --> 01:27:14,259
We wll drive the auto!

1425
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,641
Just talking about it will not do!
You need to know how to ride one.

1426
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:19,942
Come here.

1427
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:23,162
You never game me so much respect.
- I will tell. Come and sit.

1428
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:25,010
Tell me. -Sit down!

1429
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:28,302
What is the matter?
- The auto..

1430
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:30,533
You are mocking me?

1431
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:32,323
Auto.. you can drive.

1432
01:27:32,634 --> 01:27:36,060
Say something.
- Shall we? - You can drive.

1433
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:38,672
So are driving auto drive tomorrow.

1434
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:08,166
Super, Maari! You go. Be careful.
- Sit in the auto. - It is okay. - Get in!

1435
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:09,695
Get in!
- You too come.

1436
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:13,353
Get in! Get in!

1437
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,945
This is strange!

1438
01:28:27,572 --> 01:28:29,087
Want to take the auto?

1439
01:28:29,238 --> 01:28:31,173
No, Anna. - Where are you headed?
- Dhaba Gardens.

1440
01:28:31,371 --> 01:28:34,371
Will not take the auto to Dhaba Gardens?
- I will take the bus. - Get in.

1441
01:28:34,451 --> 01:28:37,149
No, Anna. - Get in. - There
is a graveyard nearby. - Get in.

1442
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:41,440
Get in! - Anna! - Right!

1443
01:28:53,413 --> 01:28:55,032
Stop it!

1444
01:28:55,654 --> 01:28:57,121
Give us the amount.

1445
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:59,983
How much, Anna?
- Just give me that! - Anna.

1446
01:29:00,063 --> 01:29:01,399
Anna! Anna! - Leave!

1447
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:04,273
Please be generous.
- Okay, carry on.

1448
01:29:05,518 --> 01:29:08,425
Anna! - Stop!

1449
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:11,757
Get in... go sit inside.

1450
01:29:11,837 --> 01:29:13,827
Get in.

1451
01:29:14,367 --> 01:29:16,207
Auto, huh?
- Of course it is an auto.

1452
01:29:16,287 --> 01:29:18,092
Get in.

1453
01:29:18,172 --> 01:29:21,579
Sir, I have come on my bike.
- I said get in. - Maari.

1454
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,461
Get in I say! - Sir, sir..

1455
01:29:24,786 --> 01:29:27,737
Get in I say! Will not you listen!

1456
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:30,134
Squeeze in! Push in!

1457
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:32,822
Stop! He wants to ride
in some other auto!

1458
01:29:32,902 --> 01:29:34,266
What are you doing?
- Anna! - Get down!

1459
01:29:34,346 --> 01:29:37,826
Get in! - Anna.. - Get in I say!

1460
01:29:38,663 --> 01:29:41,367
Keep going, do not stop!

1461
01:29:44,756 --> 01:29:47,105
Maari, they are refusing
to accept our entry.

1462
01:29:47,185 --> 01:29:48,724
Have a word with them.

1463
01:29:50,233 --> 01:29:53,769
The entry time is up, Maari. They have
said not to accept any more entries.

1464
01:29:53,947 --> 01:29:57,074
That is not a big deal at all. Call
Murthy Anna. We wll talk to him.

1465
01:29:57,154 --> 01:29:58,814
He is not the current president.

1466
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:02,280
If you want to register after
the last date, talk to the new president.

1467
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,989
Here he comes. Talk to him.

1468
01:30:05,069 --> 01:30:07,282
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

1469
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:12,650
Hello, Maari.
You have come to register?

1470
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:14,054
The last date is over.

1471
01:30:14,134 --> 01:30:17,126
You should have come sooner.
Oh, I am sorry!

1472
01:30:17,323 --> 01:30:19,306
You were in the jail, right?
Okay, okay.

1473
01:30:19,386 --> 01:30:22,085
What do we do?
- I do not know, sir.

1474
01:30:22,164 --> 01:30:26,613
I said there is a chance if
they request you. - That is true.

1475
01:30:26,778 --> 01:30:29,139
Ask them to request, then.
- Request?

1476
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:32,179
This dirty face? - Hey!
- Maari, we wll see next year.

1477
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:35,498
Shani, do not play up.
- I am saying it openly.

1478
01:30:35,578 --> 01:30:37,383
It is our turn in this area now.

1479
01:30:40,886 --> 01:30:44,034
Are you flying your birds
this year, "Bird" Ravi? - Yes.

1480
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,383
Okay, that is nice.
- What are you grinning for?

1481
01:30:50,804 --> 01:30:52,161
That is nothing. Forget about it.

1482
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,890
I asked you why you were grinning!

1483
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:57,586
Look at that board.

1484
01:31:00,103 --> 01:31:02,515
You must wish to see
your name there, sometime.

1485
01:31:02,595 --> 01:31:04,855
That is not possible if I compete.
So go ahead.

1486
01:31:04,935 --> 01:31:07,490
You think I can not
compete with your birds?

1487
01:31:08,398 --> 01:31:11,342
The whole world knows that.
Raising your voice will not change it.

1488
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:13,860
We wll let you win this time.

1489
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:15,619
Hey!

1490
01:31:16,153 --> 01:31:17,421
Take his entry.

1491
01:31:17,501 --> 01:31:19,453
We wll see who wins.

1492
01:31:19,533 --> 01:31:23,173
No, I wll let you have it this time.
- You are competing.

1493
01:31:23,387 --> 01:31:24,899
Come.

1494
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:29,463
Why is he requesting
so much? - Yes.

1495
01:31:29,543 --> 01:31:31,894
You heard the President.
Take our entry!

1496
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:39,251
We prevented him from participating
so that you could win.

1497
01:31:39,331 --> 01:31:40,672
He knew you would fall for it..

1498
01:31:40,752 --> 01:31:43,625
..if he teased you.
And you fell for it!

1499
01:31:43,704 --> 01:31:45,063
You only gave him entry.

1500
01:31:45,143 --> 01:31:46,525
Let it be.

1501
01:31:46,605 --> 01:31:48,702
His pigeons are three
months behind ours in training.

1502
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:51,859
He does not have any money to feed
them special food and medicines.

1503
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:55,369
We have readied our pigeons
with imported medicines and tonics.

1504
01:31:55,534 --> 01:31:57,322
We have been training
them for four months!

1505
01:31:57,403 --> 01:31:58,985
This year is ours.

1506
01:31:59,065 --> 01:32:01,367
You have been doing
all this for years now.

1507
01:32:02,185 --> 01:32:04,134
Why have you never won?

1508
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:08,699
You can not win unless you
admit the opponent's strengths.

1509
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:10,736
Even if he starts
training them late..

1510
01:32:11,173 --> 01:32:14,024
..even if he trains them with
just water. His pigeons will win.

1511
01:32:14,242 --> 01:32:17,810
That is Maari. That is why
I told you not to let him enter.

1512
01:32:17,975 --> 01:32:21,035
What do you even
know about pigeons?

1513
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:23,440
Wait and watch.

1514
01:32:23,922 --> 01:32:25,429
As the race day draws closer..

1515
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:28,364
..you wll get nervous
and ask me for help.

1516
01:32:28,613 --> 01:32:30,212
It will happen.

1517
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:36,975
Do not stare at the pigeon after
feeding it. He can not digest his food.

1518
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:41,426
Anna, you told them to train them.
Pigeons are ready.

1519
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:44,849
Anna.. - Hey..
Why are you hitting him?

1520
01:32:45,248 --> 01:32:47,622
He asked me not to come.
But I came anyway.

1521
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:50,530
You do good to others
secretly, right?

1522
01:32:50,728 --> 01:32:53,336
You have been paying
Kavitha's school fees..

1523
01:32:53,742 --> 01:32:55,664
..without anybody's knowledge.

1524
01:32:55,944 --> 01:32:59,008
Who? Our Loudspeaker Kavitha?
You never told us!

1525
01:33:00,436 --> 01:33:02,173
Why do you refuse to reveal..

1526
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:04,603
..the good in you?

1527
01:33:04,784 --> 01:33:06,711
It is fine if you
do not want to accept.

1528
01:33:07,728 --> 01:33:12,432
I knew there is a good guy in there,
somewhere.

1529
01:33:13,028 --> 01:33:14,646
Now I have seen that.

1530
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:18,105
And that is enough.
Even if you keep chasing me away..

1531
01:33:18,304 --> 01:33:20,333
..I wll keep coming back to help.

1532
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:26,664
You have helped me enough, already.

1533
01:33:26,814 --> 01:33:29,234
What are you trying to get from me,
by fawning this way?

1534
01:33:29,626 --> 01:33:32,369
Why do you like it
so much to be a bad guy?

1535
01:33:32,893 --> 01:33:34,797
I had rather be a pure bad guy..

1536
01:33:34,877 --> 01:33:36,646
..than an adulterated good guy.

1537
01:33:46,225 --> 01:33:48,845
Ask the street vendors to pay up.

1538
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:51,613
Do not leave out anyone.

1539
01:33:51,873 --> 01:33:54,417
Pay up! Quickly!

1540
01:33:55,103 --> 01:33:57,546
Pay.
- Here.

1541
01:33:58,523 --> 01:34:02,519
Greetings, Anna. - Take it out.
What are you staring at?

1542
01:34:02,891 --> 01:34:04,898
What a measly amount!

1543
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:13,055
Have all the auto drivers paid up?
- Yes, all of them but he did not pay.

1544
01:34:17,306 --> 01:34:20,568
Since when does
Maari drive an auto?

1545
01:34:20,797 --> 01:34:23,724
Why has not he paid?
He refuses to join the union.

1546
01:34:23,923 --> 01:34:26,096
He refused and you accepted?

1547
01:34:26,756 --> 01:34:28,907
Pay up, man.

1548
01:34:31,152 --> 01:34:34,438
Pay up nicely or we wll make you.

1549
01:35:03,228 --> 01:35:04,381
Hey..

1550
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:14,789
Go.

1551
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:17,145
Go!

1552
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:21,914
"Maari is back!"

1553
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:24,389
"Maari is a fireball."

1554
01:35:24,872 --> 01:35:27,151
"Now he is back.
Bigger and better."

1555
01:35:27,635 --> 01:35:31,302
"Better take to your heels."

1556
01:35:35,155 --> 01:35:36,862
You wll take it?

1557
01:35:37,978 --> 01:35:40,038
Will you take it and
reach home in a piece?

1558
01:35:40,118 --> 01:35:45,450
"Your face will get mangled, eyes
removed, shape beyond recognition."

1559
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:48,307
Bloody bugger!

1560
01:35:48,387 --> 01:35:50,934
"He will cross all his limits."

1561
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,360
Hello!
- That is Maari.

1562
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,597
How much?
- No, it is fine.

1563
01:35:59,677 --> 01:36:01,247
"That is Maari."

1564
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:04,083
"Maari is back!"

1565
01:36:04,922 --> 01:36:06,905
"Maari is a fireball."

1566
01:36:07,618 --> 01:36:09,764
"He is back!"

1567
01:36:10,284 --> 01:36:12,027
"Take to your heels."

1568
01:36:12,304 --> 01:36:13,787
Maari..

1569
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:17,100
Still scared of him?

1570
01:36:17,346 --> 01:36:20,045
You should have beat him
up and collected the money.

1571
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,877
Easy for you to say.
We are the one who got beat up.

1572
01:36:23,512 --> 01:36:25,125
It is nothing, sir.

1573
01:36:25,204 --> 01:36:27,497
Let it go. Does not matter
if one guy does not pay.

1574
01:36:28,096 --> 01:36:30,306
Why do you think we collect?

1575
01:36:30,615 --> 01:36:32,217
Is it a major source of income?

1576
01:36:32,463 --> 01:36:34,304
Even they are struggling to pay us.

1577
01:36:34,836 --> 01:36:36,703
We are collecting to..

1578
01:36:36,783 --> 01:36:38,463
..keep them under control.

1579
01:36:38,828 --> 01:36:40,081
Even if one person refuses to pay..

1580
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:43,134
..that fear will subside.
Can not let that happen.

1581
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:45,260
Need to fix it tomorrow!

1582
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:49,347
The chains were a lot heavier
before I went to prison.

1583
01:36:50,365 --> 01:36:51,862
Now it is all light.

1584
01:36:52,007 --> 01:36:55,269
He was roaming around with them!
- Roaming? - I had it in my house, man.

1585
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:59,046
Maari is the most bejewelled
auto driver in this area.

1586
01:36:59,126 --> 01:37:00,909
Anna, look who is here.

1587
01:37:05,171 --> 01:37:09,177
Maari drives an auto?

1588
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:14,657
I was expecting complaints that he is
doing rowdyism and causing trouble.

1589
01:37:14,738 --> 01:37:16,673
But he is just driving an auto?

1590
01:37:17,148 --> 01:37:20,552
What is it, Maari?
Heard you refused to pay the fee?

1591
01:37:20,711 --> 01:37:23,615
Caught up in the past, were you?

1592
01:37:23,939 --> 01:37:26,105
You are a nobody now.

1593
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:28,367
Get that in your head first.

1594
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:31,461
If I am a nobody..

1595
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:33,826
..what drove you to come here?

1596
01:37:33,905 --> 01:37:35,573
I meant, your jeep.

1597
01:37:36,676 --> 01:37:39,342
Looks like a bit of the old Maari
is left in the auto-guy somewhere.

1598
01:37:41,493 --> 01:37:44,939
Should not be. Drop your cigarette.

1599
01:37:46,202 --> 01:37:48,284
Drop it!

1600
01:37:50,186 --> 01:37:53,510
Sir, why are you hitting him?
Careful, Maari!

1601
01:38:03,135 --> 01:38:06,047
Maari, listen. He is a cop.
Let is not cause trouble. Sir, sir.

1602
01:38:06,127 --> 01:38:08,715
Sir, we will not cause trouble.
-Trying to slither away?

1603
01:38:09,896 --> 01:38:12,855
Sir, do not hit him.
Please listen to us.

1604
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:15,474
Do not hit him.

1605
01:38:17,846 --> 01:38:19,154
Sir..

1606
01:38:20,471 --> 01:38:27,960
No, sir. Do not hit him!
Please listen, sir.

1607
01:38:28,643 --> 01:38:31,791
Sir, please tell them to stop.

1608
01:38:31,871 --> 01:38:35,042
Stop hitting!

1609
01:38:35,122 --> 01:38:39,478
Sir, please tell them to stop.
- Okay, that is enough. Stop!

1610
01:38:42,323 --> 01:38:46,009
I am the boss here from now. Okay?

1611
01:38:46,154 --> 01:38:49,030
Either run away with your pigeons.

1612
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:51,677
Or lie low with your
tail between your legs.

1613
01:38:51,818 --> 01:38:54,534
I wll come hit you
whenever I am bored.

1614
01:38:54,613 --> 01:38:56,913
You are my Punching Bag now.

1615
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,404
Hey, give me a cigarette.

1616
01:39:09,123 --> 01:39:10,337
So..

1617
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:14,615
When a mosquito bites a sleeping
man, it does not make it a hero.

1618
01:39:14,994 --> 01:39:18,829
One fine day, if it bites him when
he is awake, it will die in one shot.

1619
01:39:18,909 --> 01:39:20,739
One fine day..

1620
01:39:32,069 --> 01:39:33,808
Maari

1621
01:39:33,889 --> 01:39:37,288
He comes in his cop uniform,
owing we can not hit him then.

1622
01:39:37,484 --> 01:39:39,127
If only he dared
to come without it!

1623
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:41,145
We should not keep
quiet anymore, Maari.

1624
01:39:41,354 --> 01:39:42,717
Just say the word and..

1625
01:39:42,926 --> 01:39:44,481
..we will deal with
him in other ways.

1626
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,867
We need to get Velu
Anna released first.

1627
01:39:48,948 --> 01:39:50,962
How will that cop let that happen?

1628
01:39:54,649 --> 01:39:56,573
Leave! Why are you
taking me away? - Come.

1629
01:39:56,653 --> 01:39:59,132
Leave!
- Come, come.

1630
01:39:59,212 --> 01:40:02,127
Maari, I do not know anything.
I did not help him intentionally.

1631
01:40:02,261 --> 01:40:05,815
I thought he was a nice guy.
I am not on his side. - Hey..

1632
01:40:06,682 --> 01:40:08,899
I need some information
to lock him.

1633
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:11,559
You know all about
the frauds he is committed?

1634
01:40:12,219 --> 01:40:13,539
Tell me.

1635
01:40:13,965 --> 01:40:15,728
I had lose my job if he found out.

1636
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:19,264
If you do not tell him, you wll lose
your life. Is that okay? - Tell!

1637
01:40:19,618 --> 01:40:21,693
I do not know his
lorry routes, Maari.

1638
01:40:21,845 --> 01:40:25,773
But I do know one thing. To avoid the
checking that happens in all the tolls...

1639
01:40:25,963 --> 01:40:28,020
He uses travels vehicles
to carry small loads.

1640
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:30,451
I know some of these routes, Maari.

1641
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:41,444
Looks like the customs guys.
We are caught!

1642
01:40:50,601 --> 01:40:51,726
You!

1643
01:40:53,912 --> 01:40:56,039
Yes, we got it, sir.
- Means?

1644
01:40:56,119 --> 01:40:58,692
Thieves are caught!
- Open the door!

1645
01:40:58,832 --> 01:41:01,034
Bloody hell. - What?

1646
01:41:02,929 --> 01:41:04,322
Bullshit!

1647
01:41:10,599 --> 01:41:13,202
Hello? - Sir, the press and
media have come to the station.

1648
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,639
Did you call them?
- What, the press?

1649
01:41:16,585 --> 01:41:18,564
We will give the entire
details of it very soon.

1650
01:41:18,716 --> 01:41:22,188
Inquiry is underway. - Sir, how
did you receive the information?

1651
01:41:30,579 --> 01:41:33,201
Officer Arjun is here! Catch him!

1652
01:41:34,376 --> 01:41:36,012
Click photo!

1653
01:41:42,435 --> 01:41:44,587
He is done so much,
but acts like he is done nothing.

1654
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,377
Thank you, officer Arjun.

1655
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:48,612
You have made our jobs easier.

1656
01:41:48,752 --> 01:41:51,601
How much you have contributed!
-He does that a lot, sir.

1657
01:41:52,337 --> 01:41:54,481
Keep up the good work.
- Thank you, sir.

1658
01:41:54,811 --> 01:41:56,608
Come here.

1659
01:41:56,689 --> 01:41:57,777
What is going on?

1660
01:41:57,856 --> 01:41:59,832
Sir, this is your doing, right?

1661
01:41:59,912 --> 01:42:02,009
You are so great!
- What?

1662
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:05,332
When I came in the morning, the
smuggled wood and the smugglers..

1663
01:42:05,412 --> 01:42:06,467
..were outside the station.

1664
01:42:06,547 --> 01:42:11,648
I thought you caught them as usual
and called the Revenue Department.

1665
01:42:12,023 --> 01:42:15,675
Are you out of your mind?
- Not so loud, sir! - Sir, look here.

1666
01:42:17,356 --> 01:42:19,376
I did not do it.

1667
01:42:19,456 --> 01:42:22,936
Who else? How do you
get it right every time, sir?

1668
01:42:26,161 --> 01:42:28,935
You are a smart one, sir.
Right? - Maari..

1669
01:42:29,015 --> 01:42:30,669
He is so right every time..

1670
01:42:30,748 --> 01:42:33,594
..almost like he is
the one transporting it! - No!

1671
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:36,919
He is a very nice guy!

1672
01:42:38,568 --> 01:42:42,097
Wondering why your own
goods are in your station?

1673
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:45,289
You are not in control,
as you think, officer!

1674
01:42:45,429 --> 01:42:48,171
I stand to lose nothing with this.

1675
01:42:48,577 --> 01:42:51,052
Red sanders is transported
to Tamil Nadu from Andhra.

1676
01:42:51,934 --> 01:42:54,275
It is all happening..

1677
01:42:55,037 --> 01:42:56,985
Somebody has given..

1678
01:42:58,655 --> 01:43:02,640
It is not just the goods that were caught.
Your men were caught with it.

1679
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,711
Upon enquiry, he is willing to talk.
He could talk to the Revenue Officers, too.

1680
01:43:05,792 --> 01:43:10,565
Think about what would happen to
you then. The Press is here, too.

1681
01:43:11,573 --> 01:43:15,787
This was the mosquito that bit me
when I was asleep the other day, right?

1682
01:43:16,194 --> 01:43:17,450
What did I tell you?

1683
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:20,143
I told you, if I wake up one day and
hit you once, you will die immediately.

1684
01:43:20,224 --> 01:43:23,837
Did I say or not?
- Yes, Maari. - Right?

1685
01:43:25,225 --> 01:43:27,143
What do you want?

1686
01:43:28,215 --> 01:43:29,980
Release Velu Anna.

1687
01:43:30,176 --> 01:43:32,422
How is that possible?
We have got evidence.

1688
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:38,293
Like you need lessons in deceit,
officer!

1689
01:43:38,373 --> 01:43:41,561
Get one of your own men to surrender
and get Velu Anna out or else..

1690
01:43:41,641 --> 01:43:42,742
Sannasi!

1691
01:43:42,823 --> 01:43:43,606
Present, sir!

1692
01:43:44,956 --> 01:43:47,833
Just checking!
How did you do it, sir?

1693
01:43:47,913 --> 01:43:52,701
It was superb. The area
has been better since you came.

1694
01:43:53,762 --> 01:43:56,635
Ask him one by one,
he wll answer patiently.

1695
01:43:56,715 --> 01:43:58,685
May I leave, officer?

1696
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:01,414
Move, move. Careful,
do not share it on WhatsApp!

1697
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,421
"That is Maari."

1698
01:44:05,009 --> 01:44:06,279
"That is Maari."

1699
01:44:08,908 --> 01:44:11,237
Maari!

1700
01:44:15,274 --> 01:44:17,094
"Maari."
- Release Velu?

1701
01:44:17,411 --> 01:44:18,966
Do not do it, man.

1702
01:44:19,149 --> 01:44:20,339
You have been an enemy all along.

1703
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,347
But I was an insider
who betrayed their trust.

1704
01:44:22,427 --> 01:44:24,306
He would be very
pissed off with me.

1705
01:44:24,386 --> 01:44:28,569
Not just that, Maari's position will
get even stronger if Velu is out.

1706
01:44:28,911 --> 01:44:31,640
What can I do?
Want me to get arrested, instead?

1707
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,320
Your man has been
caught red-handed.

1708
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,911
This was the one thing you had to do.
And you have screwed that up, too.

1709
01:44:39,067 --> 01:44:40,247
Do not take tension unnecessarily.

1710
01:44:40,328 --> 01:44:43,168
We wll all get locked in if we are caught.
- That is why I am telling you,

1711
01:44:43,247 --> 01:44:44,902
Velu has to be released.

1712
01:44:44,981 --> 01:44:48,182
Velu has lost his political
support after he went to jail.

1713
01:44:48,262 --> 01:44:50,103
Even if he is released now..

1714
01:44:50,182 --> 01:44:53,993
He can not touch a
policeman without support.

1715
01:44:54,166 --> 01:44:55,886
You are police.. okay..

1716
01:44:55,966 --> 01:44:58,203
What if he targets us?

1717
01:44:58,456 --> 01:45:02,172
That is your problem. - Sir,
you are disassociating yourself?

1718
01:45:02,664 --> 01:45:04,711
Look, it is your
man who is been caught.

1719
01:45:04,988 --> 01:45:07,344
I can still get you
in trouble and escape.

1720
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:10,170
Be happy that I have not done that.

1721
01:45:10,527 --> 01:45:13,619
Try to transport the
goods safely from now.

1722
01:45:16,444 --> 01:45:18,983
What is happening, Anna?
He is saying such things.

1723
01:45:19,378 --> 01:45:21,625
And there is no respect these days.

1724
01:45:22,109 --> 01:45:23,789
We need to be careful with him.

1725
01:45:33,595 --> 01:45:38,800
Move aside!
- Greetings. - Velu Anna has come!

1726
01:45:40,065 --> 01:45:42,706
Come, Maari. Put the garland.

1727
01:45:43,347 --> 01:45:45,720
Greetings, Anna.

1728
01:45:55,153 --> 01:45:59,646
Father.
- Hey.. Son..

1729
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,191
I told you not to go there!
You did not listen to me.

1730
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:06,195
Are you okay? - I am okay, dad.
- How did you get released?

1731
01:46:06,275 --> 01:46:07,925
They released Velu Annan first.

1732
01:46:08,006 --> 01:46:11,163
Then they said it was the
same case and released all of us.

1733
01:46:11,243 --> 01:46:13,240
Maari is the cause for our release.
- Okay.

1734
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,614
When I heard that you had been released..

1735
01:46:15,694 --> 01:46:17,431
..I knew you had get me out somehow.

1736
01:46:17,716 --> 01:46:19,807
But why did you use this evidence?

1737
01:46:19,887 --> 01:46:22,992
It is gone waste! - You are out
of prison. What more do we need?

1738
01:46:23,753 --> 01:46:28,069
If we had gone to Revenue Department,
we could have gotten back at him.

1739
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:29,949
Or even finished him completely.

1740
01:46:30,029 --> 01:46:32,726
Think I wll let the guy
who got you locked up get away?

1741
01:46:32,806 --> 01:46:36,011
I wll take special care of him.
You forget about it, Anna.

1742
01:46:36,091 --> 01:46:39,002
Tomorrow is the festival of lights.
And you are out of prison!

1743
01:46:39,082 --> 01:46:41,890
You just watch our
atrocity in our area today!

1744
01:46:44,381 --> 01:46:46,007
So, I am going to the barber..
- Barber..

1745
01:46:46,087 --> 01:46:47,667
You do not have any hair.
Why do you need a hair cut?

1746
01:46:47,747 --> 01:46:49,606
Go! Go!
- I am happy, Maari.

1747
01:46:49,748 --> 01:46:52,246
Because of you everyone
got released. - What?

1748
01:46:53,789 --> 01:46:56,420
What a pity!
- Who got your men out?

1749
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,877
I only got Velu Annan out.

1750
01:46:57,957 --> 01:47:01,619
You were just free add ons.
Get out!

1751
01:47:01,698 --> 01:47:03,340
Hi, dude!
- Hi!

1752
01:47:04,203 --> 01:47:06,386
Look at all the reverence.
- Salute, Maari.

1753
01:47:06,514 --> 01:47:09,971
How is it going, man? - Fine, man.
- Give me a hi-5, man. - Cool!

1754
01:47:10,051 --> 01:47:11,433
You fool.

1755
01:47:16,942 --> 01:47:19,112
They are here?
It is the festival of lights indeed.

1756
01:47:19,192 --> 01:47:20,590
Start collecting in all the shops.

1757
01:47:27,047 --> 01:47:29,085
Go to the street vendor.

1758
01:47:40,829 --> 01:47:42,649
What, they are back?

1759
01:47:42,729 --> 01:47:45,333
Pay up the money.
- It is festival time.

1760
01:47:45,413 --> 01:47:47,172
So what if it is festival time?

1761
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:48,324
Pay up!

1762
01:47:51,122 --> 01:47:52,747
Pay up, man.

1763
01:47:55,336 --> 01:47:57,936
Anna, pay up. I want to go home!

1764
01:48:05,007 --> 01:48:07,643
It is not unusual to collect,
right, Maari?

1765
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:10,978
Poor fellow.

1766
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:14,893
There!

1767
01:48:17,645 --> 01:48:19,686
Anna, at least you pay up, please?

1768
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:21,904
"Maari is different now."

1769
01:49:22,643 --> 01:49:24,912
"Maari is more stronger."

1770
01:49:25,833 --> 01:49:28,086
You are wearing make up?

1771
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:32,680
Oldie, walk away or I wll
light up this cracker on you.

1772
01:49:32,971 --> 01:49:34,501
Hey! You!

1773
01:49:34,581 --> 01:49:36,559
Come, I am going.

1774
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:39,745
That is Maari for you!

1775
01:49:40,947 --> 01:49:41,993
Poor girl.

1776
01:49:48,734 --> 01:49:52,282
This is the usual amount.
Return this back to them.

1777
01:49:56,565 --> 01:49:58,863
Festival wishes to you!
- Same to you.

1778
01:49:58,944 --> 01:50:00,712
Bye!
- Bye!

1779
01:50:42,649 --> 01:50:48,893
"I know it looks crooked, my path.
All you straight-forward guys, get out!"

1780
01:50:48,974 --> 01:50:55,125
"It might feel a bit wrong but
it is right. This is Maari's style."

1781
01:50:55,204 --> 01:51:01,670
"This light of our lives Is Maari the
Great! Even the police salute him!"

1782
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:08,440
"Stay if you want to.
Or walk away. Good times are here!"

1783
01:52:05,443 --> 01:52:08,541
"Bend over and people
stab you in the back."

1784
01:52:08,621 --> 01:52:11,704
"So stand tall.
That is the only life hack."

1785
01:52:11,784 --> 01:52:14,917
"When finding a partner
is like finding trouble."

1786
01:52:14,997 --> 01:52:18,111
"Being a loner
makes so much sense."

1787
01:52:18,192 --> 01:52:24,134
"Do not you say such things, son.
We are one, now and forever."

1788
01:52:24,213 --> 01:52:27,296
"Do what feels right."

1789
01:52:27,376 --> 01:52:30,798
"The doors to my home are open,
for you."

1790
01:52:30,878 --> 01:52:37,175
"I was born alone, I wll die alone.
I do not need any family."

1791
01:52:37,256 --> 01:52:43,673
"Her words oozed honey,
she came into my life."

1792
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:02,340
"I know it looks crooked, my path.
All you straight-forward guys, get out!"

1793
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:08,675
"It might feel a bit wrong but
it is right. This is Maari's style."

1794
01:53:08,755 --> 01:53:15,038
"This light of our lives Is Maari the
Great! Even the police salute him!"

1795
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:22,277
"Stay if you want to.
Or walk away. Good times are here!"

1796
01:53:42,409 --> 01:53:45,086
Have the birds
returned from training?

1797
01:53:45,167 --> 01:53:47,962
We flew fifty,
only twenty have returned.

1798
01:53:49,009 --> 01:53:50,284
What about Maari's?

1799
01:53:50,538 --> 01:53:51,890
He flew thirty.

1800
01:53:52,195 --> 01:53:53,733
All thirty have returned.

1801
01:53:55,113 --> 01:53:56,467
What is funny?

1802
01:53:57,529 --> 01:53:59,205
I told you the other day.

1803
01:53:59,997 --> 01:54:02,763
That you had come to me for
help as the race draws closer.

1804
01:54:03,755 --> 01:54:05,585
What can you do for me?

1805
01:54:06,645 --> 01:54:11,140
He can not participate without his birds.
- No, do not do that. Be quiet.

1806
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:13,934
You do not understand the seriousness
of pigeon fancying business.

1807
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:17,957
Make sure he does not do anything.

1808
01:54:20,161 --> 01:54:22,764
Officer Arjun,
you have done so much for us.

1809
01:54:22,844 --> 01:54:26,600
Let us handle this.
- Who says I am doing this for you?

1810
01:54:28,117 --> 01:54:31,761
He should feel pain.
We need to hit him where it hurts.

1811
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,210
Do not do anything without
Ravi Anna's consent.

1812
01:54:35,859 --> 01:54:37,502
It is already done.

1813
01:54:49,617 --> 01:54:50,894
Hey!

1814
01:56:16,979 --> 01:56:20,628
Maari..
Ten of our pigeons are dead.

1815
01:56:21,342 --> 01:56:23,921
They have set it on fire
when we were not around.

1816
01:56:24,136 --> 01:56:26,797
It was that girl Sridevi, who opened
the cages and saved the pigeons.

1817
01:56:27,011 --> 01:56:29,902
If it was not for her,
all the birds would be dead.

1818
01:56:30,266 --> 01:56:32,893
She burnt hands while
trying to save the birds.

1819
01:56:33,457 --> 01:56:35,900
She was here when
they burnt the cage.

1820
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:38,780
If she had not been there,
all the birds would be dead.

1821
01:56:41,144 --> 01:56:45,103
They say pigeons never
return to a burnt cage.

1822
01:56:45,364 --> 01:56:49,134
They would have gotten scared. Our
pigeons will never return, Anna.

1823
01:56:50,908 --> 01:56:53,336
Maari, do not mistake
me for saying this.

1824
01:56:53,717 --> 01:56:55,581
Let is leave this place.

1825
01:56:55,662 --> 01:56:57,463
There is nothing here for us.

1826
01:56:57,779 --> 01:56:59,141
Why should we suffer here?

1827
01:56:59,538 --> 01:57:03,211
Velu Anna is back now.
Let him deal with the police.

1828
01:57:03,457 --> 01:57:05,273
What do we gain in these fights?

1829
01:57:05,497 --> 01:57:07,837
If pigeons were furious
then they could have attacked us.

1830
01:57:08,167 --> 01:57:11,224
What did the poor birds do to them?
I know you wll refuse to leave.

1831
01:57:12,002 --> 01:57:14,493
But, it hurts to see
you like this. Maari.

1832
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:15,994
Let is get out of here.

1833
01:57:16,596 --> 01:57:20,167
Sannasi, pack our things
and get the vehicle ready.

1834
01:57:21,819 --> 01:57:23,255
Go!

1835
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:34,717
Shani, see there.

1836
01:58:40,914 --> 01:58:42,886
You said pigeons do not
return to a burnt cage.

1837
01:58:44,769 --> 01:58:46,252
How did they return?

1838
01:58:47,698 --> 01:58:50,104
The birds know this is their home.

1839
01:58:50,461 --> 01:58:52,047
But you do not realise it.

1840
01:58:54,904 --> 01:58:56,713
This has to end today.

1841
01:58:58,813 --> 01:59:00,640
I told you not to do anything!

1842
01:59:00,773 --> 01:59:02,641
Everyone found out that
we set fire to his loft.

1843
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:05,398
I have been banned from
pigeon racing altogether!

1844
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:07,887
What about it?

1845
01:59:09,738 --> 01:59:13,037
My dignity is lost!
I can not race pigeons anymore.

1846
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:14,490
Stop yelling!

1847
01:59:14,570 --> 01:59:17,229
Following my word got you this far.

1848
01:59:17,771 --> 01:59:19,853
So what if you can not race?

1849
01:59:20,233 --> 01:59:22,108
Playing with pigeons.

1850
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:23,471
You will not understand that.

1851
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:25,521
It is an ancestral sport.

1852
01:59:25,654 --> 01:59:27,337
You are following
his instructions now?

1853
01:59:27,417 --> 01:59:29,417
Anna, do not just hit me!

1854
01:59:29,597 --> 01:59:32,353
You are just a label.
Who plots the action?

1855
01:59:32,667 --> 01:59:34,621
It is our Officer Arjun.

1856
01:59:35,096 --> 01:59:38,408
So you are supporting him? Fools..

1857
01:59:38,619 --> 01:59:40,043
Do you know what you have done?

1858
01:59:40,123 --> 01:59:42,733
Do you know what Maari would do
if you lay a finger on his pigeons?

1859
01:59:42,813 --> 01:59:46,376
What is happening? - He was
just waiting for the right moment.

1860
01:59:46,456 --> 01:59:49,119
You have taunted him. He will come!

1861
01:59:57,563 --> 02:00:00,440
Fire!

1862
02:01:03,764 --> 02:01:05,224
Maari!

1863
02:01:07,212 --> 02:01:09,210
Maari!

1864
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,396
Maari!

1865
02:01:14,682 --> 02:01:17,756
Maari!

1866
02:01:29,168 --> 02:01:30,427
Maari, listen to me!

1867
02:01:34,756 --> 02:01:35,981
Do not do this, Maari.

1868
02:01:43,606 --> 02:01:48,041
I only kept quiet this
long as you were a cop.

1869
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:50,569
But you have touched my pigeons.

1870
02:01:50,854 --> 02:01:53,342
I wll kill you and
go to prison again.

1871
02:01:53,422 --> 02:01:55,282
Coward!

1872
02:01:59,445 --> 02:02:01,095
I am sorry, Maari.

1873
02:03:21,405 --> 02:03:24,077
Maari, wait! Listen to me.

1874
02:03:24,354 --> 02:03:25,596
Wait, Maari.

1875
02:03:26,742 --> 02:03:28,592
Listen to me, Maari. Listen to me.

1876
02:03:28,882 --> 02:03:31,478
I forbade that policeman,
but he threatened us to do it.

1877
02:03:31,557 --> 02:03:33,877
I had nothing to do
with your loft burning.

1878
02:03:34,059 --> 02:03:35,373
I know all about the frauds
he is committed.

1879
02:03:35,453 --> 02:03:37,514
I am willing to testify anywhere,
anytime.

1880
02:03:37,664 --> 02:03:42,247
I do not even trust a good man.
Why would I trust filth like you?

1881
02:03:45,503 --> 02:03:46,757
You were saying?

1882
02:03:47,355 --> 02:03:49,471
You wll kill me and go to prison?

1883
02:03:50,702 --> 02:03:52,752
I wll say you killed
him for revenge and..

1884
02:03:52,832 --> 02:03:54,297
..get you locked up forever.

1885
02:04:06,259 --> 02:04:09,698
You crook!
I told you not to trust him.

1886
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:21,090
Round up everyone.
No one should escape.

1887
02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:45,259
Sir, hope you are fine.

1888
02:04:54,462 --> 02:04:57,158
What was that? You always say..

1889
02:04:57,719 --> 02:04:59,027
"I wll finish you off!"

1890
02:04:59,726 --> 02:05:02,983
See what I have done?
Now I have finished you.

1891
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:06,835
You wll spend the rest
of your life in prison.

1892
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:10,354
Drag him away.
- Come!

1893
02:05:10,434 --> 02:05:12,735
What are you doing?
That is not our man.

1894
02:05:12,815 --> 02:05:14,797
That is the man.
Get him. - Okay, sir.

1895
02:05:14,877 --> 02:05:16,764
Let me go. Sir.

1896
02:05:16,844 --> 02:05:18,181
Sir, why are you arresting me?

1897
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:19,889
Let me go.
- Stop.

1898
02:05:19,969 --> 02:05:21,849
They have told us what you do.

1899
02:05:36,541 --> 02:05:38,609
I have got a guy in
the Revenue Department.

1900
02:05:39,922 --> 02:05:41,605
I wll be restored to my old power.

1901
02:05:41,949 --> 02:05:47,039
All I need is an eye-witness
to everything that Arjun has committed.

1902
02:05:47,119 --> 02:05:49,856
Sir, I am not afraid,
with Maari and you by my side.

1903
02:05:50,006 --> 02:05:51,369
I am willing to talk openly.

1904
02:05:51,449 --> 02:05:54,113
Maari!

1905
02:05:57,010 --> 02:06:00,676
What did you say? You wll finish me?

1906
02:06:03,408 --> 02:06:05,850
That was nice.
You said it real nice.

1907
02:06:06,404 --> 02:06:08,679
And do not come out, okay?

1908
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:12,085
Just stay inside.
You wll be safer there.

1909
02:06:26,434 --> 02:06:28,056
Maari!

1910
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,345
Maari!

1911
02:06:34,262 --> 02:06:36,440
Maari!

1912
02:06:58,261 --> 02:07:01,053
Sub-Inspector Arjun
has been arrested by..

1913
02:07:01,132 --> 02:07:03,894
..Revenue Department
for smuggling red sanders.

1914
02:07:27,942 --> 02:07:29,800
I can not decide whether..

1915
02:07:29,992 --> 02:07:31,637
..you are a good guy or a bad guy.

1916
02:07:32,724 --> 02:07:35,305
Why do you doubt it?
Of course I am a bad guy!

1917
02:07:35,975 --> 02:07:39,497
Good guys can not be trusted.
They can turn bad at any point.

1918
02:07:39,577 --> 02:07:43,479
Men who appear to be good
but do bad, are even worse.

1919
02:07:43,559 --> 02:07:46,288
But a guy,
who openly claims to be bad..

1920
02:07:46,368 --> 02:07:49,207
..but does some good,
can be trusted.

1921
02:07:49,949 --> 02:07:51,559
I trust you.

1922
02:07:52,873 --> 02:07:54,358
So what?

1923
02:07:54,792 --> 02:07:57,253
I feel like a lie..

1924
02:07:57,332 --> 02:07:59,121
..from a long time back...

1925
02:07:59,202 --> 02:08:02,542
..has become the truth now.

1926
02:08:02,867 --> 02:08:06,039
I am serious. I really..

1927
02:08:06,251 --> 02:08:07,579
..do like you now.

1928
02:08:09,737 --> 02:08:15,015
Oh dear. No, madam.

1929
02:08:15,287 --> 02:08:20,641
This love thing will not suit
my character. I have got my pigeons..

1930
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:23,964
..my boys and I have got the area people
to trouble whenever I am bored.

1931
02:08:24,141 --> 02:08:27,309
I would be free and happy
like this all the time.

1932
02:08:27,389 --> 02:08:30,862
You think about it, we could
just be friends if you want.

1933
02:08:32,302 --> 02:08:34,703
Okay? Bye.
