unseen the unseen see there's heaven and

512
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:31,110
there's hell and in between there's

513
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:35,369
purgatory but just above purgatory is

514
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:38,399
the world of the unseen these are evil

515
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:42,119
entities that have their own sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

522
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:08,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">do they want me unlike other evil forces</font>

523
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:12,420
the gory nose needs to be summoned but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

524
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:17,010
didn't summon it yes you didn't but

525
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:20,789
somebody did somebody made a deal with

526
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:25,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and the reward was your soul</font>

527
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:28,409
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you turn 18 now what's so appealing</font>

528
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:35,099
about the gory knows it can grant you

529
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:37,379
one wish and returned for a soul so why

530
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:42,630
hasn't it already taken because it needs

531
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you this is a process the going nose has</font>

532
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:49,019
its own way of doing things first<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

533
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">stops you you won't even know it's there</font>

534
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:54,509
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it did but those</font>

535
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:58,150
weeks leading up to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> birthday and</font>

536
00:35:54,510 --> 00:36:02,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">then it makes this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presence</font>

537
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:04,389
it hurts you that would explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

538
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:09,699
strange stuff has been going down and

00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:18,159
but it's already left its mark there's

542
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:21,190
so what is that the good news were not

543
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,469
good news but the upside if you want to

544
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:27,818
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up fat if that's going to let</font>

545
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:31,389
you lay low for a while why so what you

01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:50,899
the doctors everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> just called it a</font>

1045

miracle and I mean the publicity was

1046
01:11:50,899 --> 01:11:56,569
awesome yeah it was but then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess you</font>

1047
01:11:52,970 --> 01:12:01,400
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I became contemplative</font>

it was a lie no one can recover from

1053
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:15,020
something like that and if they can they

1054
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:19,219
