Hollywood, California, city of contrasts.

19
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,726
Home to the rich and powerful...

20
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,605
yet so popular
with the broken and destitute.

21
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,900
Here sex hunger is reflected
in every aspect of daily life...

22
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,695
and instant gratification
is tirelessly pursued.

23
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,492
A center of casual violence
and capricious harassment...

24
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,870
where rampant vice and amorality...

25
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,413
permeate every strata of society...

26
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,334
and the barrier between food and sex
has totally dissolved.

27
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,882
It is a known fact that prolonged exposure
to just such a psychopathic environment...

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,304
will eventually warp
even the most normal and decent among us.

29
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,516
This then is the story of Hollywood today.

30
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,811
Not a pretty story,
but presented here exactly as it happened.

31
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,981
Really? Stomach cramps?

32
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,901
But it's such a good buy.

33
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,864
Well, so is lighter fluid at $1.50 a pint,
but I wouldn't serve it to my dinner guests.

34
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,075
Forget about Mountain Brook.

35
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,201
My dinner date wouldn't
know the difference anyway.

36
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,329
How about a nice...

37
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,455
Beaujolais?

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,334
I'm sure it would go
very well with your meat.

39
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,087
- How much?
- 3.50, plus tax.

40
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,257
All right. I'll take it on your say-so.

41
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,843
Thank you.

42
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:03,558
Now, you be sure to let me know
if you're not completely satisfied.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,018
With wine, you mean?

44
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,522
Bland, did you refuse to sell that customer
a bottle of Mountain Brook?

45
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,231
I certainly did. It's undrinkable.

46
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,235
I'm not interested in your opinion,
Mr. Gourmet.

47
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,530
If a customer wants a brand of wine
that we carry, that's what he gets.

48
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,866
Mr. Cray, I tried a bottle of Mountain Brook.
It made me sick.

49
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,908
Well, it makes me three times as sick...

50
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,745
if I get stuck with those 10 cases
we got piled up downstairs.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,706
- I think this man -
- And another thing.

52
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,209
Who told you to order a case
of Château Lafite Rothschild?

53
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,420
This stuff goes for $400 a bottle.

54
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,548
We don't have customers
for that kind of item!

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,384
- You got your head up your ass?
- Mr. Cray, I think...

56
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:42,221
Excuse me. One of you gentlemen mind giving
me the money out of that cash register?

57
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,599
- What?
- I said give me the money out of the register, sucker.

58
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,308
And make it fast!

59
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:51,938
Mr. Cray, you killed him.

60
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,274
Yeah.

61
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,902
Now how about that Château Lafite?

62
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,403
Dr. Benihana.

63
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,823
Dr. Benihana,
you're wanted in Neurosurgery.

64
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,074
Dr. Benihana.

65
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,368
Dr. Benihana,
you're wanted in Neurosurgery.

66
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,955
What's this garbage?

67
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,125
Liver puree, asparagus salad
and mixed fruit mash.

68
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,668
Make a new man of you.

69
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,086
- Christ.
- Hey, Mary.

70
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,798
Paul called. He's leaving the liquor store early.
Said he'd pick you up after work.

71
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,800
- Okay. Thanks, Sheila.
- Paul?

72
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,804
Isn't that the dumpy dude
who came by for you a couple days ago?

73
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,807
Boy, he seems like a giant hard-off.

74
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,769
He happens to be my husband.

75
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,771
Baby, you got a problem.

76
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,105
And we could solve it so easily.

77
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,107
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

78
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,152
Baby, with a shape like yours,
that's like wasting a natural resource.

79
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,697
- Open your mouth.
- If I do, will you open your legs?

80
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,699
I might do something for you.

81
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,286
If you would do something for me.

82
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,870
Eat that.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,682
Dewey.

84
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,475
How would you like to unblock Golden Boy?

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,185
Love to.

86
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,273
Yuck!

87
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,028
- Okay, I'm ready.
- I can see you are.

88
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,615
I'll bet you thought
I was gonna run out on you.

89
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,575
No. You know
a good thing when you see it.

90
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,872
Hey, Mary, they want you
down in the kitchen.

91
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,876
- I was just about to give Mr. Baker his high colonic.
- What?

92
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,879
- Don't worry. I'll do it for you.
- Oh, Dewey, would you?

93
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,216
But try not to tear anything
like you did last time. Bye.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,218
- Hey.
- Don't worry. She's just kidding.

95
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,179
Actually, enemas are my specialty.

96
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,147
What a luxury to be picked up.
How was your day?

97
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,859
- Not great.
- What's wrong?

98
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,860
I have a little headache.

99
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,865
Oh. I hope it goes away when James comes.

100
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,574
That's all right.

101
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,868
We're having
chicken cacciatore tonight.

102
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:14,039
I hope this place that James found
is gonna be as good as it sounds.

103
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,043
You know, I was thinking about
what we should name it.

104
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,879
I know that you love Chez Bland,
and I do too, but...

105
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,883
well, what if we just called it
Paul and Mary's Country Kitchen?

106
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,094
So I have to take her to these parties
and watch her get laid.

107
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,805
- Oh, God. Wives are the pits.
- Tell me about it.

108
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,935
- So, are you two going to the party?
- We live here.

109
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,937
Too bad.

110
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,021
- Excuse us.
- Oh?

111
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,691
- Hey, you guys, this is the floor.
- All right!

112
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,737
Hey, come down to 234. We'll get it on.

113
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,740
- You two live in the building. You must swing, right?
- Wrong!

114
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,286
- Good night.
- Well, you don't, but I'll bet anything she does.

115
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,921
This building is beginning to
attract some real scum.

116
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,715
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

117
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,932
$175 a month rent increase?
How are we gonna pay that?

118
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,435
Now, don't worry, honey. We can live on
our InstaCash card for a month or two.

119
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,938
Aren't you forgetting something?
It was canceled last month for nonpayment.

120
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,818
Oh. Well, we still have our jobs.

121
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,319
Oh, no, Paul.

122
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,572
I told him not to buy that cheap wine.

123
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,075
Bad wine at a bargain price is no bargain.
But what does he care?

124
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,370
It's not your fault.

125
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,331
We just weren't meant to work
in shops or hospitals.

126
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,334
All those bills and no credit.
What are we gonna...

127
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,713
Mary, why don't we sell your mother's
collection of fabulous '50s furniture?

128
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,593
Oh, no, Paul. You know Mama
only loaned it to us until she dies.

129
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:35,346
Well, there's that money we set aside
for the down payment on the restaurant.

130
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,683
- But that's not gonna keep us for very long.
- You'll get another job.

131
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,896
I could get a raise.
We'll get by somehow.

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,190
James!

133
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:48,193
- What am I gonna say to him?
- Don't say anything to him.

134
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,947
Stall him. I just don't want that
restaurant to slip through our fingers.

135
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,576
- James -
- How you doin', pal? Am I early or what?

136
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,579
- Well, the early bird gets the pussy. Am I right?
- Pussy? Now, come on...

137
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:03,042
- Jesus, she looks like a party all to herself.
- Now come on. Get out of here!

138
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,543
Mister, you'd better get out of here.

139
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,547
If you're not screwing her, somebody's
gonna screw her. Might as well be me, man.

140
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,882
I'll screw you later, sweetheart.
Hey, babe, hey...

141
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,177
Shouldn't have done that.

142
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,475
- Oh, my God!
- He's gonna do it again. Quick! Get him in the bathroom.

143
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,602
- Come on.
- I'm s - I'm sorry.

144
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,105
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

145
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,941
No, no.

146
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,943
Some things are private, man.

147
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,619
Well, we've got to spray the room
with something - the smell.

148
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:42,121
I just don't know why
they let swingers in the building.

149
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,332
Because they're so transient,
that's why.

150
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,045
They're always pairing up and switching off
and moving in and moving out...

151
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,048
and the landlords
get to raise the rent every 10 minutes.

152
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:53,049
"Sexual liberation."

153
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,052
Just look what it's brought us.

154
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:59,764
That is exactly the sort of person we
should refuse to serve in our restaurant.

155
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,605
Hello?

156
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,440
What article?

157
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,276
Oh. Bon Appétit. Yeah, that's me.

158
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,239
Yes, I have a few bottles of that.
1948, as a matter of fact.

159
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,991
Oh, no, I don't think
I'd be interested, no.

160
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,451
Well, all right.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Peck.

161
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,705
If I do I'll give you a call.
Okay?

162
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,789
Thank you. Good-bye.

163
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,084
Who was that?

164
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,503
Some wine collector from New York
staying at the Wilton.

165
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:33,506
Wanted to buy some of my Château Lafite.
Fat chance.

166
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,509
That reminds me though -
What are we drinking tonight?

167
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,513
James is from the Valley.
He probably likes Chablis.

168
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,514
James! I forgot all about James.

169
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,060
- Paul, we can't have that guy here if James comes.
- Hello.

170
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,773
Hello? Can you hear me?

171
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,275
Maybe he's asleep.

172
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,860
Hello?

173
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,572
Oh, my God.

174
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,325
Hey, come on. Wake up.

175
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,327
You've got to go now. Come on. Wake up.

176
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,330
Mary, he doesn't seem to be breathing.

177
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,583
- Do you think he drowned in the toilet?
- Oh! Well, he's not breathing.

178
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,836
What do you think?

179
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,837
- He's dead!
- Oh, great!

180
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,340
What do we do now?

181
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,342
- I don't know! Call the police?
- Well, call the police!

182
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,802
Call the police!
Use the emergency number!

183
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,389
I hope they hurry.

184
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,850
Hello. Officer, is this the police?

185
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,853
Yes, wh-who do I speak to
to report a murder?

186
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:31,689
Not a murder! An accidental death!

187
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,525
Officer, I'm sorry.
An accidental death.

188
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,528
Guess what.

189
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,907
No, I think you have the wrong number.

190
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:44,620
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Help him find his party.

191
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,954
Come on.

192
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,623
Good luck.

193
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,215
Twice?

194
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,216
Welcome to paradise.

195
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,220
- I've got to go.
- Oh, come on. What's your hurry?

196
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,805
Look at this place.
It's like a free candy store.

197
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,057
And you can eat
any piece you can find.

198
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,061
- NNo, thank you. I've really got to go now. My wife...
- Your wife?

199
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:11,562
Hey, come on.
How pussy-whipped can you get?

200
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,191
Look around. Look at her!
She's got eyes for you. She digs you.

201
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,733
Really! Roger!

202
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,402
She's your type too.

203
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,320
- I've seen it many times before.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,572
But it's not the same one.

205
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,201
Look at what he's stirring his drink with!

206
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,576
How gross!

207
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,747
I really have to go.
We're having a friend for dinner.

208
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,917
- If I don't get back -
- Oh, why are you so uptight?

209
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,629
Come on, you're just trying to prevent
yourself from having a good time...

210
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:39,591
from gettin' laid, from gettin' free.

211
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,969
Right. G-good night.

212
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,846
Hey.

213
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,269
You look like you need discipline, slave.

214
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,273
I have to go. Really.
We're having a friend to dinner.

215
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,650
Lick my boot, pig!

216
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,572
Paul? James's office called.

217
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,741
- He'll be here in 15 minutes.
- He...

218
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,412
- Hello, baby.
- Where's Paul?

219
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:12,206
He's gettin' it on with the Marquise de
Sade, so I thought I'd get it on with you.

220
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,917
- What do you say?
- No, thank you.

221
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,918
"No, thank you"?
Is that all you're gonna say?

222
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,130
You're not even gonna help my ego by telling
me you got some weird pussy disease?

223
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,716
- You get out of here.
- Come on, honey!

224
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,719
Come on. Listen, don't be that way.

225
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,846
Look, underneath these expensive clothes
there's a real, lonely human being.

226
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,641
So come on!
Be nice to me! Be nice to me!

227
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,476
No!

228
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,983
No! Get off me!

229
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,402
Help! Paul! Help!

230
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,487
Help! Paul!

231
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,780
Help me! No! No!

232
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,533
Get him off me, Paul!

233
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,166
Paul!

234
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,168
Paul! Stop it! You'll kill him!

235
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,504
You killed him!

236
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,007
- What?
- He's dead. He's really dead.

237
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,092
Oh, shit. That's all I need.

238
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,096
What are we gonna do now?
We can't call the police this time.

239
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,932
I don't know what we're gonna do.

240
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,600
Maybe we could take him out into the
hallway by the swingers' apartment...

241
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,977
and they'll think
that he fell down accidentally.

242
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:19,691
Mary, look at this. This guy is a junior
officer at the Bank of San Fernando.

243
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,193
He must have $600 here.

244
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,529
"Ed Folsley, Jr., Credit Card Division."

245
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,533
Do you suppose he's the one
that canceled our credit card?

246
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,825
James!

247
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,454
- What are we gonna say?
- Take the money and put that back where you found it.

248
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,373
But, Mary, what if they
go through the wallet?

249
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,543
What if the police go through the wallet
and find the money missing?

250
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,710
You leave a little bit of the money,
and they don't mind!

251
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,713
- I don't want to leave any of the money!
- Paul!

252
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,506
Mary, this guy threw up on our carpet.

253
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,217
He canceled our InstaCash card.
He owes us at least $600!

254
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,720
- Mary!
- Just a minute!

255
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,723
$600, Mary. Think of it. 600. That could buy a
lot of things. I'm not gonna put that back.

256
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,562
Okay, don't put the money back. Just go out there
and make sure James does not come in here.

257
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,063
- What am I gonna say to James?
- Give him a drink. Make small talk.

258
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,317
- I can't make small talk.
- You can. Now get out there and be calm.

259
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,324
Just talk to James
and don't let him come in.

260
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,083
Oh. Paul, Hi. Door was open.
I just came right in.

261
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,711
Are you and Mary having
a little argument?

262
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,756
'Cause I heard some noise in the kitchen.
I thought perhaps you...

263
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,759
No. She's just finishing dinner.

264
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,595
It'll be ready in a minute.

265
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,929
I was helping her pound the veal.

266
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,182
Veal? Veal's my favorite food.

267
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,227
But it's so expensive.
You shouldn't have gone to the trouble.

268
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,105
Oh, well, actually
the veal is for tomorrow night.

269
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,899
- We're having chicken.
- Oh.

270
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,027
Okay.

271
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,862
- Would you like a drink? I know I would.
- Yeah.

272
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,615
What can I get you?

273
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,158
Whiskey would be fine.

274
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,161
Whiskey...

275
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,078
would be fine.

276
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,458
Whiskey... would be fine.

277
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,548
He wants some whiskey.

278
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,384
Mary, we're both
going to end up in prison.

279
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,052
No, we're not.

280
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,388
We are going to end up in the country
with our own nice little restaurant.

281
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,975
None of this ever happened.

282
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,311
Now, you take this drink to James...

283
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,899
and dinner will be ready in five minutes.

284
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,485
Mary, I just killed a man.

285
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,613
He was a man, honey.

286
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,240
Now he's just a bag of garbage.

287
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,202
I can't imagine anything more perfect.

288
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,580
- What's the down payment?
- 20,000.

289
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,831
- In two weeks?
- Well, it's a great place.

290
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,668
It's gonna go pretty quick.

291
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,378
It's gonna get a taker.
I just hope it's you.

292
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,091
Well, look, I hate to eat and run...

293
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,513
but got a little homework
to catch up on at home, so...

294
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,014
- Let me know about the place as soon as you can.
- We will.

295
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,018
- You'll be hearing from us in a couple of days.
- Oh, good. Okay. Bye.

296
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,644
- Good night, James.
- Thanks for dinner.

297
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,897
- You're welcome.
- Good night. Bye.

298
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,857
Where are we gonna get $20,000?

299
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,277
Come on.
Help me take out the garbage.

300
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:33,551
I was thinking about going to
the bank tomorrow for a loan.

301
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,725
- What do you think?
- I guess it took him.

302
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,728
- No, I mean about the bank and the loan.
- What loan?

303
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,397
I was thinking about going to
the bank and getting a loan.

304
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:52,153
Here. No bank
is gonna loan us any $20,000.

305
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,530
No, I know that.

306
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,534
But a bank might loan us 10,000.

307
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:00,537
And then we could sell
some of your wine collection.

308
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,123
- Sell some of my wine collection?
- Why not?

309
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,918
Mary, you know I've been
saving that wine for our restaurant.

310
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,254
But, honey, if we don't do something
there's not gonna be any restaurant.

311
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:11,673
Yeah.

312
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,259
What if you just sold a few
of the most expensive bottles?

313
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,929
A few? Like four?

314
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,848
- How about eight?
- Eight?

315
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,975
Well, okay. Six.

316
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,060
- Six?
- How much would that bring us?

317
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,813
Oh.

318
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,899
Six would bring us, oh, I don't know...

319
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,318
about 500 a bottle.

320
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,988
Oh, that's $3,000.

321
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:38,157
Paul, that would be such a help.

322
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,618
Yeah. 3,000.

323
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,537
Okay.

324
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,790
Paul and Mary Bland...

325
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,250
announce the opening
of their new restaurant.

326
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,463
Mary, if we call it the Country Kitchen...

327
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,467
can the specialty still be
the Bland Enchilada?

328
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,885
I hope so. It's the best thing I do.

329
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,725
Have to find the money
for the restaurant first.

330
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,227
Isn't this man from New York rich?

331
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,938
Well, he's staying at the Beverly Wilton.
He can't be broke.

332
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,483
Well, if he buys the wine...

333
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,444
and I get the loan from the bank...

334
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,030
perhaps maybe we can swing this.

335
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,120
- Paul?
- Yeah.

336
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,996
Where's my brush?

337
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,166
Oh, it's in the bureau, honey.

338
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,009
- Paul?
- Yeah?

339
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,596
- What's this?
- What's what?

340
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,516
This card. Doris the Dominatrix?

341
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,853
Discipline mild or severe,
as you require.

342
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,690
- Call for an appointment.
- Oh, that.

343
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,692
She's some madwoman
who attacks people with a whip.

344
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,696
- She was at that swingers party.
- She gave you a card?

345
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,697
She gave everybody her card.

346
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,407
That's disgusting.

347
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,869
Apparently a lot of swingers
enjoy that sort of thing.

348
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,080
I don't mind a little hugging and kissing.

349
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,625
But that...

350
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,179
Mary.

351
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,390
What do you think makes them
go for that weird stuff?

352
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:29,184
- Are they crazy?
- They're sick.

353
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,895
This world is overflowing...

354
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,065
with millions of sexual freaks.

355
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,567
We're so lucky to have found each other.

356
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,071
I know. Good night, dear.

357
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,531
Sweet dreams.

358
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,458
So how long will you be gone?

359
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,293
I don't know.
As long as it takes to apply for a loan.

360
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:57,923
You'll probably get it.
That dress sure shows off your collateral.

361
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,758
Think so?

362
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,759
Thanks for covering for me, Sheila.

363
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,596
Clean-up crew,
you are needed in Intensive Care.

364
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,599
That was pretty nasty,
what you let that creep do to me yesterday.

365
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,600
Well, whatever it was,
it must have worked.

366
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,435
Yeah. They're letting me out.

367
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,355
Congratulations. Good-bye.

368
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,774
Not so fast.

369
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,108
Why don't you let me
buy you a drink or somethin'?

370
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,528
Forget it. Oh!

371
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,157
Oh. What are you doing? I have an
appointment. I'm gonna be late now.

372
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,368
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

373
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,539
Is this you?

374
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,375
- Doris the Dominatrix?
- That's right, buster.

375
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,004
I'm way out of your league, so stay away
from me or I'll hit you with my whip.

376
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,131
I thought you were
a lot more hip than you let on.

377
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,511
How 'bout telling me where she lives.

378
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,932
Oh, Mr. Baker, that's against regulations.

379
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,023
Un moment!

380
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,488
Mr. Bland.
How are you? I'm John Peck.

381
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,992
- How do you do?
- You brought them with. Good, good.

382
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,995
Why don't we put the little beauties down
here on the coffee table.

383
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,204
Yes, excellent.

384
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:15,000
A lovely year. Lovely.

385
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,585
Are you hungry?
I was about to go to the restaurant.

386
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,505
We can leave these here.
No one will trouble them, I'm sure.

387
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:24,384
I'll buy you a little déjeuner and we can
haggle about price over the steak tartare.

388
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,846
It's not Jour Cinq, but I'm sure you'll
find the cuisine here quite palatable.

389
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,847
I'm often amazed in my travels...

390
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,891
Oh, I only want to sell six.

391
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:36,062
Six? Is that all?
Oh, well, that's too bad.

392
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,356
Well, I suppose one takes
what one can get in this life, eh?

393
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,276
Would you excuse me, please?

394
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,110
I have to cash some traveler's checks.

395
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,084
Oh.

396
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,220
Thank you.

397
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,932
Mrs. Bland.
Nice to see you. Please sit down.

398
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,061
I have your loan application right here.

399
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:21,774
Let's see. You and Mr. Bland wish to
purchase a restaurant out in Valencia.

400
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,901
Yes, that's right.

401
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,738
Have you or your husband
ever been in the rest...

402
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:30,657
No, but I've been
a nutritionist at General Parker...

403
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,787
and my husband's been a wine merchant
for several years now.

404
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,040
Well, looking at you, Mrs. Bland...

405
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,961
I have no doubt in my mind that you would be
a success at anything you put your hand to.

406
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,964
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Leech.

407
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,385
I would relish the possibility of
becoming one of your clientele.

408
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,890
Both my husband and I would really
like you to come to our restaurant...

409
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,641
if we get it.

410
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,144
It was actually more your hospitality...

411
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,313
that I was thinking about, Mrs. Bland.

412
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:04,108
Your enthusiasm is very encouraging,
Mr. Leech.

413
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,818
Thank you, Mrs. Bland.

414
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,072
I'm feeling quite encouraged myself.

415
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,081
You through with this?

416
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,708
- Yes, I -
- Good. I'll go bury it.

417
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,347
Mr. Peck?

418
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:41,937
Mrs. Bland, every weekend I give a party for
some of my more sexually liberated friends.

419
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:45,232
Many of them are bank customers
like yourself.

420
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,987
Could you come next weekend?
You can bring your husband, if you want to.

421
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,738
Oh, that's nice, but it's getting late...

422
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,243
and I do have to get back to the hospital,
so if you would just...

423
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,744
I'd like to help you in every way I can,
Mrs. Bland...

424
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,914
but I have to be sure that you're going to
comply with all of the bank's wishes.

425
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,334
$10,000 is a great deal of money.

426
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,586
Mr. Leech, I'm sure the bank
has nothing to worry about.

427
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,380
It's gonna get everything
that's coming to it.

428
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:10,758
- It's just that the bank wants to see what it's getting into.
- Oh, Mr. Leech! Please!

429
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,262
If I could just sort of poke around
in your safety deposit box...

430
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,265
Stop it, you filthy pervert!
You're like everybody else!

431
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:20,518
- Mr. Leech!
- Are you all right, Mr. Leech?

432
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,730
I rejected this woman's loan application
on grounds of insufficient credit.

433
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,192
In desperation she made certain advances
to me, which I of course repulsed.

434
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,235
- You liar!
- Get her out of here, Thomas!

435
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,364
- Never mind about the police. She's just upset.
- Liar! Pervert! Hypocrite!

436
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,201
Rapist! Psycho! You - You swinger, you!

437
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,870
You're letting that woman go?

438
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:45,209
Gosh, Mr. Leech, you're such a good man.

439
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,420
Thank you, Miss Adams.

440
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:51,465
Have I told you about the party
I'm giving this weekend?

441
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,302
- Paul?
- Yeah?

442
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,387
- He didn't buy -
- Buy?

443
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,557
He stole all six bottles.

444
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,893
- Did you get the loan?
- No.

445
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,811
The creep tried to put the make on me.

446
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,481
People are pigs.
How do they get away with it?

447
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,902
Why should they live so well when
good people like you and me get shafted?

448
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:16,157
I don't know. The next person who puts his
hands on me is gonna get shafted right back.

449
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,868
Mary, honey.

450
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,079
- What?
- My back hurts.

451
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,331
Would you walk on it for me?

452
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:26,416
Sure.

453
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,800
- Hiya, Doris!
- What are you doing here? Get out!

454
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,261
Don't panic. I didn't blow your cover
back at the hospital.

455
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,515
- Mary, who is this guy?
- Nobody. He's a patient from the hospital.

456
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,725
Nobody? I got money.
You want big bucks? I got 'em.

457
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,520
I don't mind paying cash for gash,
as long as it's class.

458
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,565
What the hell do you think you're doing?

459
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,567
- I didn't know you knew I was into rape fantasies.
- Get off her! Are you crazy?

460
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,113
I told you, man, I can't wait.
Now listen, buddy.

461
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,157
Don't worry about it. You can have her back
just as soon as I'm finished.

462
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,785
Dynamite! Oh!

463
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,288
- No!
- Yeah, yeah!

464
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,165
Charge!

465
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,251
Paul!

466
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,384
- Paul! Paul!
- Now, there's a nasty bitch!

467
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,513
You're gonna get so hot, you're gonna
burn a hole right through the couch.

468
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,889
- Get off me!
- Jesus!

469
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,989
Are you all right?

470
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,158
Goddamn swinger.

471
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:43,577
Dead.

472
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,163
Good.

473
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:49,625
Paul, there is nearly $500 here.

474
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,627
These swinger types
always seem to have money.

475
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,173
Well, now it's ours.
You want his watch?

476
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,758
Thanks.

477
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,887
Do you realize that we have made
almost $1,000 in two days, tax free?

478
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,181
Just by killing people.

479
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,310
Horrible, sex-crazed maniacs
that nobody in the world would miss.

480
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:11,521
I wonder how much we could make
if we really put our minds to it.

481
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,023
What do you mean?

482
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,359
This city is full of rich perverts.

483
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,819
If somehow we could get them
to come to the apartment...

484
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,365
But, Mary, why would they?
We'd have to lure them with...

485
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,866
Sex.

486
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,827
But... you wouldn't really have to...

487
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:29,499
- I mean, you wouldn't actually do anything.
- Of course not.

488
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,377
The minute they try anything dirty,
you pop them in the head...

489
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,628
and get rid of them,
like you did with this guy.

490
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,297
Mary, how would we contact them?

491
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,883
We don't know anything
about this swinger business.

492
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,052
Ask someone who does.

493
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,389
All of them read this?

494
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,475
- Isn't there something a little more -
- Classier?

495
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,854
Nope. This paper covers the field
from the richest to the poorest.

496
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,356
If they're kinky,
they read the Hollywood Press.

497
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,527
Come on, honey! You like this!

498
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,778
You know, if you steam fresh vegetables...

499
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,780
and then puree them in a blender...

500
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,782
it would be better for your baby.

501
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:07,202
- Mary's a nutritionist.
- No kidding. Does that pay well?

502
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,622
About 450 after taxes.

503
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:12,625
Oh, honey, you'll make
a hell of a lot more in my racket.

504
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,253
Are you gonna work with her?

505
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,256
Why not? You get the bi
and gay trade that way.

506
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,174
And those people have
a lot of money, believe me.

507
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,512
- I don't think -
- I understand.

508
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,515
Everybody's gotta make up his own mind
about where to draw the line.

509
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:30,143
I personally draw the line
at golden showers.

510
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,644
Golden showers?

511
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,606
- Listen. Did you ever do any acting?
- I did some in high school.

512
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,733
Well, that's all it is, is acting.

513
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,611
Lick my sneakers, you little worm!

514
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,655
See what I mean? It's easy!

515
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,992
Lick my sneaker, you little worm.

516
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,119
See? You're a natural.

517
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:53,331
That's my laundry. If I don't get it into
the dryer quickly, it'll wrinkle bad.

518
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,084
Was there anything else
you wanted to ask about?

519
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,087
- No, I think we've just about covered it.
- There's nothing to it.

520
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,089
Just remember to get the money up front.

521
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,134
And whatever they want to do,
stop if it draws blood.

522
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,973
I'll bet we could
get started on this for about $400.

523
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,974
We have to take out an ad first.

524
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:14,519
- Yeah. And I have to rent a post office box someplace.
- Paul, we have a ticket!

525
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:18,441
No, it's just a flyer.

526
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,526
Wait, wait. What is it?

527
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,821
Some lock service that
puts in new locks cheap.

528
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,656
12.95.

529
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:31,162
When Mrs. Berkowitz was robbed,
it cost her $35 to put new locks in.

530
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,873
12.95 isn't a bad price.

531
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,167
Raoul's Lock and Key Service.

532
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,461
Raoul. Probably just got in
from Guadalajara.

533
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,632
- I think it's a good idea.
- What's a good idea?

534
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,341
Putting in new locks.

535
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,428
We don't want people wandering in
when we're bopping perverts.

536
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,350
Look, Mary. Our ad's out.

537
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,352
We do anything.

538
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,021
Well, that's certainly
laying it on the line.

539
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:01,400
Whatever your sex fantasies,
from the ordinary to the most bizarre...

540
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,693
Carla and Nancy will accommodate you.

541
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,196
- Cute names.
- Well, what do you think?

542
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,199
Does that answer your question?

543
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,201
All that in the box today?

544
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,203
Our first clients.

545
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,038
You go first.

546
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,044
Dear Mommy...

547
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,590
Here is an indecent picture of me.

548
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,176
As you can see,
I have been a very bad boy...

549
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,721
and I hope you will
discipline me very severely.

550
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,516
Yours, Bobby R.

551
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,562
Well, he left a phone number.

552
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,312
Well, there's a phone.

553
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,071
Hello. Is this Bobby R?

554
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,742
Well, this is your mother calling.
Cruel Carla.

555
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,744
Were you expecting my call?

556
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,913
Insult him. Call him names.

557
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:01,085
Yes, Bobby, you little worm.
I saw what you did...

558
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,922
and I'm going to teach you a lesson
that you're never gonna forget.

559
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:07,466
But it's gonna cost you a lot.
How much?

560
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,634
It's... it's gonna cost...

561
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,136
$300.

562
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,140
It's gonna cost you $300.

563
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,807
Yes.

564
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,852
He said yes!

565
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,437
Address?

566
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:25,775
All right, I want you to come
to 525 Oxford Lane at 7:00.

567
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,112
And bring cash, you little jerk!

568
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:30,363
No checks and no credit cards!

569
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,533
Thank you.

570
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,578
Well...

571
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,663
- How'd I do?
- He's coming, isn't he?

572
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,124
- Yeah.
- Let's call another one.

573
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,125
I think we can do two a night.
Don't you?

574
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,295
- How about this guy for 9:00?
- Ecch!

575
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:47,130
Yeah, but he's got
a Beverly Hills address.

576
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:49,799
See if he'll go 350.

577
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,801
- Who could that be?
- I don't know.

578
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,803
Just a minute! Who is it?

579
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,014
- Lock service!
- Lock service?

580
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,810
Hello. Lock service.
You the lady of the house?

581
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,812
Yes. This is my husband here.

582
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,522
- Hello.
- Hello.

583
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,525
Okay, okay, let's take a look around here.

584
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,863
- You ain't got no back door?
- No. Why should that make a difference?

585
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,865
- This is the main point of entry.
- What other point would there be?

586
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,369
Someplace you would never think of,
like the windows.

587
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,828
- The windows?
- Oh, yeah. These thieves are very slick.

588
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,581
But we're on the 5th floor.
There's no fire escape.

589
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,084
- You think that'll stop them?
- Well, I just don't see how anybody could...

590
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,086
Look, I don't want to argue with you.

591
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,338
- Oh, yeah, it's a good thing you called me.
- Why?

592
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,508
'Cause any thief with half a brain
could open this lock...

593
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,218
with a plastic card or a flexible ruler.

594
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,802
- How?
- See?

595
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,512
- Oh, good heavens.
- And look.

596
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,516
- There's only four screws holding it in place.
- He's right.

597
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,517
One good kick and it would be gone.

598
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,563
- I could put in a new one like I advertised for $20.
- It said 12.95 in your flyer.

599
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,773
- That was the old price.
- The old price?

600
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,650
- Everything's going up.
- Well, yeah, but...

601
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:51,152
- Hey, it's a nice place you got here.
- Well, thank you.

602
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:54,155
It would be a crime to let some punk
burglar break in and take all of your...

603
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,783
You keep anything of value around here?

604
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,785
- No, nothing.
- Well, Paul, that's not true.

605
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:01,788
What about your wine collection?
My husband collects very good wine.

606
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,790
Oh, yeah? Is that worth much?

607
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,210
- Some of the bottles are worth $500.
- Mary!

608
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,045
Oh, yeah?

609
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,381
- Well, hey, you don't wanna take a chance with that.
- No.

610
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,384
Besides, if anybody breaks through
one of my special locks...

611
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:17,637
I guarantee not only to replace the lock but
also the value of anything that is stolen.

612
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,974
- How often does that happen?
- Never.

613
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:23,184
Listen, what about these windows?
Are these really a problem?

614
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,730
In most cases no.
Of course, there's always a chance.

615
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,233
How much would it cost
to have the windows fixed too?

616
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,235
- $800.
- Eight hun - What?

617
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:33,237
Well, you just can't put on locks.

618
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,240
You gotta put up bars, and you gotta wire
the windows to the central alarm system...

619
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,576
that activates the telephone signal
to the police.

620
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,162
Forget it.

621
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,997
Mr...

622
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,791
- Call me Raoul.
- M-Mr. Raoul.

623
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,336
Are you at all familiar with handcuffs?

624
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,713
Once or twice. Why?

625
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:55,842
Well, how much would it cost
to put sets of handcuffs in the walls?

626
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,845
You wanna put handcuffs in your wall?

627
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,680
Yeah. Just as a decorative motif.

628
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,433
- Well, never mind. When can you do the locks?
- Hey, right now.

629
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:08,146
Trust me. You and your husband ain't gonna
spend another insecure night in this place.

630
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,447
Mr. Rabbit said,
"Do you promise not to eat me?"

631
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,492
And Mrs. Fox said, "Give me $500."

632
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:25,121
I've been very bad, haven't I, Mommy?

633
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,375
Are you gonna teach me a good lesson?
Are you gonna spank me?

634
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,753
Yes, you have been bad, Bobby,
and I am gonna spank you.

635
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,297
No, hard.

636
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,049
So hard you won't be able
to sit down! Ever!

637
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,221
Like hell you will.
Screw you, Mommy, you hostile bitch.

638
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,018
Just a minute. I'll be back.

639
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,356
What is taking you so long?

640
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,483
Can't you get him to do something to you?
Hit you? Anything!

641
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,821
- I can't hit him if he doesn't make me angry.
- Honestly, Paul.

642
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,949
I made a mess!

643
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,077
Look, Bobby, if you want Mommy
to discipline you...

644
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,413
you're going to have to do
what Mommy likes.

645
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,999
Oh, yes, Bobby. Mommy likes that.

646
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,461
Oh! Don't bite me there, Bobby!
Oh, Bobby, please, no!

647
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:17,842
Bobby! Stop, stop! I can't stand it!
Please! You're hurting me!

648
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,677
Bobby, don't bite me there!

649
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,179
No! Please!

650
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:26,724
Where'd he get you?

651
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:31,020
He didn't get me.
I was pretending to get you out here.

652
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,568
This may turn out to be
harder than we thought.

653
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,570
Very well, Fräulein! I ask you again!

654
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,115
And if I do not get an answer,
you will force me to give you pain.

655
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,826
Where are they hiding?

656
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,329
What? You still have no memory?

657
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,833
Oh, I don't know why it is...

658
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,128
that I feel so merciful today.

659
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,465
Fräulein, perhaps...

660
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,634
it is because you look...

661
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:06,681
so innocent, so respectful of me.

662
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,894
Or perhaps it is because...

663
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,230
I know that the more
you wait for the pain...

664
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,400
the more you will enjoy the pain.

665
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,777
Even now...

666
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,780
these creamy white shoulders...

667
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,199
are aching for the lash.

668
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,369
I will never tell you where they are,
you filthy Nazi pig.

669
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,338
So...

670
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,340
you want to play rough, do you?

671
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,344
I will show you rough.

672
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,016
Oh, what an ordeal.

673
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,393
I thought he would never stop talking.

674
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,855
Nobody can say we don't earn this money.

675
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,943
A check!
I told him not to bring a check!

676
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,528
After this no more actors. Okay?

677
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,529
Why don't you go to bed, honey?

678
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,699
- I'll bag the Nazi and straighten up around here.
- Okay.

679
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,786
I'll see you in a little while.
Good night.

680
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,166
- Paul, where's the money?
- I don't know. Isn't it here?

681
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,169
- Did you take it into the bedroom?
- Of course I...

682
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,088
Somebody's in here.

683
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,173
They're in the kitchen. Come on.

684
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,885
The lock man.

685
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,346
I should have known
it was too cheap to be true. Okay, Raoul...

686
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,432
- If that's your name.
- Give us the money back.

687
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,184
- What money?
- The money you took from the other room. Give it back.

688
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:40,061
Why? Is it yours?

689
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,272
- Of course it's ours.
- Maybe it belongs to that vato in the bag.

690
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,273
- We didn't kill him.
- That was an accident.

691
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,733
And the other one?

692
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,277
- That was another accident -
- That was the strangest thing...

693
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,278
- What happened?
- The gas from the kitchen...

694
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,614
He was hit by lightning...
Paul!

695
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:53,616
You know what I think?
I think you killed these people.

696
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,327
And I don't think you want
the police to know about it.

697
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,538
What if we did kill 'em?
What makes you think we won't kill you?

698
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,458
- Yeah.
- You can try.

699
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,795
- But I'm willing to make a deal -
- We're not giving up any of that money.

700
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:08,382
Why should we give up any of it?
We had to kill two people to get it.

701
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:11,592
- You killed two people for less than a thousand dollars?
- One of them shortchanged us.

702
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,971
That seems like a lot of work
for not so much money.

703
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,972
As a matter of fact, it was easy.

704
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,974
We lured those people here
with an ad in the Hollywood Press...

705
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,810
and then I hit them
over the head with this.

706
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:22,645
- The Hollywood Press?
- That's right. This is Naughty Nancy.

707
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,565
- No!
- And Cruel Carla.

708
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,233
No! I don't believe it.

709
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,319
- You don't believe it?
- Show him the ad.

710
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,987
Come here.

711
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,368
There, on the table.

712
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,458
Oh, man, that's fantastic.

713
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:44,960
You know...

714
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:47,753
I was gonna answer that ad myself.

715
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,757
I gotta hand it to you. You guys got
a very original scam going here.

716
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,759
Well, it was mostly Mary's idea.

717
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,012
Paul's just being modest.

718
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,891
It is so sweet to see such
a loving couple as yourselves.

719
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,184
- Now about this proposition -
- We're not interested.

720
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,518
Cálmate, cabrón.

721
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,896
You want the money?
I'll give you back the money.

722
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,690
All I want is the cadavers.

723
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:08,275
- The what?
- The bodies.

724
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:10,027
What do you want them for?

725
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,154
That's my business.
But I'm gonna split it with you 50-50.

726
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,699
You take the cash,
you give me everything else.

727
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:18,367
We're gonna make a nice profit.
$200, $300 for each of us.

728
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,411
- That's ridiculous. Those -
- It's a deal.

729
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,331
Just think. No more trash compactor.

730
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,875
Mary, how do we know
he won't just go to the police?

731
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:28,878
Yeah, right, pendejo.
I'm a fuckin' professional thief, man.

732
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,256
Well, all right.

733
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,884
We'll give you the two bodies
we have on hand at the moment.

734
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:37,511
You see what you can do with them. Then, in
a few days, if you bring back the money...

735
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,306
we'll have some more for you.

736
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,766
- Now, do we get the cash back?
- But of course.

737
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,244
Well, that was easy.

738
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,913
Maybe for you.

739
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:05,039
Watch out for his sword.

740
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,045
This costume is so hot.

741
00:43:10,128 --> 00:43:12,838
Yeah? Well, for $400
you could be Humpty-Dumpty.

742
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,590
Believe me, I'm not complaining.

743
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,884
Who is it?

744
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,719
It's me, Raoul.

745
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,431
- Did you bring the money?
- Come on. Let me in.

746
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,565
- What is she supposed to be?
- A cartoon mouse.

747
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,277
Man, I hate to see a beautiful woman
degraded like that.

748
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,696
Yeah, well, we don't
choose these fantasies. They do.

749
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,117
Come on.
Help me get this guy in the bag.

750
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,161
Excuse me.

751
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,960
Well, let's have it, Raoul. How much cash did
you get for those two stiffs we advanced?

752
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:51,545
$1,400.

753
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,630
That makes your share $700.

754
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,340
Raoul, that's wonderful.

755
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,802
That ring that one guy had -
That must have been worth quite a lot?

756
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:02,139
Gold-plate and cut glass?
Worth maybe $20, $30.

757
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,807
I could have told you
that ring wasn't worth anything.

758
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:12,273
How much does the King
pay for, like, raw material?

759
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,360
- Fifty cents a pound.
- Fifty cents a pound?

760
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,987
All right, man.

761
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,989
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna bring you,
like, 400 or 500 pounds.

762
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:24,494
Hey, I don't know, man. I don't like to fuck
around with the King. It's my job, you know.

763
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,331
Hey, I don't shit where I eat.

764
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,166
Yeah. I know what you mean.

765
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,544
Okay, listen, man.
I'm gonna take care of you.

766
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,671
You want a 30-inch color TV?
You got it.

767
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,590
But you gotta take this stuff from me.
It's perfect for the King, man.

768
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,887
- It's fresh.
- No, man. Forget the TV. I need wheels.

769
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,347
- Is that all you need is wheels, ese?
- Yeah.

770
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,182
IPues órale!

771
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,351
I'm gonna get you
some fine-looking wheels. All right?

772
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,187
All right!

773
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,648
That hippie guy's not gonna show up.

774
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,735
We've thrown away $70 on this light show.

775
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,528
- Who's the 9:00?
- Some sickie with a Great Dane.

776
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,697
- A Great Dane?
- $500.

777
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,909
Oh. Do we have to kill the dog too?

778
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,869
Probably. It might lead somebody
back here otherwise.

779
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,414
Why don't we give the dog
to Raoul as a present?

780
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,417
Sorry. It was just a thought.

781
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,253
- Are you hungry?
- I'm starving.

782
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,798
Me too. I'm gonna go to the store
and get something.

783
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,342
- Chicken all right?
- Yes, but go to Ralph's. I just like their produce better.

784
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,885
Okay.

785
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:25,304
- Oh, and, Paul -
- Yeah?

786
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,391
Do you think you could buy
another frying pan?

787
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,726
I'm just a little squeamish about cooking
in the one we're using to kill people.

788
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,645
Yeah, sure.

789
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,740
What'd you do, forget your keys?

790
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,994
- Hey, baby. Groovy outfit.
- Oh.

791
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,415
- You're late, so -
- Oh, I can't be late. Time is all relative.

792
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,168
Wait a minute. I'm peaking. I'm peaking.
The music is The Dead.

793
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,546
- The incense, coconut.
- I'm afraid that there's been...

794
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,425
Oh, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.
Fear is a mind trap, baby.

795
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,302
What we fear is the past becoming
the future. What we really have is now.

796
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,304
There's been some mistake,
and so if you...

797
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,974
Oh, I know the mistake.
I see. You want me to cool you out...

798
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,726
- No.
- And make you less uptight.

799
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,938
Okay. I know how to do that. Little Thai stick.
You guys like Thai sticks?

800
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:18,357
No. I don't want any Thai stick, and I don't
want to get cooled out, whatever that means.

801
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,318
I would just like you to leave now and...

802
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,653
Okay. You're bumming me out.
I'm trying to play ball with you here.

803
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,406
I'm trying to play the game. I'm trying your lingo.
I'm trying your jargon.

804
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,576
- But you're making me upti... You think I'm an uncool dude?
- No.

805
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,659
- An unhip daddy?
- No.

806
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,245
Think just 'cause I got
a Ronson lighter...

807
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,872
maybe a couple credit cards,
I'm an uncool dude?

808
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,832
- No.
- Tell you something. I've been to hell and back, bitch.

809
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,126
Yeah. While you were sitting at home watching
Captain Kangaroo and munching on Cocoa Puffs...

810
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,129
- I don't have a TV.
- I was in 'Nam defending your ass?

811
00:46:40,213 --> 00:46:42,507
Oh, but I'm not hip enough for you. No.

812
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:46,177
- I didn't know that you hippie broads wore underwear?
- It's a costume!

813
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,971
- Oh, sure it's a costume.
- Get off me!

814
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:50,681
Oh, look out.
Here comes the duke now!

815
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,726
Get off me!

816
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,884
Hijo.

817
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,177
Look at this.

818
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,222
How much?

819
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,264
A lot, chiquita.

820
00:47:32,974 --> 00:47:34,726
Mucho dinero.

821
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,443
Does that make you feel better?

822
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,323
You feel comfortable now?

823
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,078
Hey, look.

824
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:03,379
- It's Thai stick.
- What is that stuff?

825
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,215
You never had Thai?

826
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:07,259
No. Is it good?

827
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,260
Oh, it's the best.

828
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,721
- Try some. It'll make you feel real good.
- No.

829
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,474
Just inhale it real deep and hold it.

830
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,439
- I can't.
- That's okay. Try it again.

831
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,447
Is it good?

832
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:32,117
It makes me feel funny.

833
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:36,413
- I feel warm.
- Yeah.

834
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,498
Like your blood has fire in it.

835
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,750
I think I should get dressed now.

836
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,961
You should be dressed.

837
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:46,672
Only in the most beautiful furs.

838
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:50,510
The finest silk next to your fine body.

839
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,511
I have to get up.

840
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:56,266
You should have servants
to massage you, pamper you.

841
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,521
A sexy woman like you
should always be relaxed.

842
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,691
Like a beautiful...

843
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,776
Rich...

844
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,403
purring... cat.

845
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,324
The lights. Turn out the lights.

846
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,375
I got kind of carried away, honey. I...

847
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,503
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, it's a good thing he came when he did.

848
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,089
If it wasn't for Raoul,
this creep would have raped me.

849
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,923
This the guy we thought wouldn't show up?

850
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,802
- I had to strangle him with his own beads.
- You did?

851
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,347
Well, thanks.
How much money did he have on him?

852
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:38,349
- $700.
- And here's 300 from the last one.

853
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,979
That's friction from the rug.

854
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,230
It makes an electrical charge.

855
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,822
Well, Paul, I'd say this has been
a pretty profitable evening for you?

856
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,158
- Yeah. Not bad.
- I better be going.

857
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,160
- Yeah.
- I'll see you guys tomorrow night.

858
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,913
- Can you manage him?
- "Vayos" con Dios.

859
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,960
Vayos con Dios?

860
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,961
He's teaching you Spanish now?

861
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,005
That way he can talk to you
behind my back?

862
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,300
Don't be silly, Paul. Everybody knows
what vayos con Dios means.

863
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,596
Yeah. How come there's only $900 here?

864
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,849
I gave 100 to Raoul.
After all, he did kill him.

865
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:24,646
I suppose he earned it. I don't know, Mary.
I just don't trust that guy.

866
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,440
Paul, you act as if we're lovers
or something.

867
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,028
- What time's the next one due?
- 9:00.

868
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,864
Would you knock him off really quickly?
I'm kind of tired.

869
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,534
You're sure you wouldn't rather
have Raoul come back and do it?

870
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,077
There he is. What do I look like?

871
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,788
Great.

872
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:44,708
Bow, wow, wow.

873
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,963
Oh, great. Trigger likes you already.

874
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,593
Attention all male nurses.

875
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,221
- Excuse me.
- Your dance is canceled for this evening.

876
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:01,724
I got an appointment
to see Mrs. Bland, the nurse.

877
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,227
- It's for an examination.
- A physical examination?

878
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,230
Yeah. I think I got T.B. Or somethin'.

879
00:51:07,313 --> 00:51:12,067
You'll find Mrs. Bland down the hall
and to your left, room 145.

880
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,069
Attention all male nurses.

881
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,990
Your dance is canceled for this evening.

882
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,662
Come in.

883
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,916
The nurse at the desk
gave me a funny look when I asked for you.

884
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,085
Never mind her.
Take off your shirt.

885
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,879
What for?

886
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,174
Because I want it to look as though
I'm examining you if anybody comes in.

887
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,217
You want me to take off my pants too?

888
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,721
- Raoul.
- And then maybe you'd like me to take off your pants.

889
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,766
Raoul, I agreed to see you because...

890
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,769
I think that we should discuss
what happened the other night.

891
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,312
Yeah.

892
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,355
That's all I've been thinkin' about
for three days.

893
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,817
It was a mistake. That's all.

894
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,862
I don't want you to think
that it could ever happen again.

895
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:01,117
I'm not about to risk my marriage
for the sake of some low animal attraction.

896
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,454
What risk?
Your husband's never gonna know.

897
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,206
Yes, he will.

898
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,081
We know each other too well.

899
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,835
- He can sense when something's different.
- Maybe you're right.

900
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,505
Maybe we should go to your husband
and tell him everything.

901
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,633
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, I'm crazy!

902
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,635
About you, chiquita.

903
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,054
I don't care about your husband.
I don't care about the money.

904
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:24,097
- I don't care about nothin' but you.
- That's ridiculous.

905
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,643
You don't understand
who you're dealing with.

906
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm a hot-blooded,
emotional, crazy Chicano!

907
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:33,482
I think you're
a calculating little bastard.

908
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,068
Bastard?

909
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:44,493
All right then. I'm gonna go to your
husband, and I'm gonna tell him everything.

910
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,079
And then we'll have to
fight for you man-to-man.

911
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,416
A man in love will do anything,
and I am a man in love.

912
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,961
And I think you're a little bit
in love with me too?

913
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,255
Don't be silly.

914
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,173
That's nonsense.
I'm not in love with you.

915
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:02,177
I was confused that night
because of that cigarette that you gave me.

916
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,639
You'll like it even better
the second time.

917
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,976
If I'm wrong...

918
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,061
I'll never bother you again.

919
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,113
Is it a deal?

920
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:23,324
You'll say nothing to Paul?

921
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:27,036
I promise. Come on, chiquita.

922
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,079
I want to make love to you.

923
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,542
Well, just this once, but...

924
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,544
as long as you turn out the lights.

925
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,630
Any way you like it.
And I know you're gonna like it.

926
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,049
Here.

927
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,469
You remember the way
I taught you to smoke this?

928
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,137
I think so.

929
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,978
Oh, baby, I'm gonna drive you crazy.

930
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:58,817
- Have you seen Mary?
- Not for a half hour or so. Why?

931
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,195
It's past 1:00, and there's a whole ward
that hasn't had its lunch yet.

932
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,240
Hold down the desk for a while.
I'll see if I can scare her up.

933
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,911
Well, make it snappy, 'cause those amputees get
awfully mean if they don't get their grub.

934
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,334
This was very wrong.

935
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,586
You didn't think that a little while ago.

936
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,963
Then you didn't want to stop.

937
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:24,594
Mary, if you've finished your examination,
you're wanted in "B" Ward.

938
00:54:24,677 --> 00:54:28,806
Oh, my God. It's after 1:00.

939
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:33,603
Shush! Someone's gonna hear you.

940
00:54:33,686 --> 00:54:35,188
You know, chiquita?

941
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,565
You and me could
make each other very happy...

942
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,943
and very rich...
if it wasn't for your husband.

943
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,738
It is only because of my husband
that I'm here in the first place.

944
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:48,201
If he excited you the way I do,
you wouldn't even be with me.

945
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:52,079
Paul and I have been together for 10 years.
Our marriage is based on something...

946
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,123
much more important than sex.

947
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,628
- Like what?
- Like friendship and security.

948
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:04,675
There would be more security for both of us if
we split the money two ways instead of three.

949
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,096
- You are crazy.
- What would you do if...

950
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:13,976
just supposing now -
if something were to... happen to Paul?

951
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,688
Would you continue
to do business with me?

952
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,565
Nothing is going to happen to Paul.

953
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,485
No. No, nothing's gonna happen to Paul.

954
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,153
But you never know.

955
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,447
Yeah, baby.

956
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,995
What do you want?

957
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,039
I'd like a vibrator,
please, and a pair of handcuffs.

958
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,710
- Get him out of here. He's not 18.
- Hey, man. Come on. I'm 18.

959
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,920
- Get him out of here!
- Aw, come on. Give me the magazine back.

960
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,672
- Let's go. Out of the store, kid.
- Shit.

961
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:44,464
And a... ring.

962
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,175
And a what?

963
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,512
- A cock ring.
- Oh, a cock ring. What size?

964
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,222
Hey. Did you get the latest
issue of Nuns and Nazis?

965
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:53,807
Tuesday.

966
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:56,893
- What size?
- Medium, I suppose.

967
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,438
- Is it for you?
- Medium will be fine.

968
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,025
Sure. Okay. Your vibrators
start at 10.95 and go up.

969
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:07,070
We've got the Salami,
the Man-O-War and Alien.

970
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,905
Just give me the cheapest one.

971
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,824
Wait a minute.
There's nothing cheap about my store.

972
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,577
You mean inexpensive, don't you?

973
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,704
- Isn't that what you meant?
- Yes.

974
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,998
That's what I thought you meant.
You want a cheap pair of handcuffs too?

975
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,584
Yes.

976
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,711
All right. You're gonna need
some lubricant for this vibrator.

977
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,463
We've got K-Y and Lay-Orgy gel.

978
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,798
Hey, you taste it,
you're gonna buy it, all right?

979
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:32,137
The Lay-Orgy gel comes
in lemon, mint, cherry or trail mix.

980
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,474
- Trail mix?
- I was making a joke.

981
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,226
Just these three items will be fine.

982
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,230
You know, you're probably
gonna need some stay-hard roll-on.

983
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,981
- No, thank you.
- Some titty lube?

984
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,108
- No.
- China Shrink Cream?

985
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:46,402
- No.
- Ben Wa Dancing Egg?

986
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,780
Just these three items will be fine.

987
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,992
Okay, hot rod. It comes to $19.50.

988
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:56,871
But I'm tellin' ya, you're gonna need
a lubricant for this vibrator.

989
00:56:56,954 --> 00:56:59,456
Unless your date's inflatable. Ha!

990
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:05,505
For your information, I am buying this
to use as a novelty cocktail stirrer.

991
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,255
Sure!

992
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,599
Paul, nobody is trying to kill you.

993
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,476
We're the ones who are killing people.

994
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:03,354
Twice he tried to run me down,
the rotten little beaner.

995
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,940
- What rotten little beaner?
- Guess.

996
00:58:06,023 --> 00:58:08,567
Paul, did you actually
see Raoul driving the car?

997
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,987
No, he was wearing
some kind of ski mask or something.

998
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,197
You said it was a Toyota.
Have you ever seen Raoul in a Toyota?

999
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:17,951
Well, maybe he borrowed it. How do I know?
Maybe he stole it. It was definitely him.

1000
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,329
Paul, I think you're jumping to conclusions,
and I don't want to discuss it anymore.

1001
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,708
Now why don't you help me
with these letters?

1002
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,169
What's a basket job?

1003
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,729
Hey, I thought you said 50 cents a pound.

1004
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:53,983
That's for trimmed, man.
For this stuff, you're lucky to get 30.

1005
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,235
Hey, all right.
I should have trimmed it. You're right.

1006
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,571
All right, man.
We got some driving to do. Let's go.

1007
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,327
- Dog food?
- Doggie King brand.

1008
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,788
Oh, well. So what? Who cares?
As long as we get our cut.

1009
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,625
Mary, what if somebody recognizes
a piece of clothing or jewelry?

1010
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,711
- That's not likely.
- What if somebody finds out...

1011
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,297
what the night crew at Doggie King
is feeding into their grinder?

1012
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,298
I am sure that Raoul
knows what he's doing.

1013
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:21,509
I'll say he does. You know where
he's getting most of the money?

1014
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,596
- From the cars.
- Cars?

1015
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,513
The cars. Something we never thought of.

1016
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,892
He takes the car keys
out of those people's pockets...

1017
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:30,936
and then he figures out which of the cars
parked downstairs belong to them...

1018
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,439
and then he sells the cars
for a lot of money...

1019
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,441
a lot more than he's splitting with us.

1020
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,318
I don't believe you.

1021
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,445
Mary, he's making thousands
of dollars from those cars.

1022
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,865
- Nonsense.
- We'll see if it's nonsense when I confront him with it tonight.

1023
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:47,202
Listen to me, Paul. In a couple of weeks
we will have everything we wanted.

1024
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,789
- Until then, what is the point of making trouble?
- I'll tell you what's the point.

1025
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,876
That son of a bitch is making a play for my
wife and trying to kill me. That's the point.

1026
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,879
Oh, my God. My 9:00.

1027
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:01,634
Hello?

1028
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:04,219
Just a minute.

1029
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,262
Just a minute.

1030
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,306
Keep your shirt on.

1031
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,309
Vayos con Dios indeed.

1032
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,061
- Paula?
- I said just a minute.

1033
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,231
Paul, I can't find the pants
to this costume. I'm...

1034
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,981
I'm coming.

1035
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,360
- Oh, Paula!
- Fuck the costume.

1036
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,076
♪ Doggie King ♪

1037
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:31,371

01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,582
Really!

1039
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:38,211

1041

1042
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,263
Well, what a surprise.

1043
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,348
I hope you don't mind
my dropping in like this.

1044
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,641
Of course not.
Please forgive the condition of the house.

1045
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,269
Frank had some old army buddies
in last night, and...

1046
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,688
- Please.
- Well...

1047
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,649
So, how's it going?

1048
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,609
Great. Of course...

1049
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:04,195
It is a mixed bag.
Some of those people that come to us...

1050
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,282
- Pretty gross?
- It's not just that.

1051
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:09,994
Some of them are into fantasies that
require a great deal of acting ability...

1052
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,581
and while Mary has gotten a whole lot
better in the last few weeks...

1053
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:16,500
there's one situation where I'm afraid...

1054
01:03:16,585 --> 01:03:18,376
- You need a pro.
- Exactly.

1055
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,588
Mary doesn't know anything
about this, of course.

1056
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,882
I didn't want to hurt her feelings.
You understand.

1057
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:28,136
Of course.
So, what's the deal? Full costume?

1058
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,221
Yes.

1059
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,057
But not the type you're used to.

1060
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,601
Excuse me.

1061
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,605
Excuse me.

1062
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,360
Do you believe in the sixth sense?

1063
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,488
- I think I gave you over a dollar.
- No, no, no, no.

1064
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,657
The sixth sense.
Some blind people have it. I have it.

1065
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,202
- May I sit down?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

1066
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:01,086
You have been very wicked,
and you are in terrible danger.

1067
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,880
So is everybody who eats here.

1068
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,885
You have been earning money
from an evil undertaking...

1069
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:13,806
and if you keep it up,
you will burn for all eternity in hell.

1070
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,393
Hey, sister. I'm in hell right now.

1071
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,394
That money's gonna help get me out.

1072
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,484
That money is gonna bring
a curse down on you!

1073
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:28,780
You'll have more bad luck
than you ever dreamed possible!

1074
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,492
Not religious?

1075
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:35,246
Doris, when we get through with him, he'll be
happy to clean the latrines at a leper colony.

1076
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,456
Unleash the border patrol.

1077
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,713
Mr. Raoul Mendoza?

1078
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,632
Maybe.

1079
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,387
I'm with the immigration Department.
May I see your green card, please?

1080
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,389
I'll see you later, man.

1081
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,057
Green card? What are you talking about?
I ain't no wetback.

1082
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:58,851
According to our information...

1083
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:01,063
your birth certificate is a forgery.

1084
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:05,233
- You got the wrong Mendoza, baby.
- Sure, all you vatos say that.

1085
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,736
Hey, you don't scare me any.
This is all talk.

1086
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,905
Oh, yeah? Well, you better get
while the getting's good.

1087
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,159
This time tomorrow I'm gonna have
enough on you to drop-kick your ass...

1088
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,161
back over the Rio Grande.

1089
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,998
Hasta la vista, cholo.

1090
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:23,126
Nervous and flustered, eh? But you don't see
him jumping on the next plane for Mexico City?

1091
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,253
Okay, we better escalate to plan "C."

1092
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,176
- Who is it?
- Health inspector.

1093
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,976
Hi. Mr. Raoul Mendoza?

1094
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,438
¿Cómo está usted?

1095
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:45,273
I'm Sally Cummings
from the L.A. Health Department...

1096
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,446
and I've been sent here by the city to warn
everyone on your socioeconomic level...

1097
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,824
about an epidemic of a new kind
of venereal disease.

1098
01:05:53,907 --> 01:05:56,201
Hey, lady.
Don't worry about me. I'm clean.

1099
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,287
Of course you are.

1100
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:01,039
Just look on this as a free checkup.

1101
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,884
- You want me to strip?
- No, just open your mouth.

1102
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,385
Okay.

1103
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,847
Fine.

1104
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,601
Now, breathe deeply.

1105
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:28,317
Have you had any headaches,
earaches or persistent sores?

1106
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,068
Only when I skip foreplay.

1107
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:35,281
Very funny. Now, let me see your eyes.

1108
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,910
You've got it!

1109
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,121
But don't worry. It can be controlled.

1110
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:45,793
Here. Just take two of these
each time you have sexual relations.

1111
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,420
- Before or after?
- Before.

1112
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,381
Well, you better give me
about five of these.

1113
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,841
I'm a guy that really likes to party.
You know what I mean?

1114
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,884
Now make sure you take those.
Otherwise...

1115
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,512
we can't be responsible
for the consequences.

1116
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,516
You wouldn't want to end up like this.

1117
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:05,103
- IChingao!
- What's wrong?

1118
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,067
I better take some more of these pills.

1119
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,693
What pills?

1120
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:15,530
Oh, you know,
they're... they're like vitamins.

1121
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,034
- Damn. I can't get the top off.
- Here. Let me.

1122
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,664
You better give me two of 'em.

1123
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,875
- Who gave these to you?
- A nurse. Why?

1124
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:30,295
They don't look like vitamins.

1125
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:33,423
These are saltpeter.

1126
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,134
That's what they give little kids in camp
so they don't play with themselves.

1127
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,302
- What?
- If you want to force me to make love to you...

1128
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,971
you better not take any more of these.

1129
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,307
Son of a bitch!

1130
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,934
- Your husband did this.
- Did what?

1131
01:07:45,018 --> 01:07:47,603
God, he's fixed it
so I can't make love to you.

1132
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,356
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

1133
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:51,567
- Suture.
- Suture.

1134
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,609
Frying pan.

1135
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,284
Well, there's one consideration.

1136
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:04,078
If you'd done what he'd asked,
he would have died anyway.

1137
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,790
The funny thing is
is that he is a real doctor.

1138
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:10,043
I recognize him from the hospital.
What a world.

1139
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:18,010
Hello? James. Nice of you to call.

1140
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,764
Yes. Of course
we're still interested in the house.

1141
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,765
They have.

1142
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,560
Oh, they are.

1143
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,438
No. We'll just see what we can do.

1144
01:08:29,521 --> 01:08:32,231
Okay. Thank you, James.

1145
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,234
Bye.

1146
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,820
Don't tell me.
There's been another offer on our house?

1147
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,907
We have to come up
with $25,000 by Friday...

1148
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:44,036
or another couple is gonna take the place and
turn it into a clinic for rich, fat people.

1149
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:46,078
Nobody is getting that house but us.

1150
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:49,123
- We'll just have to speed up production.
- Speed up production?

1151
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:55,380
- What about that ritzy swingers party Doris is going to tonight?
- The one with the hot tub.

1152
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,301
Hi, swingers. I'm Howard Swine...

1153
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,136
your horny host
that's hung with the most.

1154
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,972
Though I hate to boast,
I'm big as a post and warm as toast!

1155
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,644
Cool it, Howard. Those are all the things
he couldn't say on the radio...

1156
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,648
so now he's making up
for lost time - constantly.

1157
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,149
I'm so glad you decided to come.

1158
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,152
I come whether I decide to or not.

1159
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:20,572
Great, Howard.
Why don't you go now?

1160
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,033
Hey. You can't fluff me off like that.

1161
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,786
I'm your host -
your horny host that's hung with the most.

1162
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:29,622
Though I hate to boast,
I'm big as a post and warm as toast!

1163
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,501
I knew this party
would be full of assholes.

1164
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,877
It's Doris!

1165
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:38,549
Oh, beat me, Doris! Work me!
Make me write bad checks!

1166
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,341
- Cash his check!
- Scum!

1167
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,345
- You better beg for mercy.
- Give him hell!

1168
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,012
Harder. Harder!

1169
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:52,019
All these bozos have to pretend like
it's all a joke in front of their friends.

1170
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,106
- But half of them will look me up for real next week.
- - Go, go, go.

1171
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:58,318
He'll be back for more.
Happy hunting.

1172
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:02,405
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1173
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:06,952
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go...

1174
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,038
go, go, go, go, go, go!

1175
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,206
- Oh, my. Is she all right?
- What happened?

1176
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,418
- To fine food.
- And great wine.

1177
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,462
Mountain Brook!

1178
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,715
- Just be as honest with me as you can.
- Okay. You're a creep.

1179
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,717
All right. Now let me rephrase that.

1180
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:26,345
Hi. My name is Susan. What's yours?

1181
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,931
I'm Paul, and this is my wife, Mary.

1182
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:32,226
Well, I'm very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

1183
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,271
I was just saying
to my husband Moose over there...

1184
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:38,065
you're a highly unusual looking couple.

1185
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,819
We were wondering if you'd like to
get together with us and have a little fun.

1186
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,613
What did you have in mind?

1187
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,033
Gee, we're up for about anything.

1188
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,578
You see, we're both bi,
so we can go either way.

1189
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,664
But actually, we do like straight sex.

1190
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,958
Moose is into voyeurism...

1191
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,296
and I'm into exhibitionism.

1192
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,300
Oh, we like B&D, but we don't like S&M.

1193
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,385
We met at the A&P.

1194
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,264
But we don't like labels.

1195
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:12,100
Speaking of labels,
that's a marvelous outfit you have on.

1196
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,852
Did you get it at Saks?

1197
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,895
Saks?

1198
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:19,148
Oh, no.
I got the whole thing at Penney's.

1199
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:23,779
Very nice of you to ask us,
but we're actually into Saint Bernards.

1200
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:26,323
Oh, really?

1201
01:11:28,408 --> 01:11:30,868
Well, see you around.

1202
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,912
Moose, honey, they're into doggies.

1203
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,873
- Dogs?
- They're at the right party.

1204
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:40,086
Oh, but look. There are two Guccis
coming on to a Pierre Cardin. Let's go.

1205
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,006
Mary, if I'm really gonna throw myself
into this, I need a stiff drink.

1206
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:46,635
- Can I get you one?
- Oh, no. I think I'll check out the ladies' room.

1207
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,136
- Meet you back here.
- Okay.
- The chick was so fat...

1208
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:52,099
the whole thing just tore loose
from the ceiling and almost killed me.

1209
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:55,394
- Some basket job.
- Yeah? Well, you get what you pay for.

1210
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,186
In Tijuana?

1211
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:13,369
Mrs. Bland. Fancy meeting you here.

1212
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:19,167
Not so old-fashioned
as you pretended after all?

1213
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,753
- Excuse me, Mr. Leech.
- You know, that little scene...

1214
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,755
you played the other day
in my office really turned me on.

1215
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,510
You've no idea. I kept wondering
what the passion was like...

1216
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,887
with the hair down and the clothes off.

1217
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:35,766
And now, I am going to
find out for myself.

1218
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,750
Where are the ludes?

1219
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,644
Hold it up. Hold the bitch up.

1220
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,106
Okay, you two. Mush!

1221
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,940
Good night, Doris!

1222
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,949
- Paul.
- There you are. I was wondering what happened to you.

1223
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,993
Paul, we have to get out of here.
We have to go now.

1224
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,996
You two don't seem to be joining
in the fun and games.

1225
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,289
- Do you have V.D., or are you here as tourists?
- Neither.

1226
01:13:40,373 --> 01:13:42,208
What is your scene anyway?

1227
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,753
We invite swingers to our place
and then murder them for their money.

1228
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,178
Great, man.

1229
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,305
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you say that?

1230
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,809
Oh, why not? He's forgotten already.

1231
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,603
Paul, you're getting drunk.

1232
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:03,771
Paul, I just killed Mr. Leech.

1233
01:14:03,855 --> 01:14:05,606
You know, Mr. Leech from the bank.

1234
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,193
Yeah? Well, I just stepped on
Mr. Snail from the garden.

1235
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,279
No, Paul. I'm not joking.
He came on to me in the bathroom...

1236
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,197
and I killed him with a rattail comb.

1237
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,117
Sounds messy.
Did he have a lot on him?

1238
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,743
Yes, but I couldn't get it.
I had to throw him out the window.

1239
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,328
- Out the window?
- Yes. Here.

1240
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:21,622
But - Is that him?

1241
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,667
Come on. We can get that money.

1242
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:27,170
Come on. Come on, everybody.
It's hot tub time!

1243
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:30,715
Come on! Come on, everybody!
Out of your clothes and into the tub!

1244
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,467
In the tub!

1245
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,719
Last one in is a lousy lay!

1246
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,905
Hey! You two spoilsports.

1247
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,032
What are you doing
over there by the fence?

1248
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,868
None of your damn business!

1249
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:02,289
I'm the host here, goddamn it. Now get out
of your clothes and get into the hot tub...

1250
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,498
- or get the hell out!
- Yeah!

1251
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:07,836
We don't want any wet blankets
or spoilsports at this party.

1252
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,588
We're here to swing, aren't we, kids?

1253
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,425
Oh, yeah? Well, swing on this.

1254
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:22,225
Okay, that's 3,000 there. This is 429.

1255
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,770
And this is - Oh. One, two, three...

1256
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,689
Hello? One-Way Auto?

1257
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,860
Do you have one of those
double-decker car carriers?

1258
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,321
Well, bring it over to 1510 Blue Jay Way.

1259
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:36,322

01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:42,389
Yeah. Tomorrow we can call James,
move in to Paul and Mary's Country Kitchen.

1278
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:44,431
Hey. Did you leave
the light on in the bedroom?

1279
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:47,143
Paul, have you been drinking?
Where did you ge...

1280
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:54,775
So, not only do you try to
make me into a big maricón...

1281
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:58,445
but you sell cars behind my back
and don't even give me a cut.

1282
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,407
Don't worry, chiquita.

1283
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,951
The time has come to liberate you
from this husband of yours.

1284
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:05,119
- Listen, Raoul -
- Shut up!

1285
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,121
You're gonna dump me?

1286
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,833
Well, Mary and me
are gonna dump you, ese.

1287
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,252
Just when you get
this business going great...

1288
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,796
you want to take
this beautiful, sexy woman...

1289
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,007
and stick her in some country kitchen
and make her sweat for you?

1290
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,800
What an asshole.

1291
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,304
- And she's such a lady that she don't even complain.
- Raoul...

1292
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:24,471
Keep cool, baby. I know what I'm doing.

1293
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,515
I got ambition.

1294
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:31,186
We're gonna expand this business...

1295
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:34,064
bring in some real sexy
younger girls to dress up...

1296
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,777
instead of my wife,
who's gonna be too busy having my kids.

1297
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,739
And while she's busy having your children,
the young sexy ones...

1298
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,198
Shut up!

1299
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,577
- Chiquita.
- Yeah?

1300
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:49,247
Go bring me that frying pan.
Hurry up.

1301
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,583
Mary!

1302
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,419
And we're gonna move into a place
that's real class.

1303
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,338
Red velvet wallpaper...

1304
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:59,215
gold lamps...

1305
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,551
and those real good
black velvet paintings.

1306
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,427
No cheap stuff.

1307
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:05,721
I can't find it.

1308
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:07,431
Come on.

1309
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,369
Damn kids broke the compactor.
Must have put bottles in it or something.

1310
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,039
- Paul, what are we gonna do about Raoul?
- Oh, don't worry about him.

1311
01:18:31,122 --> 01:18:33,957
- Don't worry about him?
- I'll drop him off at Doggie King.

1312
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:39,296
Oh, Paul, would - would you mind not
dropping him off at the dog food center?

1313
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,257
- Getting sentimental, Mary?
- No.

1314
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,927
Paul, there's something I never told you.

1315
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:48,139
Raoul and I...

1316
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,891
- I know.
- No.

1317
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,269
- I know.
- Oh, no, Paul. You don't know, because he...

1318
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,146
You see, what happened
is he forced me to smoke this drug...

1319
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,024
and then he raped me.

1320
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:01,236
And then he told me that if I didn't
continue to have relations with him...

1321
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,238
that he was gonna tell you,
and I couldn't let anyone hurt you.

1322
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,200
- And so we continued -
- He deserved everything he got...

1323
01:19:07,283 --> 01:19:09,411
but that's all over now, okay?

1324
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,913
Look. In an hour or so, we're gonna sign
the papers, give James the money...

1325
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:16,458
- James! Paul, I forgot all about James.
- We promised him dinner...

1326
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,377
- I know.
- And he's gonna be here in 45 minutes.

1327
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,963
I'll go to the store and get something.

1328
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:22,214
The store? You can't go to the store.
You don't have time.

1329
01:19:22,298 --> 01:19:25,426
Paul, we've got to improvise something.

1330
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,346
You know, it's times like these,
when I see two great people...

1331
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,764
like you and Mary
get the house of your dreams...

1332
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:34,436
well, my job becomes something more than
just a thing you do from 9:00 to 5:00.

1333
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,271
That's very kind of you, James.

1334
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,272
Oh, listen. I mean it. Really.

1335
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,859
I think it's great
that you made it without...

1336
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,902
knocking other people aside to get there.

1337
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,989
That's a real compliment,
coming from a real estate dealer.

1338
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,782
Maybe I ought to be a wine seller.

1339
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:51,077
I didn't know there was so much money
selling those things door-to-door.

1340
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:53,121
Are you all right?

1341
01:19:53,204 --> 01:19:55,664
Boy, is this stuff terrific.

1342
01:19:55,748 --> 01:19:58,542
Well, I hope you make this
a permanent item on your menu.

1343
01:19:59,627 --> 01:20:00,878
It's French.

1344
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:03,715
No, actually, it's more Spanish.

1345
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:05,800
It's so tender.

1346
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,802
Yeah. I know.

1347
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:12,014
It's amazing what you can do with a cheap
piece of meat if you know how to treat it.

1348
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:14,893
And, of course, the right
wine always helps.

1349
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,644
I'll drink to that.
