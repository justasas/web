1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,039
This programme contains some strong language. 

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,480
# How I wish How I wish you were here 

3
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,920
# We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl 

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,280
# Year after year 

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,479
# Running over the same old ground 

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,119
# What have we found? 

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,759
# The same old fears 

8
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,000
# Wish you were here. # 

9
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,040
It did stem from those first four notes 

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,320
that popped out of the guitar one day in King's Cross. 

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,560
Somehow, those notes evoked a song about Syd 

12
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,240
and his disappearance, absence, if you like, in Roger. 

13
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,599
It's my homage to Syd 

14
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:05,399
and my heartfelt expression of my sadness and... 

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,760
But also my admiration for the talent, and my sadness 

16
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,959
for the loss of the friend. 

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,200
# You were caught in the crossfire 

18
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,239
# Of childhood and stardom 

19
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,800
# Blown on the steel breeze. # 

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,320
I think the song is brilliant in its sort of evocation of what 

21
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,079
Roger obviously felt about Syd, and certainly, it matches mine. 

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,440
I think what was so important was to not try 

23
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,879
and write him out of history. 

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,319
# Come on, you stranger 

25
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,000
# You legend, you martyr 

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,599
# And shine! # 

27
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,479
There are no generalities, really, in that song. 

28
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,119
It's not about, "All the crazy diamonds", it's about Syd. 

29
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,159
THEY VOCALIZE AND EMIT NOISES 

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
When I first saw the Floyd, I remember... 

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,719
I mean, the first thing you noticed was the lights, 

32
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,199
because nobody was doing that then. At least I hadn't seen it. 

33
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,000
But Syd really started to shine. 

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,479
You know, you couldn't really take your eyes off him, 

35
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,280
even in the murk and the purple and green blobs, you know, 

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
the bright-eyed Syd and his singing and his guitar playing 

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
kind of jumped out at you. 

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,719
# Blinding signs flap Flicker, flicker, flicker 

39
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,400
# Blam... Pow! Pow! 

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,360
# Da, da-da, da, da-da, da-da 

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
# Da-da, da-da 

42
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,239
# Ooooh! # 

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,360
By the time I was working with them in the studio, 

44
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,880
it was clear that the real creative shape of the group emanated 

45
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,719
from Syd, although, 

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
you know, it certainly wasn't Syd and backing group. 

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Syd was a very wonderful chap. 

48
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Very, very witty. Very, very sharp. 

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,879
You know, he was out-going, charming, wonderful, friendly. 

50
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,439
You name it. I mean, a wonderful man. 

51
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,040
He was one of the gang, I guess you'd say. 

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
A good friend. Funny. 

53
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,079
Rather annoying, though - he was good looking 

54
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,199
and played guitar and could paint, 

55
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,279
and always had nice girlfriends. 

56
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,399
No-one that you ever really would have imagined 

57
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,519
would wind up the way he did wind up. 

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,079
# Remember when you were young 

59
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
# You shone like the sun 

60
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,799
# Shine on, you crazy diamond. # 

61
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,319
# Little by little The night turns around 

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,600
# Counting the leaves Which tremble at dawn 

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
# Ah, aaah, ah, aaah, ah 

64
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,480
# Ah, aaah, ah, aaah, ah 

65
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,680
# Set the controls For the heart of the sun 

66
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,799
# Heart of the sun 

67
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,439
# Heart of the sun. # 

68
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,800
In this post Dark Side Of The Moon period, 

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,960
we were all having to assess 

70
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,639
what we were in this business for, 

71
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,639
why we were doing it, whether we were artists or business people. 

72
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,159
Having achieved the sort of success 

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,560
and money out of it all that... 

74
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,120
that could fulfil anyone's wildest teenage dreams, 

75
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,399
why we would still want to continue to do it. 

76
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,879
Yeah, I remember the disappointment of Top Of The Pops 

77
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,839
or having the first hit single or whatever. 

78
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,639
It's not as world-shaking 

79
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,159
and changing as perhaps you expect it to be. 

80
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,199
So maybe, you know, because of the enormous success 

81
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
of Dark Side, there was still that sense of, 

82
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,199
"Well, this hasn't made us feel enormously different or satisfied." 

83
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,360
Roger, I think, has sometimes said that he thinks 

84
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,520
that we were kind of finished at that point, 

85
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,439
and he may have been right. 

86
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I think we were at a watershed then, 

87
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,319
and we could easily have split up then. 

88
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,879
And we didn't, because we were frightened 

89
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,000
of the great out there, beyond the umbrella 

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,399
of this extraordinarily powerful and valuable trade name - Pink Floyd. 

91
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,239
It was the first song they played, and it was like, "Whoa," 

92
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
it was like singing about Syd Barrett. 

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,720
The band that was known for their musicality, 

94
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,800
they weren't doing their music justice. 

95
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,639
Do you recall there was a famous review by Nick Kent? 

96
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,759
How could I forget? 

97
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,399
I kind of over-reacted, obviously. 

98
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,519
I mean, I feel now that I over-reacted, 

99
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,600
but at the same time, they partly deserved it. 

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
It was a bad gig. 

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
It was, it was shambolic. 

102
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,200
I mean it was...it lacked enthusiasm and it lacked a sort of purpose, 

103
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,520
a sense of purpose, and I don't really know why. 

104
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,879
From my perspective now, to look back upon how I felt then, 

105
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,480
scared as I was of my own shadow, you know, 

106
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,399
never mind my relationship with audiences, 

107
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,399
and there were real concerns about not making any contact 

108
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,879
with the audience during much of that tour of England 

109
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,159
that we did in 1974. 

110
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,199
And we didn't. We were... we were very disconnected. 

111
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,600
If we weren't giving 100%, we couldn't quite sort out why not. 

112
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
You know, there was an element of frustration 

113
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,439
in having someone tell us that. 

114
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,600
I think we probably knew it and couldn't quite sort of deal with it. 

115
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,879
That review would have been one of the things which would have - 

116
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,519
once we'd got over our initial ire - we would have taken on board 

117
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,799
and realised that there was more than a germ of truth in it. 

118
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,480
I was asked to record the Floyd at what was then called 

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,600
the Empire Pool, which is now the Wembley Arena, 

120
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,040
and when I saw the Floyd before they went on, they said, 

121
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,519
"Oh, do us a favour, will you go and sit with our sound engineer?" 

122
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,799
And I said, "OK." 

123
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,399
How long is it since you've been here, Brian? 

124
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,159
30 years. 

125
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,839
And anyhow, 

126
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,560
I went back in the interval and they said 

127
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,079
"Well, what do you think?" And I said, "It's rubbish." 

128
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,000
Because I'd been used to working with smaller groups 

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,559
on smaller mixing desks, and theirs was massive. 

130
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,879
So anyway, cut a long story short, 

131
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,799
next thing I knew, I was doing the next night at the Empire Pool. 

132
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,279
Oh, God, this does take me back. 

133
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,279
And then I ended up doing the rest of the British tour. 

134
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,000
Somebody better just run through this. 

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,080
And then, as I say, then came Wish You Were Here. 

136
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,360
There were a lot of days where we didn't do anything, 

137
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
while they were thinking about ideas. 

138
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,600
The reality was that we were struggling with making the follow-up 

139
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,200
to Dark Side, and we rushed back in to the studio to do that. 

140
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,080
You know, we put ourselves under a sort of ridiculous pressure, 

141
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,240
in a way, trying to make a record from nothing. 

142
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,120
It was disengagement. 

143
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,080
It was not being willing to apply yourself sufficiently. 

144
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,000
A lot of moments where any one of us might have been much more 

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,879
interested in thinking about what they were doing that weekend. 

146
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,120
It became a case of two would be in the studio and two were running 

147
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,159
late or, as it was always known, they were out playing squash. 

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,080
And then we had the dartboard with the air rifle. 

149
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,320
The concentrated activity was rather diluted, 

150
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,240
and I'm sure for a... 

151
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,919
..a very pushing, driving sort of person 

152
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,719
like Roger, it was more frustrating than it was for anyone else, 

153
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,960
although considerably frustrating for all of us, I suspect. 

154
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,400
When I'm in the studio, I'm there to do something, 

155
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,120
otherwise I'd rather be somewhere else, frankly. 

156
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,679
So I'm there to work. 

157
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,120
Well, you know, there's the legendary argument 

158
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,519
that I must have had with the rest of them about... 

159
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,879
..my thought at the time that it would be better to use 

160
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,519
the other two tracks as well that we had been working on. 

161
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,879
I had to fight David for a bit, as he acknowledges completely, 

162
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,919
you know. 

163
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,959
We had a completely different idea about it, 

164
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,879
and that was a...that was a fight that I won. 

165
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,240
Dave saw a record that had those two songs and Shine On, 

166
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,919
and it felt cobbled together to me. 

167
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,360
It didn't feel like real. 

168
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,240
And so at some point in that process, yeah, 

169
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,720
I came up with the idea of, "No, this has to be thematic," 

170
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,200
and that's the way I expressed it. 

171
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,360
This will make this a more coherent work, 

172
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,720
and because it's more coherent, 

173
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
it will be better than if we just throw all the songs 

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,200
we've been working on together and go boom, there you are, that's it. 

175
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,879
There's one song that's about Syd, but the rest of it isn't. 

176
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,320
It's a much more universal expression of my feelings 

177
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,400
about absence... 

178
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,800
..because I felt that we weren't really there, 

179
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,279
we were very absent. 

180
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,919
I remembered it. 

181
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
# Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar 

182
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,920
# You're gonna go far. # 

183
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,120
"Come in here and have a cigar," 

184
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,159
you know, and become a star and become immortal. 

185
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,120
# You're gonna make it if you try 

186
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,840
# They're gonna love you. # 

187
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,560
You become part of the whole buying and selling machine. 

188
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,000
It's high. 

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,919
I would need to do a number of vocal exercises before I attempted that. 

190
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,039
I think the lyrics so much sum up the recording business. 

191
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
Rock 'n' roll, man. 

192
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,319
# Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar 

193
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,360
# You're gonna go far. # 

194
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,240
The record companies were... they were all-powerful, in a way. 

195
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,080
No-one worked without a record deal in those days, 

196
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,840
so they had a lot of power. 

197
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:43,719
You're not longer really an individual any more, 

198
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,840
you're just...you're a cipher, 

199
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,519
you're playing a part, you're a puppet. 

200
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,079
You're not your own man. 

201
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,840
# The weather's just fantastic That is really what I think 

202
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,440
# Oh, by the way Which one's Pink? # 

203
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,720
By the way, which one is Pink? 

204
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,879
Which one's Pink? 

205
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,080
Which one's Pink? 

206
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,639
# And did we tell you The name of the game, boy? 

207
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,120
# We call it Riding the gravy train. # 

208
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,720
It was felt that Syd's madness had partly come about 

209
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,639
through the demands of the record industry. 

210
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,799
"You've had a hit, now I want you to do another hit." 

211
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,919
"I want you another hit, and I want another hit." 

212
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,120
"And that's not as good as your last hit." 

213
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,039
"That's not as good as your last record," you know, 

214
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,319
"And I want you to do a bigger show and have more lights 

215
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,600
"and more people." 

216
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
I mean, it's... 

217
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,759
"Hey, all I wanted to do is to play a guitar 

218
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,200
"and write a song, and suddenly I'm in the middle of all this." 

219
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,080
The star thing doesn't make... doesn't make you happy, you know. 

220
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,200
That, the star thing, can make you want to withdraw from society. 

221
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,000
# It's awfully considerate of you To think of me here 

222
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,399
# And I'm most obliged to you For making it clear 

223
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,199
# That I'm not here. # 

224
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,960
Well, you could argue that Syd was burned by the music business, 

225
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,519
but actually, he was probably burned more by us. 

226
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,240
# And I never knew the moon... # 

227
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,720
Syd had sort of gone off the idea of doing Top Of The Pops, 

228
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
and being sort of commercial. 

229
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,759
# ..shoes and brought me here. # 

230
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,839
I think it wasn't the record company putting the pressure on, it was us 

231
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,199
putting the pressure on, because that's the way we wanted to go. 

232
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,960
# I don't care If the sun doesn't shine 

233
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,880
# And I don't care If nothing is mine 

234
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,360
# And I don't care If I'm nervous with you 

235
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,559
# I'll do my loving in the winter. # 

236
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,319
# Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar 

237
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,599
# You're gonna go far 

238
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,279
# Fly high... # 

239
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,879
With Have A Cigar, 

240
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,920
both of them knew that neither of them could sing it. 

241
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,560
I always thought that Dave's voice was not deep enough. 

242
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,119
# I've always had a deep respect I mean that most sincerely. # 

243
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,359
Yeah, that's Dave. 

244
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,519
# I think the band's fantastic That is really what I think 

245
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,079
# By the way, which one's Pink? # 

246
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,119
That's Roger. 

247
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,839
They wanted the ferocity which Roger gives on other tracks. 

248
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,519
At the time, he just felt that he hadn't got it. 

249
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,319
"Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar. 

250
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,279
"You're gonna go far." 

251
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,440
Roy was definitely one of the great characters around for a lot 

252
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,600
of our early... our early life, really. 

253
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,960
We used to do quite a lot of shows where Roy would be on the bill. 

254
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,319
A good guy to have around. 

255
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,079
I was in Studio 2 and they were in Studio 3. 

256
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,319
I think Roy was actually rather... 

257
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,559
..lacking in momentum himself. 

258
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,919
I think we were... 

259
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,000
It didn't only seem to affect Pink Floyd. 

260
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
You know, that's why I have this vision, 

261
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
I guess, of me being in and out all the time, in and out, in and out. 

262
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,479
He spent quite a lot of time in the studio with us. 

263
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Very expensive recording time that he would spend just 

264
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,680
in our control room chattering and... 

265
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,759
Anyway, I digress. 

266
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,839
Roger was really struggling with it, 

267
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,359
and then Dave... then they both tried. 

268
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,119
There was a lot of arguing about how we were going to do it 

269
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,079
and how we were going to make it work. 

270
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,480
At one point Roy, who was in the room, piped up and said... 

271
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,599
I just said, "I'll do it if you like, for a price." 

272
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,959
# I've always had a deep respect and I mean that most sincerely 

273
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,480
I mean, Roy really put his heart in this. 

274
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,079
I mean, I can picture him now... 

275
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,720
# Which one's Pink? # 

276
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
..putting his heart and soul in to it, 

277
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,079
as if his life depended on it. 

278
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,039
# You gotta get an album out You owe it to the people 

279
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,319
# We're so happy We can hardly count. # 

280
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,720
I mean, the lyrics... 

281
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,959
If I'd have written those lyrics, I'd feel well pleased. 

282
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,000
# And did we tell you The name of the game, boy 

283
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,279
# We call it Riding the gravy train. # 

284
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,879
It was played millions of times around the world as a single. 

285
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,080
That was my vocals on a... You know, really... 

286
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,159
a kind of a number one selling single. 

287
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,440
Everybody thought it was Roger. 

288
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,279
I was a bit peed off about that. 

289
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,079
I think if I'd sung it, it would be more vulnerable 

290
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,559
and less cynical than the way he did it. 

291
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,000
But that's not the way Roy sings. 

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,480
He went off and did it and did a great job, and thank you very much. 

293
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,840
I don't think Roger liked his version terribly much, 

294
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,879
but I think his version is the perfect version. 

295
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,160
He was singing a sort of parody, anyway... 

296
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
..which I don't like. I never liked it. 

297
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,799
The worst of it is that sometimes when I'm doing, 

298
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,200
you know, when I'm doing a gig... 

299
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,439
..there's some wag'll shout, "Have A Cigar", you know. 

300
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,920
I regret it, and that's not 

301
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,480
cos I've got anything against Roy, I haven't, you know. 

302
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,920
And, um... 

303
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,319
I think if I'd persevered with it, I would have done it better. 

304
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,559
# Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar 

305
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,359
# You're gonna go far 

306
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,679
# You're gonna fly high 

307
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,120
# You're never gonna die You're gonna make it if you try 

308
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,159
# They're gonna love you. # 

309
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,000
I was so unbelievably thrilled 

310
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,400
to be there, and I was just very young, 

311
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,680
I was just about 21. 

312
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,840
There is actually a rather nice picture of me 

313
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,399
that Nick Mason took, and it sort of sums up, because I just look 

314
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
wide-eyed and, 

315
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
you know, thrilled is the only word, I think. 

316
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,960
I'd baked some fairy cakes, 

317
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,640
and I thought it would be a good idea to bring them to the studio. 

318
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,080
There's this wonderful sequence of Roger proving that he did 

319
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,639
enjoy the cake. 

320
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,840
I think that Nick took these pictures, 

321
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,000
because I can't imagine that I had the courage to sort of, 

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
you know, take them, but perhaps I did. 

323
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,439
Roger is in the driving seat in these pictures, 

324
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,440
as far as the studio's concerned, and perhaps that position is hard. 

325
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,480
But, actually, it's probably better 

326
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,720
if just one person is in the driving seat. 

327
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,120
Roger, actually, you know, kept a tight hold on the helm, 

328
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,839
and that's what he - that's what he did. 

329
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,919
And, you know, you can't gainsay that, 

330
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,480
because the records, you know, the records were very good. 

331
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,920
Dark Side was just a such a sort of thing. 

332
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,640
All the pieces fell into place, 

333
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,960
or as Nick Mason says, 

334
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,360
"The drumming did it." 

335
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,479
So I think that that was quite hard to deal with. 

336
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,279
What do you do next? What do you do to top it? 

337
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,039
What do you do to be different? 

338
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,039
Well, I couldn't draw, 

339
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,879
so fantasy pictures were out. 

340
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,520
I couldn't paint, so artsy fartsy was out. 

341
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,720
I wasn't a graphic designer, and also, I was not interested 

342
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,960
in band pictures, because I found them a bit dull, you know, a group 

343
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,960
of four musicians who play guitar, drums and bass or keyboards 

344
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,360
would seem to me to be four musicians. They could be anybody. 

345
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:08,639
We always felt that representing the music was the order of the day. 

346
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,720
I know, it sounds radical, even revolutionary! 

347
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,920
So in order to represent the music, one didn't really want to be limited 

348
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,800
in the great palette of art and life to a picture of four geezers. 

349
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,639
We'd mostly, in those days, left it to Storm to come up with 

350
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,800
things which we would give him a desultory two minutes 

351
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:37,240
of our mixing time, to say that one, maybe, that one, not that, not that. 

352
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,400
They were recording at Abbey Road, and I remember going there, 

353
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,280
and I remember I was very... 

354
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,240
I was very nervous in doing the presentation. 

355
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
He came up with these - this, you know, from the lyrics, 

356
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,679
from this theme of absence, and it just seemed like a very good idea. 

357
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,480
I remember getting a little round of applause. 

358
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,440
I was most gratified, I can tell you. 

359
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,360
Storm, actually, is probably one of the most argumentative people 

360
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,439
you could ever meet. 

361
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,039
Roger and Storm would have these intense conversations 

362
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,639
over fine wines and so on. 

363
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,240
Storm and Roger were two great intellects and, you know, 

364
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,640
there was sparks flying in their brains, those two. 

365
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,120
I got very pre-occupied with four, with the number four. 

366
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,319
There were four words in the title, four members of the band, 

367
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,839
and four elements to life - air, fire, water and earth. 

368
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,879
So the first thing that was done was a postcard. 

369
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
The postcard said "Wish You Were Here." 

370
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,360
Po found this fantastic location, called Lake Mono, 

371
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,559
which is such an amazing location 

372
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,839
that you could just about photograph a plastic duck in it 

373
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,919
and you'd like it. 

374
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,160
We always thought there was an element of Storm loving to find 

375
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,600
the most expensive, distant location in the world 

376
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,480
so he could go off and have a little jolly for a few days at our expense. 

377
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,960
This guy is doing a yoga position 

378
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,240
in a yoga chair locked into the mud, 

379
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,759
poor man, with a breathing apparatus on. 

380
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,359
And he had to hold his breath so I didn't get any bubbles. 

381
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:13,439
That's all shot for real. That's not airbrushed or cut or anything. 

382
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,240
That was a moment in time on a magical evening, 

383
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,480
with amazing light. 

384
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,799
Did that take a long time to set up, that shot? 

385
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,359
A fucking long time. 

386
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,439
This shot was a pain in the arse. 

387
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,319
I came to the notice of Pink Floyd, 

388
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,200
because I made a film in Los Angeles for the BBC. 

389
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
I thought that I would do a kind of a visual diary 

390
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
of Americana at that time. 

391
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,759
So I drew everything that I could think of at the time, 

392
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,160
like Black Power, Playboy magazine, Mickey Mouse. 

393
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,720
Hi, guys. 

394
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,399
There was a fantastic Mickey Mouse sequence, where Mickey 

395
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
goes from being the mouse to being a sort of drug crazed mouse. 

396
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,879
HE SIGHS 

397
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Hey, man. That was far out, man. 

398
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,720
Mickey's such a clean living guy, and there he was... 

399
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,079
..on drugs. 

400
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,599
I thought it was absolutely brilliant, and I just thought 

401
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,879
this, we could really... 

402
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
It'd be great to work with someone who produced 

403
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,799
something like this. 

404
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,680
And I took it to Roger and showed Roger and Roger loved it. 

405
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,200
It was very awkward, like all relationships at the beginning, 

406
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
because they wanted one thing from me, 

407
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,800
and I wasn't coming up with the goods, I felt. 

408
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,639
When I say this to Roger today, he says, "Oh, I don't remember that." 

409
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,960
I just remember it was an enormous relief 

410
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,200
after a lot of the flailing around visually 

411
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,720
that we'd done with Dark Side Of The Moon. 

412
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,360
I think the Sandman is a particularly great image. 

413
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,720
You know, the fact that we're all bits of sand that can blow away, 

414
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,920
I think it's just an idea I had, really. 

415
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,160
I wanted to do the impermanence of life or whatever, you know. 

416
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,279
It all sounds rather... pretentious crap, really. 

417
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,400
The beginning of the record sounds very melancholy, 

418
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
and is very melancholy and is melancholy music. 

419
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,880
Sort of blues, 

420
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
it's a sort of G Minor blues that whole first six or seven minutes. 

421
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:17,559
We obviously found a mood that we wanted to not exactly jam to, 

422
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:20,559
but play around with and find something within. 

423
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,439
And we were never too afraid of leaving quite a long period 

424
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,039
of time instrumental before vocals came in. 

425
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,200
You see, at the time, it was a case of let's see what works. 

426
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,759
So then, hence, the wine glass tape came out. 

427
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,839
The wine glasses were recorded for an album 

428
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,319
they were going to make called Household Objects, 

429
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,480
which we had on a loop 

430
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,200
and then Rick then built up the sound 

431
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,759
with synthesisers and organ. 

432
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,720
They wanted a big sound, so the guitar was recorded 

433
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
in a different studio, 

434
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
so hence the click track. 

435
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,559
He put his amplifiers and speakers down in studio one... 

436
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,479
..being a classical music studio, and then mic'd it from a distance. 

437
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,759
I think it comes across on the album. 

438
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,079
You could picture it being played out somewhere in an auditorium. 

439
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,840
This will be Rick featured on the end of Shine On, 

440
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,839
where he really came in to his element. 

441
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,119
You have a Hammond organ on there, you have grand piano... 

442
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,559
..plus the other synthesised instruments he plays. 

443
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,759
I can't remember exactly what synthesiser that was, 

444
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:04,720
but this is Richard's...trademark. 

445
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,919
He's a great piano player, 

446
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,080
and does highlight, I think, his classical training. 

447
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,480
And I think if he'd had another 20 minutes, you would have heard 

448
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,880
probably like a Rick Wright concerto. 

449
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,880
And at the very end, where he does the tribute to Syd Barrett, 

450
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,880
I don't remember if that was just Rick thinking of that 

451
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,360
at the spur of the moment. 

452
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,159
That was a nice... a nice touching thing. 

453
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,960
He was kind of a crazy diamond, 

454
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,079
and all the things it says about him 

455
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,720
in those brilliant lines are very, very accurate, you know. 

456
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,799
"You wore out your welcome with random precision", 

457
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,480
was certainly a part of him. 

458
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,440
# Well, you wore out your welcome With random precision 

459
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,600
# Rode on the steel breeze 

460
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,759
# Come on, you raver, 

461
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,359
# You seer of visions 

462
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,559
# Come on, you painter, you piper 

463
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,240
# You prisoner, and shine! # 

464
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,639
My memory is that we were recording a Radio One show 

465
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,120
at the BBC... 

466
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,240
..and Syd didn't turn up. 

467
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,759
And I think it was a Friday. 

468
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,400
And no-one could find him. 

469
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,519
So we basically waited and waited, and I think 

470
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,400
we had to cancel the recording, or we tried to do some without him, 

471
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm not sure, and then the managers went off trying to find him. 

472
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,759
And when they found Syd, which I think was a Sunday or Monday, 

473
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,840
they told us, "Well, something's happened to Syd." 

474
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,439
And something had happened to him, total difference. 

475
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,000
And I remember him being right like this, and looking in his eyes, 

476
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,079
and it was just like... 

477
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,119
HE MAKES CLICKING NOISE 

478
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,239
..somebody had turned the lights out, you know, 

479
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,879
he just looked so blank. 

480
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,599
He was a living with a whole sort of community of people who were 

481
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,559
very much believing acid can release you and, you know, 

482
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,880
get to the truth and all that stuff, 

483
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,760
and...he took too much. 

484
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,440
And he went up on stage 

485
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,159
and he just stood there for long stretches 

486
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,559
and he'd play the guitar for a bit and then he'd stop. 

487
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,880
He had done so much damage, because acid, that's what it does to you. 

488
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,160
Too much acid will literally fry your brains. 

489
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,000
# Nobody knows where you are 

490
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,360
# How near or how far 

491
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:18,839
# Shine on, you crazy diamond. # 

492
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,760
We were unable to help Syd and probably, I won't say deliberately, 

493
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,040
but had our own interests at heart, and so consequently 

494
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,119
probably tried to hold on to him for far longer than we should have done. 

495
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,879
Syd left the band in 1968. 

496
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,280
Syd was only around for that one record, it was a tiny piece. 

497
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,200
It was a very important piece, it was the opening piece 

498
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,119
of the Pink Floyd Story, and it may well be that Pink Floyd 

499
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,519
would never have started and would have never carried on 

500
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,239
and nothing would have happened. We will never know. 

501
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:03,599
He was a real hindrance to the band in many ways. 

502
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,360
Having said that, we simply wouldn't have got to where we got to. 

503
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,920
There would be no Dark Side Of The Moon if Syd 

504
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,480
hadn't been around to take us on that first major step. 

505
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
I found it so upsetting working with Syd in those days. 

506
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,440
It was like trying to...seeing someone sort of drowning 

507
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,720
and trying to pull them out, but they kept on slip...you know, 

508
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,119
the hand slipped away all the time. 

509
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,000
We were hoping that it would be therapeutic for him 

510
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,639
and might help him come back. 

511
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,519
Trying...it was like trying to bring him back. 

512
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,360
"Come back, Syd, come back." 

513
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,000
And there was never likely to be any way back, and that is... 

514
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,600
..quite awful to think about. 

515
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,920
GUITAR MUSIC 

516
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,840
# You reached for the secret too soon 

517
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,240
# You cried for the moon 

518
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,559
# Shine on you crazy diamond. # 

519
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,880
And of course, they loved their ooohs, 

520
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,960
so we just oooh'd them, 

521
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,440
saying, "Shine on, you crazy diamond," and just oooh'd 

522
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,200
the rest of the way. They loved ooohs. 

523
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,519
Carlena and Venetta, being Americans and soulful, 

524
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,039
was a wonderful contrast 

525
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,840
between the sort of Britishness of Pink Floyd. 

526
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,079
I didn't know them from a bar of soap, 

527
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,759
and I didn't like their music in the beginning. 

528
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,240
It was all in a minor key, it was all very low, 

529
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:23,439
and everything was oohs and ahhs. Who are these people? 

530
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,240
I thought Motown was meticulous, but this was the most meticulous 

531
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,319
four musicians that I had ever seen work before. 

532
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,360
And something told me in my head, "Venetta, 

533
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,599
"you're here for a reason, you must enjoy this music, 

534
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,480
"you must get on with this music, cos you're here, 

535
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,599
"there's something for you to learn." 

536
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,519
They managed to do their job without getting involved in the band 

537
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,280
politics, so those two were very good at just.. 

538
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,720
You know, we might be all furious with each other 

539
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:00,480
about something or other and having some great row 

540
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,199
at the dinner table or in the car on the way to the show or whatever, 

541
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,679
and they'd just be very, very relaxed and just get on with it. 

542
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,199
And they always sang beautifully. 

543
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,239
One of my fondest, fondest memories of being with Pink Floyd 

544
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,519
recording Shine On You Crazy Diamond, 

545
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,639
because that was the only thing that we got to actually record with them, 

546
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,400
as opposed to singing-performing Dark Side Of The Moon. 

547
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,480
So that was the great thing about it, we actually got on a record. 

548
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,840
# Shine on, you crazy diamond. # 

549
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,599
Welcome To The Machine. 

550
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,639
They just wanted bits of ad-hoc animation bunged into the show 

551
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,279
willy nilly. And, of course, 

552
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,080
I had my little team of animators who are strictly trained to work 

553
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,159
to a track, and without a track, they don't know what to do. 

554
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,159
And I used to go and tell Roger this, 

555
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,199
and he said, "It doesn't matter about a track, just let them do something." 

556
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,840
I assume he made all that spherical stuff having heard 

557
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,039
the VCS3 throbbing at the beginning of Welcome To The Machine. 

558
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,159
Boom, boom, boom, boom... All of that stuff. 

559
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,719
HE CLICKS AND WHIRS 

560
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,079
When it came to Welcome To The Machine, 

561
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,799
I think Roger was really getting into his synthesisers. 

562
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,039
So, hence you have all these different effects. 

563
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean, some of these noises are, to me, just futuristic. 

564
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,920
I loved that machine. 

565
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,440
I used it a lot back in the day. 

566
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,000
I've still got one. It's still good for wind and explosions. 

567
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,519
THROBBING 

568
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,800
See, and the throb 

569
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,519
is basically what Roger would have played on bass. 

570
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
He adds to it later on with the real bass. 

571
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,400
THROBBING AND BASS 

572
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,200
The only real instruments that really are on there are 

573
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,960
Dave's acoustics. 

574
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,440
'One, two, three, four...' 

575
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,360
GUITAR 

576
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,079
DRUMS 

577
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,639
To add a bit more to the aggression of the song, 

578
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,759
the timps and cymbals were added. 

579
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,000
It just sounded like a very angry song to me, always did. 

580
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,119
Very angry. 

581
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,519
That somebody was getting something out of their system. 

582
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:06,519
# Welcome, my son 

583
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,400
# Welcome to the machine 

584
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,679
# Where have you been? 

585
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,840
# It's all right We know where you've been 

586
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,200
This particular creature I created, 

587
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,559
I remember showing it to the gang, 

588
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,559
who sort of went along with everything I said at that point, 

589
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,559
they didn't sort of correct anything. 

590
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,840
Roger, particularly, has this idea that 

591
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,680
if you hire an artist, 

592
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,719
you don't try and change what that artist does, 

593
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,119
you hire an artist for what he does. 

594
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,599
Gerry has a very similar kind of...bolshie attitude 

595
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,599
towards all status quo and all the powers that be that I do. 

596
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,199
# So, welcome... 

597
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:10,000
# To the machine. # 

598
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,559
And the sea of blood that comes towards us 

599
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,480
and crashes through the steel towers. 

600
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,000
God knows what it's about. 

601
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,039
But I thought it was a very kind of a strong image, a sea of blood. 

602
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:28,000
I did really add piece by piece the animation, so when I'd done 

603
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,119
the sea of blood, Roger probably said we need it a bit longer. 

604
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:40,880
So then the sea of blood had to turn into hands, praying, 

605
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,320
grasping hands, 

606
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,280
hopeless lost kind of hands, I suppose, 

607
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,600
searching for some god or some reason to it all. 

608
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,240
You could say that Welcome To The Machine 

609
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,159
is only about my experience in the music industry... 

610
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,079
It's not, it's about all of our experience 

611
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,840
in the face of that monstrous, 

612
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,120
grinding thing that chews us up and spits us out. 

613
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,280
In the meetings that Storm and I had, one of the topics 

614
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,519
was somebody getting burnt in the business, you know, 

615
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,199
which was an expression at the time. "Man, I've been burned." 

616
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:34,359
You know, so, what more logical, kind of, concept, if you like, 

617
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,160
would be than two men shaking hands and one of them is getting burnt? 

618
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,000
And we both went, "Yeah!" Maybe because it was so outrageous. 

619
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,719
And these are the days before computers, 

620
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,759
so it meant setting a man on fire, which we did. 

621
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Yeah, it wasn't very difficult. Issuing orders from the bunker, 

622
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,880
it's really easy. "Over the top, men." 

623
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,519
Anyway, that was done for real in a studio lot in Hollywood. 

624
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,960
What could be more absent than a studio lot? 

625
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,359
I believe it was a Warner Brothers lot. 

626
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,519
I was doing a lot 

627
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:14,920
of fire work in those days, 

628
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,119
and I had the special suits 

629
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,440
and all this stuff 

630
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,159
for full envelop fire, but a partial is basically, 

631
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:26,319
you know, a pretty safe, pretty easy one to do. 

632
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,120
And... In most cases. 

633
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,480
He had a team of...20 people around him with fire extinguishers, 

634
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,119
ready to deal with any emergency. 

635
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,279
The effects man will step out 

636
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,160
and he's got a wand about that long with a fire on the end of it, 

637
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,079
and they go, "We're ready, action, and he just touches the three 

638
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,440
or four spots like that, steps out, everything is burning, 

639
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,760
and it's a still picture, so shake...shaking hands - 

640
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,240
nothing to it. 

641
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,279
And after I had shot about, I suppose, 15 shots, 

642
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,360
and 15 times for somebody to catch fire is rather a lot, 

643
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,039
suddenly a gust of breeze came up. 

644
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,000
And the fire whipped round his face. 

645
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,480
There's a funny thing about fire - when it gets in your face 

646
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,280
you're going to move, that's just part of the thing. 

647
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,840
And once it blew it around, I turned as fast as I could. 

648
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,480
He fell to the ground, absolutely smothered with foam 

649
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,320
and blankets and everything like that. He got up and he said, 

650
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,120
"That's it, no more." 

651
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,319
Luckily, I got it in the can. 

652
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,600
And here we see his foot leaving frame. 

653
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,759
And that's a sort of surreal image of absence in itself, you know? 

654
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,280
But that's real absence. 

655
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,560
Out of frame, out of sight, you know? 

656
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,159
And you just kept shooting? 

657
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,519
I just kept shooting, yeah. 

658
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:43,639
I mean, I had to get this shot and it had to be right. 

659
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:49,199
So, you know, I didn't have time to be concerned with his singed body. 

660
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,639
You know, if they want somebody burning and they're going to pay me, 

661
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,519
I don't care if they have an artist drawing the fire. 

662
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,240
When developing a theme of absence, 

663
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,639
it seemed therefore appropriate that in the end, 

664
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,159
the cover should be absent. 

665
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,319
The...um... Got it here. 

666
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,480
The...um... 

667
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,360
This is the end piece, or the end part of the puzzle. 

668
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,760
Anyway, the record company, especially in America, 

669
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,200
went complete apeshit. 

670
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,239
"You mean wrap Wish You Were Here in black opaque shrink wrap 

671
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,719
"so you can't see it? Are you completely fucking mad?" 

672
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:33,000
But you had to have a sticker that said what it was, 

673
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,840
otherwise the factory wouldn't pack it properly, 

674
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,320
let alone the fans buy it. 

675
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,480
I hear stories that there are some aficionados... 

676
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,039
..who have had...who have had Wish You Were Here for many a year now, 

677
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:52,079
and have carefully slit the opaque vinyl shrink wrap 

678
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,400
and extracted the record 

679
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,280
and actually haven't seen the cover in 35 years. 

680
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,200
Brilliant. That's really absent. 

681
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:17,319
Well, that's the one I can remember quite clearly. 

682
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,519
That was me strumming a 12 string guitar, 

683
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,840
which I'd recently purchased from a guy I know, 

684
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,440
and coming up with, you know, the opening riff 

685
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,840
of Wish You Were Here. 

686
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:35,199
And again, like... 

687
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,239
like the four notes at the beginning of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, 

688
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:40,519
other people start going, "Hey, 

689
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:42,440
"that's good, you've got something there." 

690
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,079
And I said to him, "What's that you're playing? That's really nice." 

691
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,759
And he played it. 

692
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,560
And I said, "That's really good. 

693
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:59,919
"Maybe I should try and do something with it." 

694
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,480
I think Roger and I then worked on writing the verses 

695
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,159
and putting those chords in to the... in to the whole thing, and Roger... 

696
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,520
..did those brilliant words, and there we were. 

697
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,119
# Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts 

698
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,799
# Hot ashes for trees 

699
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,920
# Hot air for a cool breeze 

700
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,840
# Cold comfort for change 

701
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,799
# And did you exchange 

702
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,519
# A walk on part in the war 

703
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,039
# For a lead role in a cage? # 

704
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,480
That collaboration between David and I, I think is, you know, 

705
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,800
really good. All bits of it are really, really good. 

706
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,480
So I'm very happy about it. 

707
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,679
# So, so you think you can tell 

708
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,240
# Heaven from hell 

709
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,600
# Blue skies from pain 

710
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,880
# Can you tell a green field 

711
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,239
# From a cold, steel rail? 

712
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,119
# A smile from a veil? 

713
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,079
# Do you think you can tell? # 

714
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,719
I think most of the songs that I've ever written 

715
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,159
all pose similar questions. 

716
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,960
Can you free yourself enough to be able to experience the reality 

717
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,079
of life as it goes on before you 

718
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,599
and with you, and as you go on as part of it or not? 

719
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:04,519
Because if you can't, you stand on square one until you die. 

720
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,159
And I know that may sound like bullshit, 

721
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,480
but that's what the song is about. 

722
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,000
# How I wish How I wish you were here 

723
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:22,480
# We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl 

724
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,559
# Year after year 

725
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:30,279
# Running over the same old ground 

726
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,000
# What have we found? 

727
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,639
# The same old fears 

728
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:37,239
# Wish you were here. # 

729
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,800
All the songs are encouraging me, 

730
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,280
I guess I write them for me, 

731
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,560
and it's to encourage myself... 

732
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,880
..not to accept a lead role in a cage... 

733
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,159
..but to go on demanding of myself 

734
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,000
that I keep auditioning 

735
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,400
for the walk on part in the war, because that's where I want to be. 

736
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,119
I want to be in the trenches. 

737
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,079
I don't want to be at headquarters or I don't want to be sitting 

738
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,199
in a hotel somewhere. 

739
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,719
I want to be... I want to be engaged... 

740
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,599
..probably, I might say, 

741
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,199
in a way that my father would approve of. 

742
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,480
It's a very simple sort of country song, if you like. 

743
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,280
It's still... Because of its resonance 

744
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,560
and the emotional weight it carries, 

745
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,320
it is one of our best songs. 

746
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,159
People do attach to it lots of internal feelings that they may have, 

747
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,440
and they may not be entirely sure what it's about, and neither am I. 

748
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,320
I mean, I'm only telling you what it's about for me. 

749
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,920
But there's no reason why other people shouldn't put 

750
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,360
other interpretations on it, which could be just as valid. 

751
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:20,839
Although Shine On You Crazy Diamond 

752
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,160
is the one that is specifically about Syd, and Wish You Were Here 

753
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,719
has a broader remit... 

754
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,760
..I can't sing it without thinking about Syd. 

755
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,039
My memory is that I came in to the studio 

756
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:52,279
and there was this guy standing there in a Gabardine raincoat, 

757
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,200
and a large, large bloke, and I had no idea who it was. 

758
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,599
And surprisingly, no-one's saying, "Who's that person? 

759
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:04,400
"What's he doing wandering around all our gear in the studio?" 

760
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,079
And then...then him coming in to the control room and standing around, 

761
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:15,599
and how remarkable, how long it was before anyone actually woke up. 

762
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,759
Finally, I think it was David who said, "Nick, do you recognise him?" 

763
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,480
And I looked and I think I either shrugged my shoulders 

764
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,719
or at some point Dave sort of put me out of my misery 

765
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:33,480
and said, "It's Syd". 

766
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,440
And we just sort of stood there, 

767
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,480
or sat there and just were shell-shocked, basically. 

768
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,239
And then until somebody thought of something to say to him. 

769
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,239
And then we were all unbelievably shocked at his appearance. 

770
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,599
I mean, I didn't recognise him, I didn't know it was him. 

771
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,079
But it was pretty... 

772
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:00,799
..pretty affecting, really. 

773
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,480
I mean, Roger and Dave cried. 

774
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,159
You know, this slim, elegant... 

775
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,960
..if bedraggled and dazed person that I had last seen, had turned 

776
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,880
rather balloon shaped, and had no eyebrows and not much hair, and... 

777
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,519
And there is the photograph of him in the studio at the time, 

778
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,440
and if you looked at Syd in early '67 

779
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,079
and Syd then, it was so different. 

780
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,840
It was a great loss and, you know... 

781
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,199
..imagining what he would have gone on to do is... 

782
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,759
Speculating on that, if you like, is... 

783
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,480
He could have become so great. 

784
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,920
It's actually kind of nice standing up here with these three guys 

785
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,680
after all these years. 

786
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:54,759
Standing to be counted with the rest of you. 

787
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,920
Anyway, we're doing this for everyone who's not here, 

788
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,119
but particularly, of course, for Syd. 

789
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,320
HE INTONES 

790
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,600
To me, it's about the most complete album, in some ways, 

791
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:22,279
and we all know how difficult it was to get to that point, 

792
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,600
and the problems we had. 

793
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:33,199
It's full of grief and anger, but also full of love. 

794
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:41,919
You've got to see beyond the grief and anger to the possibilities of love. 

795
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,440
APPLAUSE 

796
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,159
Thank you.
