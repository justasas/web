ones

639
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:55,489
okay there they are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two</font>

640
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:56,990
questions those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones i didn't</font>

643
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:03,108
you remember these last two questions

644
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,409
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't get around to the last</font>

645
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:05,409
time

646
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:16,289
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that but I read the</font>

647
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:19,139
book believe me I read that whole book

648
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:21,298
and the whole point is that this time I

649
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:26,818
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they weren't optional and</font>

650
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:28,829
there they are both both answers The

651
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:31,858
Rime of the Ancient Mariner was a poem

652
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:33,539
written by Robert Browning it was told

653
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:35,969

killed something Charles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Mary lamb</font>

658
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,048

659
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:52,469
Shakespeare in his Theatre to answer

660
00:55:49,048 --> 00:55:54,539
Part B Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet

661
00:55:52,469 --> 00:56:00,179
was about a boy and a girl who loved

662
00:55:54,539 --> 00:56:01,619
each other the girl was very nice the

663
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:04,289
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them only wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be together</font>

670
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:27,240
then I can add that on what I had and

671
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:29,308
I've got a 71 a little while ago Raymond

672
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:32,129
you said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had thought about all</font>

673
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:34,349
of this a lot you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagined just add it</font>

674
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:37,318
up and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else about what would</font>

675

684
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:57,289

687
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:13,279
wrong that's what studying is all about

688
00:57:08,298 --> 00:57:15,139
not the marks it's getting to know and

689
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,450
what's interesting and very encouraging

690
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:22,038
is that you were almost right on both of

691
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:25,088
these that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good considering that</font>

now there are a couple of very

778
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:46,650
interesting things about mr. Coleridge

779
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:49,950
he was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very famous man a very</font>

780
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:54,750
important man and he was worth studying

781
01:08:49,949 --> 01:08:58,529
and one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

782
01:08:54,750 --> 01:09:01,039
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is that Coleridge never</font>

783

finished school

784

01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:17,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">very troubled about things terribly</font>

friday teacher but to complete the

804
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:17,650
thought on mr. Coleridge he felt that

805
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:20,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were really helpless in trying to</font>

806
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:21,159
