00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,479
a man dead nearly 500 years is fates way

47
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,609
of showing me that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will find again</font>

terror that woman was John Vince's widow

79
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:29,168
before she died she became more coherent

80
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:32,019
begged for someone to write a letter to

81
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:36,009
her family in England here is the letter

82
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:38,789
dictated by that dying woman almost five

83
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,789
centuries ago

refused to abandon me does it give any

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">left alone but what about the discovery</font>

102
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:38,889
you spoke of what they find read on in

00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:54,969
this flame because he was murdered but

108
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,629
you are scientists do you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

109
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,530
all this seriously seriously come my boy

110
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,810
i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you how seriously coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

111
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:07,419
the laboratory where Holly and I have

done our life work in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

113
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:15,520
was as skeptical as you then Holly and I

114
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:18,550
years ago in this very room began our

115
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:24,939
efforts to reproduce John Vince's

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,810
certain element really exists an element

120

to preserve like yes 17 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

121

122
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:44,050
show him John yeah can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make out the</font>

sent it to the son she never saw again

127
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,330
it's also mysterious it doesn't make

00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:58,180
hence this thing's gold not an unknown

of volcanic character that's largely

156

guesswork isn't it no not if the family

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,230
what it's just a sort of legend what is

213
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,639
the legend a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago they believe</font>

214
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,680
a woman came out of the country that

215
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,689
lies far beyond the sugar what sort of

216
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,399
woman a white woman she told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that</font>

217
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,980
she had escaped from a strange place

218
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,879
strange and if a man finds the way there

219
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,149
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> will never die the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> catch in that is</font>

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:52,809
fire aflame anything you can connect

224
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:54,750
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this no I don't think so what's</font>

228
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:10,529
what lies beyond the sugar no you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

229
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:14,459

terrifically powerful unknown element

930
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:43,690

01:29:47,289 --> 01:29:53,680
out to destroy her after all Holly

934
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:59,440
perhaps there is no real flame of life I
