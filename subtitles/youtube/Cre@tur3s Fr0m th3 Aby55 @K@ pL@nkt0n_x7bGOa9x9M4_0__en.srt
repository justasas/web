oh fuck the boat<font color="#CCCCCC"> is flooded the lifeboat</font>

319
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:41,230
it's full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> water we have to bail it</font>

I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened here</font>

326
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is really wrong the lifeboat</font>

327
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:26,840
has a hole in it made by an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax there's a</font>

328

professor shirt in it what are you

329
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:36,800
planning on doing I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

330
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:45,559
they were researching on this ship we're

331
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:57,970
stuck here for the night anyway good it

332
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:57,969
works index marine biology presentation

333
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">margot this stuff is way out there it's</font>

334
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,130
way over mine

335
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,599
it's like

336
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:25,970
wild stuff

337
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,970
I'm sr stepped on something soft

338
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,798
I don't see anything

339
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,970
hey Mike look at this what the hell is

340
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it I accidentally touched his labor I</font>

341
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:51,199
get it now this is a control console for

a distant<font color="#CCCCCC"> teluk amber where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are they I</font>

343
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,309
believe they're in a bell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font>

344
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:58,069
of the sea along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the rest of the</font>

346
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:04,250
I have the feeling that the secret of

347
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:19,699
this ship is somehow tied to these

348
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:25,969
strange fish they found fish thought to

351
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:40,929
I mean

353
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,599
Oh

354
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:10,969
this is a real scientific lab not the

355
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:22,159
kind Bobby things I'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to refine</font>

they're carnivorous and live on plankton

carnivorous fish that live out of water

368
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,800
you know what that means

369
00:42:48,190 --> 00:43:01,900
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no house like Margaret we're</font>

370
00:42:52,150 --> 00:43:04,358
in the lab let's go oh my god here I'll

371

<font color="#CCCCCC">take care of come on out join you soon</font>

372
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:12,389
I'm still get it do you

see

382
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:47,440
let me see it but it's here

383
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:41,810
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see why this ship has no clue</font>

strike audio

385
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,050
ah

killed those monsters Margot damn I

393
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:55,399
forgot

427
00:53:40,230 --> 00:54:06,838
me out give me the key which one this

428
00:53:42,389 --> 00:54:10,199
one mutated species the erogenous Hamid

429
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:12,809

radically stimulated by inquisitive

433
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:27,450
minds plankton contaminated plankton

434
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:31,588
that's what's causing mutation professor

435
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:32,848
do listen the man who is below damn it

436
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:35,369
Margaret you almost gave me a heart

437
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:37,230
attack I'm sorry I didn't mean to

440
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,740
you to go below it's not safe in here no

441
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:48,000
way you stay I stay the fish you're dead

442
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:55,858
right sure stubborn how's your neck it

443
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,858
burns a little better much

444
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,858
Oh

445
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,150
fire in my veins

446
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:31,480
these fish went through a genetic

447
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:34,300
mutation caused by the plankton plankton

448
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:37,539
what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> plankton</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the major source</font>

449
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:40,750
of nutrient for fish it was contaminated

450
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">by radioactive waste dumped by a ship in</font>

451
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,949
this area it contaminate the bottom of

00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,050
this part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sea contaminated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

453
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:49,750
plankton eaten by the fish and so they

454
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:52,120
became contaminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> that explains their</font>

455
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,099
strange properties these fish<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

456
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,859
mutants creatures which because that's

457
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:58,389
incredible strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vitality like</font>

458
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:02,079
that damn fish that attacked you

459
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:04,239
professor do listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> after having fished</font>

460
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,429
them and put them under glass thought

461
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:08,679
they were dead evidently one of them

462
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:12,519
wasn't and ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up killing the whole</font>

463
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:15,609
crew somehow it affected him here it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

464
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:20,289
after every discovery the professor put

465
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:22,990
them into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory bank it's</font>

466
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:25,329
horrendous I'm sure it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in one of</font>

467
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:27,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">the containers this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last animal</font>

468
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:29,440
recorded by the professor you remember

469
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:32,349
the broken container you mean it was

470
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,639
that thing who I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and the most</font>

471
