protecting what's that supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

790
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:19,700
you're removing my freedoms my rights

791
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:23,179
and my heritage as a Christian America

792
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:25,278
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the separation of</font>

00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:37,920

anti-american cause

799
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:50,730

all my fight is it about colored lights

1005
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:25,850
or a tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the city square my fight is</font>

1006
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:28,309
about freedom and taking back what has

it is time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stood up for what they</font>

1011
01:12:37,969 --> 01:12:44,119
died for but what we believe in our

1012
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:50,060
rights are being destroyed perhaps

1013
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:52,019
forever but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see we're letting</font>

they're wondering if they died in vain

1029
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:52,380
do we dare diminish their sacrifice by

1030
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:55,590
our silence well if your answer is no

1031
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:58,529
