heard of Plato's cave the night club

84
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,908
it's this idea that we're all sitting in

85
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,158
a cave staring at the shadows on a wall

86
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:41,438

the Somalian pirates and the Indian

168
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,509
Ocean learning to play it wouldn't bring
