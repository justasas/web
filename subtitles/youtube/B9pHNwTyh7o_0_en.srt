17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,868
just answer the phone no matter what our
it is and not make your own decisions

yeah

217
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,509

I've got all the time in the world

219
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,640

army and my girlfriend's upset because I

00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:24,388
yeah

242
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:48,609

yeah

249
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,190
yeah

250
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,210
yeah

251
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,779
yeah

252
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,779
ok

253
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:15,629
yeah

254
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,799
yeah

255
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:20,798
yeah

256
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:56,710
yeah

257
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,710
yeah

258
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,859
too late

259
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:07,859
why don't you listen to me

260
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,750
yeah

261
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:28,789
what's going on

262
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,099
thank you

263
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:44,099
yeah

264
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:08,610
oh if you only knew what you just did

265
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,720
I don't understand what just happened

266
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,120
the wall I tried to warn you those
creatures fault

267
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,940
a tried all my work

268
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,309
30 years I've been trying to prevent
this from happening to prevent one from

269
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:30,569
happening

270
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:36,119
those creatures why do you think i spent
the last 30 years of my life here

271
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:44,609
I was keeping them from escaping and i
was young i began to work here in the

272
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,609
studio was busy and prosperous

273
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:53,269
but always remember the night that it
happened

274
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:54,690
yeah

275
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,590
sleep

276
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:58,589
it was having anyone around

277
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,190
did you know it was first

278
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,009
it's all so fast

279
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:09,779
flashing light and some explosion
stepped out to see what it was

280
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,470
one else there except for me

281
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,339
it was right in the middle of the line

282
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:21,689
- daytime

283
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,690
it probably would have been questioned
all the traffic

284
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,610
I just stared at it for a long time

285
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:31,609
I didn't know what to make of it

286
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,250
and then suddenly

287
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,890
and I'll top the district in this swim

288
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,360
creature government

289
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,459
I looked around

290
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,860
stared right at me

291
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:48,819
imagine

292
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:52,019
just give watching

293
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,440
first

294
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,440
for me I'd known what lay ahead

295
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,548
but I still don't understand

296
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,878
I let the creatures live on a lot

297
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:12,849
it was my secret and then I learned of
the power they had I still don't know of

298
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,319
a fever

299
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:21,579
doing good for people or not they slowly
began to destroy everyone a lot

300
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:28,000
they would find a person tap into his
brain and create his wildest fantasy

301
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,220
it seemed harmless at first I mean
watching everyone around me becoming

302
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:40,210
rich famous but the most people what
they really want in life can be very

303
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,590
dangerous

304
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:47,079
in fact the creatures want up destroying
everyone everyone who came in contact

305
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:55,178
with the loose in the city now but you
could warn everyone did listen to your

306
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:56,649
story

307
00:32:56,648 --> 00:33:02,709
what no one will give me 30 years ago I
went straight to the head of the studio

308
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,179
and try to explain it

309
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:07,240
he didn't believe me no one did

310
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,388
just watched helplessly as people around
me were destroyed one by one and what

311
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:16,579
can we do

312
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:20,869
I to order to catch up with him now but
you might still have a chance

313
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:24,679
there aren't very many of them but they
move quickly

314
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:29,298
just remember they're attracted to
bright lights

315
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:35,450
that's how you can find them watch
everyone around you in person begins to

316
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,038
back strangely it means that one of the
creatures have attacked into his mind

317
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:43,369
when this happens the creature is never
far away

318
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:47,750
find it and kill it before it's too late
because when the creature dies the

319
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:53,659
fantasy ends in the victim is safe now
remember they're only attracted to

320
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,278
bright light

321
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:01,099
that's how you find them but you must
destroy them or before dawn because once

322
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,658
it's daylight it's too late

323
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,260
but you'll never be able to stop them

324
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,260
yeah

325
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,260
yeah

326
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,570
yeah

327
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,739
yeah

328
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,659
yeah

329
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,559
yeah

330
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:24,449
yeah

331
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,019
what

332
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:32,690
yeah

333
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,300
here

334
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
maybe circling the block

335
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,550
I thought you might be told up thanks a
lot

336
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,260
I thought I heard this one before

337
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,780
so did I

338
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,269

he's just looking for a place to park
don't you go back in the house there's

00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,159
plenty of parking in front

341
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,629
maybe it wasn't his . look I'm positive
it was maybe the police just pulled them

342
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,010
