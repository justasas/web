be strong if she can make it to
Christmas

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,840
Emery is very ill the doctor system
unless she gets better in a few days

31
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,310
by Christmas at the latest we may lose
her

32
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,379
what what will make her better the
doctor says she has to want to get

33
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,009
better

34
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:03,620
the trouble is she's been so weak for so
long that he's afraid she's given up but

35
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,580
isn't there some kind of medicine or
something we can give her the most

36
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,410
important medicine has to come from
inside Emily Elizabeth herself Landon

37
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,829
we've done all we can do the rest is up
to her

38
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,459
we need to stick together as a family

39
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:27,349

you're brave boy land and we all have to

40

41
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,900
it might take a miracle for Emily
Elizabeth to get better but miracles can

42
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,409
happen any time especially at Christmas

43
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,310
that's right hold a good thought for
every Elizabeth

as electro smile

254
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,769
well it seems that during the night the
evil charlatan who ruled everywhere in

255
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:03,720
the land except for princess electric
magical kingdom decided that he wanted

256
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,610
to rule her land -

257
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:11,969
and so when everyone was asleep he crept
past the palace guards and stole into

258
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,769
Princess electric been

259
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:18,690
and with one quick awful movement
Charlotte she took the smile right off

260
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,940
the sleeping princess his face want to
tighten to a little black box

261
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,369
by who charlatans and why do you want to
stay with smile with privacy leg drop

262
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:33,720
well Justice Snowden had told them

263
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,450
charlatan was the word of young he moved
the entire land forcing children to

264
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,850
bring Brandi rainbows presence and
goodies with evil York factories they

265
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:49,439

around took them into his yuck factories

266
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,440
where the rainbows and stuff were turned

267
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:56,349

little like glass

283
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:22,058
just as I thought of fears interfering
with a magic

284
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:27,609
that's what fear does it always seems
bigger than anything even bigger than

285
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,888
one's own magical powers

286
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:38,109

sweat the google push you

288

nonsense you better hurry and need all
the help I can get

290
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:58,429
come on memory Elizabeth this is the
time for action not questions are

291
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,429
pushing it

292
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:05,808
yeah

293
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:15,940
I hold I stared

294
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,190
well who isn't we can't delay we must
get the Charlatans lab before he

295
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,070
destroys the princess smile for ever

296
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:28,808
where is it land across limp and lake

297
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,990
okay well I guess we'd better start
walking around the lake walk around

298
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,990
we'll never make it in time look

299
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,650
it's way too cold to swim how we gonna
get across

300
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,730
perhaps Emery Elizabeth will come up
with an idea

301
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,950
no expecting a stupid wheelchair how can
I possibly help

302
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,759
I don't know anymore Elizabeth call it a
hunch

303
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,900
and usually pretty right about my
hunches

304
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,850
I just think that if you stop feeling
sorry for yourself for a minute

305
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:19,399
you figure out exactly what to do what
you're supposed to be smart way around

306
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,300
here aren't you

307
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:26,119
there's a time for questions and
Elizabeth and the time for i know we

308
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,429
know a time for action

309
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,430
let me shake

310
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:40,910
what is it do you have an idea I'm not
sure maybe I'm sure what is it

311
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:47,060
well I was just thinking about a nice
cold glass of pink lemonade an entire

312
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:52,159
kingdom is doomed in your Thursday think
she's onto something here

313
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,680
yeah something pretty silly and you know
how when you put the ice cubes in the

314
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,680
glass and port lemonade guess to float
to the top

315
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,430
oh great now she has to have ice in your
drink

316
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,269
how would a straw to Emory Shh

317
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:15,769
go on every Elizabeth well I was just
wondering if I said she was float

318
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:20,119
maybe just maybe you're drunk

319
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,119
that's it that's your idea

320
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,179
you were right bring silly

321
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,540
so much for my hunches come on let's
start walking

322
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:36,548
no wing stupid idea brilliant idea

323
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:40,269
brilliant I think not creative

324
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:44,230
ok inventive I grant you but brilliant

325
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,970
obviously she is not taking into account
that i cannot swim

326
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:56,798
nevermind swimming can you float I guess
it's really only one way to find out

327
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,798
give me a little push will you

328
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,869
