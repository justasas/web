1
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:02,000
Sudan...Africa...

2
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:04,502
A strange place to me,

3
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,671
Unknown language...unknown people...

4
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,432
Having been a fisherman all my life,
it's not easy to learn new job.

5
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:23,937
I found a good friend there.

6
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,063
His name is Swamy.

7
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:26,855
Like my Chinna!

8
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,361
I hated this job but still I did.

9
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:44,372
I separated fish from sea,
may be that was a sin,

10
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,709
life too me away from sea.

11
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:52,379
Oh no! Why do you always talk
about water, sea and fishes?

12
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,465
What's so great about your place!

13
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:55,883
Pani!

14
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,470
People back in my village
too work in fields.

15
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,515
This is different Pani.

16
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:05,808
You can't understand.

17
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:11,813
Buddy, the best thing I learnt
from you is smoking cigars.

18
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,981
Very good.

19
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,901
Isn't it great?
That's special from my place.

20
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:20,404
My only comfort is talking
to Pani once in week.

21
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:23,407
I'm happy all that day.

22
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,492
I'll sleep peacefully.

23
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:33,668
Slowly I got used to the place
and the people there.

24
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:36,002
All were like me, right?

25
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,007
2 years!

26
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,343
Somehow went by!

27
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:48,223
I'm going back home.

28
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:50,432
I'm going to meet my Pani.

29
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,352
I'll sleep in the lap of Mother Sea.

30
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,995
How are you, Pani?

31
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,206
How about you?

32
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,041
Now I feel good!

33
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:22,378
Just one more week to go, Maria!

34
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:26,548
Two years went past somehow.

35
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:29,468
But now a week appears much longer.

36
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:33,305
You said it and I didn't, that's all.

37
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,141
I'm coming Pani!

38
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,935
Back to sea breeze,

39
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,810
salt water,

40
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:41,896
and you in my arms.

41
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:50,822
First thing, I want to have is delicious
spicy gravy and rice prepared by you.

42
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:53,490
Sure.

43
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,826
Did you get my last letter?

44
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:03,083
Got your 53rd letter...
and...got that also!

45
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,753
Hey, don't send me anymore!

46
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:10,923
Rest in person.

47
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,509
Is it?

48
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,853
Yesupadam has announced to every person
in the village about our wedding.

49
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,524
The only thing left is
to stitch your suit.

50
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:34,694
Tell Yesupadam my size has changed
in the last two years.

51
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,614
Let's get it done when I am back.

52
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:39,115
I hope you are in the
size I can hug, right?

53
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,285
What?

54
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,703
I am running out of change.

55
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,788
I need to get back to work.

56
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,624
Shall I go?

57
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,292
Shall I?

58
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:57,216
Listen Maria, come back safely!

59
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,133
Okay, see you.

60
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,935
What is he saying?
- He thinks this is Dubai.

61
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,603
Hey! This is not Dubai!
This is Africa!

62
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,480
We have shed our blood
for two years.

63
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:02,692
He has just arrived.
He will know as days go by.

64
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:10,199
Hey Bald man, play some Telugu song.

65
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,950
Hey uncle, play Hindi song,

66
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,868
What Hindi song?

67
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,204
You made Ravan with Shahrukh
competing with us,

68
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,290
it flopped, right?
Why do you still insist on Hindi songs?

69
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,918
A heart is sprouting inside iron...

70
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:26,171
It is seeking kiss in love...

71
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,299
Madrasi in Dharavi...I see you in Africa...
find them everywhere.

72
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,509
Shut up, you nasty!

73
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,220
You're with us unable to find
job anywhere, why still separate us?

74
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:36,556
Sridevi is from South,
Hema Malini is from South,

75
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,643
Silk Smitha is from South.
A.R.Rahman is from South.

76
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,852
So is Sachin Tendulkar.

77
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,355
Sorry! Tongue slip.

78
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:46,524
Maria, isn't our place
foreign city to this place?

79
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:47,649
Will you keep shut?

80
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:51,153
Keeping shut always has
made it useless.

81
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,657
Your life is set,
you'll get married soon.

82
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:57,909
You're feeling so much
for 2 years seeing a photo.

83
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:02,663
But see, I'm feeling so much
for 4 girls in on photo.

84
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,749
But still unable to trap even one!

85
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,253
No use if you have the feeling,
it must come from that side too.

86
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,424
My name is Maria.

87
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,344
Maria means
the man who never dies!

88
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,139
As my name suggests…
I was arrogant and full of pride.

89
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:25,017
Instead of salty air,
I got dust storm.

90
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:27,060
Instead of dry fish,
I got tasteless meal.

91
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,689
All my arrogance disappeared.

92
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:33,442
There I was the king...
King of the sea.

93
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,841
By catching the Tiger shark
Maria has brought pride to place.

94
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:02,468
What his late father could not
20 years ago he did it now.

95
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,596
You are the King of the sea.

96
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:06,639
You've kept your father's pride!

97
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,479
Youth is swinging...

98
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,817
Swinging amidst lashing waves...

99
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:38,501
It's a garland of flowers...

100
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,586
It has come seeking you...

101
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,672
Oh my golden girl...

102
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,764
Come my, dear...

103
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,137
The golden girl gave her
beauty to me...

104
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:39,390
She hid more beauty under her wings...

105
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:43,144
She gives kiss for kiss...

106
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:47,481
When you're with me smiling
time flies away...

107
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,235
My cuckoo...my melody...
my golden girl...

108
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:55,239
My moon...my jasmine...
my golden girl...

109
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:59,158
My golden girl fills my life...

110
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:18,468
Looks like you've stolen everything, Maria!

111
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,761
Leave something for us too!

112
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,889
Didn't find anyone else to pick up fight?

113
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:25,265
Mind your work.

114
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:30,771
He's the only guy refusing
to come to my way!

115
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,332
In cool eyes...

116
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,626
Under cool moonlight...

117
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,211
One the wings of romance...

118
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,297
Heart is having hiccups...

119
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:06,596
Kiss me passionately on my cheeks...

120
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:10,932
Make a bed of honey and love for me...

121
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,502
Okay, come abroad.

122
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:50,470
You're the lone man who rocks with the
spear fishing technique learnt over years.

123
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:54,514
Buddy risks life to catch fish and
we enjoy eating food and drinking!

124
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:55,932
I'm hungry, open the lunch box.

125
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:58,684
Take this, buddy.

126
00:13:58,851 --> 00:13:59,769
He gives only cooked rice.

127
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,855
This is mixed with love and wish.

128
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:05,150
Is Maria yearning for it?

129
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,443
Look, he always tells about you to Pani.

130
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,697
He's delivering dialogue
about love and wish here.

131
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,450
If he likes, he won't leave
without having it.

132
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:16,951
If Maria doesn't like,
he'll never go after it.

133
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,787
I too know that.

134
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:23,625
Like NTR and Savithri...
like ANR and Jamuna...

135
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,918
She's the perfect match for him like them.

136
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,212
Buddy, shall I tell you a thing?
- Why not two?

137
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,340
Buddy, I'm serious.
- Go ahead.

138
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:35,135
What you don’t expect may never happen,
but what you expect will surely happen.

139
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:38,471
Are you giving counter punch to mine?
I'll kick on your pot belly.

140
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,889
If you kick on my belly...

141
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,517
Nothing happened till now and
it'll not happen in future too.

142
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,394
Got it? Shut up and mind your work.

143
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,650
I promised her to bring him
to church tomorrow.

144
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,903
If I don't take him, she'll kill me.

145
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:58,573
If you become a hurdle,
she'll poison your food too.

146
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,869
If he comes to know about this,
he'll kill us.

147
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,663
What is that murmur?
- Nothing, he keeps on blabbering.

148
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:22,234
Why did you insist I must come here
as if it is very important?

149
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:25,903
Church...God...
- To wash off the sins committed by us.

150
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:28,406
The only sin I've committed
is meeting you.

151
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,490
Nothing else.

152
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:32,826
Where's Das?

153
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,372
Where is Das?

154
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,875
He would've got drunk and
playing cards somewhere.

155
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,336
We must reform him!

156
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,589
What's this Chinna?
Strange to see you in church.

157
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,423
Why not ask him directly?

158
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,341
Will you keep shut?

159
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,094
You came here to see me, right?

160
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:54,429
Did you feel like that?

161
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:55,680
He brought me here.

162
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,890
Then, why did keep on staring at me?

163
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,350
Staring at you?

164
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,186
I was watching the girls with you.

165
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,690
Had you seen other girls,
I would've cut you to pieces.

166
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:06,774
You know that, right?

167
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,111
Why are you hitting him?
Look at me!

168
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:14,490
What you don’t expect may never happen!

169
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,035
What you expect will surely happen!

170
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,620
May be he got it!

171
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,499
Why do you hide your feelings?

172
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,168
Look dear...

173
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,837
Don't play with me about
inner and outer feelings.

174
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:33,466
Before it is dark, go home carefully.

175
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:34,383
Go.

176
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,051
How long will you escape from me?

177
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:41,390
Hey...look at me!

178
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:45,727
I saw it in your eyes now...

179
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:51,606
Some day you will be mine!

180
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:54,317
Bye.

181
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:03,243
Looks like she'll trap you, buddy.

182
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,247
How is it possible?
If she thinks so, is it okay?

183
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:09,499
Nobody can trap you so easily, buddy.

184
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:10,875
Who Maria is!

185
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,418
Why is he looking angrily at me?

186
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,593
Hi Pani! How do you do?

187
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,260
Long time no see.

188
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,096
Are you returning from church?

189
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:28,473
I don't feel like talking
to any girl in this village.

190
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,643
But I don't know why with you...

191
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,688
I'm going on talking to you
but you're not responding at all.

192
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:38,525
You must talk to me next time
as I talked to you now.

193
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:48,033
Brother, if you like any girl,
either you take her as concubine,

194
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,576
or else devastate,

195
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,871
but why are you hesitating about Pani?

196
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,625
All other women are like losing hair.
But Pani is my life.

197
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,377
I must touch only after
making her my wife.

198
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:01,296
That's why I'm patient.

199
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,681
I'll tell how to trap him.

200
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,434
If mach remains inside box,
can it light fire?

201
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,436
It won't light fire.

202
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:21,480
Fire is lighted only when stick
is rubbed with the box.

203
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:22,648
,Got it now?

204
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,240
How much we owe to Dosa Punnamma's?

205
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:33,409
Rs.100.

206
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:35,243
Let's clear it today.

207
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,289
Who is Joseph? Never seen him here.

208
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,750
He's new to this area, buddy.

209
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,918
He took loan and refusing to repay.

210
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,588
Where did you get money to give loans?

211
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:49,507
I can't believe it.

212
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,265
Why did you back off?
- Nothing, buddy.

213
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,687
How far still?
- Near by...next street.

214
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,480
I don't know to which street
I must take him now.

215
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:08,440
He's killing me with questions.

216
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,734
Buddy, next street.

217
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,278
Just now you said this street.

218
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,196
I'm telling the same thing again, buddy.

219
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,077
I'll tell that again, buddy.

220
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:23,455
Come.

221
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:00,529
What?

222
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,073
Dreaming about me hugging her!

223
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,162
If you act like a pimp again,
I'll kill you.

224
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:09,329
Got it?

225
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:22,259
You talked about match box and stick,
he's dumb like a mud doll.

226
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,928
I'll puncture your back.

227
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:33,560
Buddy!

228
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:34,728
Come here.

229
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,020
Coming, buddy.

230
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,232
The slap I got morning
is still hurting me.

231
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,941
Don't know what he's up to now?
- Come.

232
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,778
Why did you call me, buddy?

233
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:47,698
Buddy...that is...
- Tell me, what's it, buddy?

234
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:49,282
Nothing...

235
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,701
Buddy, my button!

236
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,953
That is...

237
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:56,373
Tell me now.

238
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,375
That's it.

239
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,751
That is...

240
00:22:01,502 --> 00:22:02,378
It came..

241
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:03,837
What has come?

242
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,548
That thing...

243
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:09,134
It has come...on her...

244
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,386
Buddy! I knew!

245
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:12,971
You will get it.

246
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:14,639
Hold your head high.

247
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:16,391
I feel shy.

248
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:22,897
Buddy...will you do me a favour?

249
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:24,149
Tell me, buddy.

250
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,736
I want to meet her.
- Who?

251
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,406
Tell me.

252
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,411
I must see her...

253
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:39,495
That's all?
I'll get her right now.

254
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:43,250
Buddy, not now.

255
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,170
She makes fantastic gravy and rice,

256
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:51,673
will you ask her to come here with it?

257
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,344
Look, how he's blushing!

258
00:22:56,636 --> 00:23:00,807
Sister! It has worked!

259
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:04,769
Sister! It has worked!

260
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:12,817
My son never asked till now,
he asked me to get food for him.

261
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:15,028
I don't see him here.

262
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:19,031
He'll come.

263
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:21,283
I'll leave it here.

264
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:22,493
He'll come and have it.

265
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,453
He told me to come here, right?

266
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:25,663
Yes.

267
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,832
Would he come here?
- Why did she come here?

268
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,125
Where else would he go?

269
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,045
She too has brought food.
- Buddy!

270
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:34,171
Buddy!

271
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,840
He asked me to come here, right?
Why hasn't he turned up yet?

272
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:38,467
Let him come at anytime,
please sit here.

273
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:42,721
How was he today morning?

274
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:45,682
Have you started it again?

275
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:47,349
It's 50th time now.

276
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:48,977
Tell me, this is that last time.

277
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,189
When he came out,
the way he was feeling shy...

278
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,941
Never seen him like that, trust me.

279
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:59,235
Infact I too felt embarrassed,
think about it yourself.

280
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:00,319
Then?

281
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,365
He hung his head feeling shy
thinking about you.

282
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:09,703
Why hasn't he come yet?

283
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:11,705
He'll come...wait.

284
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,415
He must come from home, right?

285
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,669
That old woman is there, right?
She'll not even sleep.

286
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:20,212
She keeps vigil on him like a ghost
fearing some girl may kidnap him.

287
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,091
I must gouge out her eyes with ladle.

288
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,387
She thinks the food counter
is some big star hotel.

289
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:32,432
Only I know the pain of people
eating in her food counter.

290
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:33,933
I'll take you to task.

291
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:35,311
Be patient.

292
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,895
This will carry on few more days only.

293
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:43,108
As soon as I go to that home,
I'll shut down the food counter immediately.

294
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,863
Do that first, at least for this
I'll unite you with him.

295
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:53,952
Keep watching the scene, the old woman must
come wagging like dog for food after me.

296
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,120
I'll hit you with slippers.
How dare you talk like that!

297
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,122
Bloody girl!

298
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:01,209
My son knows about you,
that's why he told me to bring food for him.

299
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,877
Come...come...
- Stop...stop...

300
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,963
Stop, you girl.

301
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,673
Stop...stop...

302
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,717
How dare you try to trap my son!

303
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,471
If you look at my son,
I'll gouge out your eyes!

304
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:14,137
Get lost!

305
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:21,103
Buddy..it seems he'll cheat me
into going to church,

306
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,939
and take me around the streets
for collecting a never given loan,

307
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:28,776
and imagine Pani as his sister
like in the film 'Raktha Sambandham'.

308
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,155
Hey buffalo! You won't anything
silly like this again, right?

309
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,826
Nephew! Can I ask you a question?

310
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:41,663
Why not ask 5 or 6?

311
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:44,249
I'm serious, why are you doing comedy?

312
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:45,500
Don't get angry.

313
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,999
Come on, ask me.

314
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:52,298
That girl is yearning to be
yours since childhood.

315
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,174
Why are you rejecting her?

316
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,641
You've grown old but not wise.

317
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,940
Ever since my father went to sea
with Yesupadam and died,

318
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:13,067
Seal has been accusing them of it,

319
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,860
6how can she accept this girl?

320
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:21,199
Even if I go against her and marry her,
can she live happily there?

321
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:24,411
Let's allow them be happy like that.

322
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,624
Sea is there for all my life.

323
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:34,211
If you want to share drinks
happily, do join me.

324
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:36,462
If you want to talk about this,
then go to bed silently.

325
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,423
Got it?

326
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:40,759
I'm scared you may hit me!

327
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:41,884
Will you hit me?

328
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:43,970
Go to sleep.

329
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,621
Special news bulletin about weather…

330
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:17,418
Fishermen are advised not to venture
into sea for 48 hours...

331
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,545
It seems your man has gone to sea.

332
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,089
Does he have sense?

333
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,426
Are you up?

334
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,053
What brings you here in so heavy rain?

335
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:35,392
Heavy winds and rains, yet he ventured
into sea with his friends.

336
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:36,601
What are you saying?

337
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,895
Inform Yesupadam about it.

338
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:41,856
Sir...

339
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,794
Where you my King?

340
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:13,844
Dusk has fallen...

341
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:37,990
The food has gone cold...

342
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:49,669
My heart is sinking...

343
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:54,673
If you're with me...

344
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:01,054
The sky will be bright...

345
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:04,348
Today you're not with me...

346
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:15,358
My heart is broken...
heart is broken...

347
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:22,240
What am I to do, my King?

348
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:27,954
I'm aimless...

349
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:33,584
Why are you sitting distraught here?

350
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,920
Missing fishermen have returned safely.

351
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:38,463
Boat got damaged, that's all.

352
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:49,890
Lost honour, buddy.

353
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:53,560
Damaged Yesupadam's boat.

354
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:56,230
Entire village saw this, buddy.

355
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:04,612
Buddy...buddy...

356
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,491
Lost honour, right?

357
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,414
Don't you dare come with me again!

358
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:17,499
Go alone.

359
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:24,506
Lost honour...
Maria is shameless man, right?

360
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:26,508
I don't have any honour, right?

361
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:40,562
You went away as you like...

362
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:43,355
I almost died waiting for your return.

363
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:46,275
You know there's cyclone,
why did you enter sea?

364
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,117
Go away silently.

365
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:01,288
What do you think of yourself?

366
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:03,123
I don't think of anything.

367
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:07,670
What?

368
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:09,922
Love?

369
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:12,882
Empty ground!

370
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:15,134
Mind your work.

371
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:23,727
You're alive, right?

372
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,605
I've seen you, right?

373
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:30,357
Get lost.

374
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:31,567
Go away.

375
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,359
Get lost!

376
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,860
Got match stick?

377
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:26,618
Got match stick?
- No.

378
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:33,624
What?

379
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,125
Got match stick?

380
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,169
Got it.

381
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:54,768
Take match box.
He'll never reform.

382
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,978
You carry on.

383
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,688
Found him for free.

384
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:19,458
Sea and love...it's always new
any number of times you see.

385
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,584
What do you say?

386
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,046
Hey old man!
Looks like you're in mood for it.

387
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,423
I'm telling you with my experience.

388
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,800
Experience?

389
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,678
If you've experience,
how is that you're a bachelor?

390
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:37,682
Love is heart must always hit
the coast like waves.

391
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,433
That will give you strength.

392
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,939
For a man who wishes to succeed,
a woman must be there in his life.

393
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,942
That's okay,
who is the woman in your life?

394
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:51,903
Buddy! Did you hear the old man?

395
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,531
It seems a woman must be
there in a man's life.

396
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:56,200
Stop it.

397
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:16,969
My dear new couple...in the presence
of Lord and friends...

398
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,802
Pani! Girls of your age are getting married,
when are you getting married?

399
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:52,556
Just say okay, let's marry immediately.

400
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:19,706
Don't you know whose bike that is?

401
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:20,749
Move.

402
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:28,172
If you're feeling so itchy,
rub yourself into some thorny bush.

403
00:36:28,463 --> 00:36:30,423
Why are you rubbing ladies' slippers?

404
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,519
If say loudly what I said now,
people would laugh at you,

405
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:46,439
so, what you will do in future is,

406
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,610
if you come to church,
don't misbehave with girls,

407
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,777
behave properly!

408
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:20,679
What bothers you if he
touches Pani's slippers?

409
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:24,432
You like her so much,
why do you hide it?

410
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:26,434
You love Pani, buddy.

411
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:31,062
You'll get the sick instead of him.

412
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:34,900
This is what you get for telling truth.

413
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:50,080
Stop Pani.

414
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,499
Please listen to me.

415
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:53,625
Wait a minute, Pani.
- What's it?

416
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:56,711
Maria...
- Why? Forget it.

417
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:57,463
Stop.

418
00:37:58,005 --> 00:37:58,922
I don't want this trouble anymore.

419
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:00,715
Please listen to me.

420
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:03,677
What?

421
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,677
Listen to me,

422
00:38:05,844 --> 00:38:09,681
I'm happy with choir singing,
going to church and offering prayers.

423
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:12,101
He told there's nothing
in him for me, right?

424
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:12,976
Why again?

425
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:16,562
No, only I know how much he loves you.

426
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,025
Yes...would anyone hit the girl he loves?

427
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:23,195
Listen to me.
He grew up like that.

428
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:28,865
He loves you, that's why he had a fight
with dark man for touching your slippers.

429
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:30,034
Do you know that?

430
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:36,874
What did you say?

431
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,751
Go, ask him.

432
00:38:58,893 --> 00:38:59,769
I saw you, right?

433
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:02,981
You're alive, right?

434
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,242
You like her so much,
why do you hide it?

435
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:18,996
You love Pani.

436
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,253
For a man who wishes to succeed,
a woman must be there in his life.

437
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,682
Some day you will be mine.

438
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:28,489
Why so late?

439
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,449
I had to prepare food.

440
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:35,704
Though I warn my heart refuses to listen...

441
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:39,791
Even in dream I think about you only...

442
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:40,876
What?

443
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,631
Annagaru's romance is rocking,
he's sensational.

444
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:51,427
There's power in first love...

445
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:55,722
And you know that well...

446
00:41:55,931 --> 00:42:02,896
Dreams are murmuring...
My heart is swinging...

447
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,230
Isn't it sensational, buddy?

448
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,485
Buddy...buddy...

449
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,694
Take it.

450
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:25,666
The time girl has come seeking me...

451
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,001
When she stands away from me...

452
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:44,768
Without your order
I can't even take breathe...

453
00:42:57,237 --> 00:43:00,449
Hey Yesupadam! Come out!

454
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:05,119
My son is NTR but
your daughter is not Savithri.

455
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:10,790
If you've shame and shy, come out.

456
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:14,753
Hey little devil!

457
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,963
Didn't you find any other man in town?

458
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,757
Did you find my only my son?

459
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:19,800
Come out I say!

460
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:22,510
What? Why are you going overboard?

461
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:25,889
If I come to know if you're
after my son or talk to him,

462
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:28,640
I'll throw you into sea, mind it.

463
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,891
Why are you staring at me?

464
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:31,644
Why are you all watching fun?

465
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:34,313
Fight between daughter-in-law
and mother-in-law is common.

466
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,105
Isn't it?

467
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:38,817
I'll cut your tongue.

468
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,818
Who is your mother-in-law?

469
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,862
Why are you asking as if you don't know?

470
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:43,655
You!

471
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:46,074
Have you gone that far?

472
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,413
If you enter my home as daughter-in-law,
I'll cut your legs.

473
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:56,000
Go now, let's think about that
after marriage.

474
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,126
Are you planning marriage also?

475
00:43:58,293 --> 00:44:00,671
Let me see, how you'll marry him!

476
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:04,548
I know who is responsible for this,
let Maria come.

477
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:08,219
Is any record dance going
here to watch? Go away.

478
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:09,262
Get lost.

479
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:13,014
Go...have come to watch...go away.

480
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:15,683
Today, he's dead in my hands.

481
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:35,952
Love story between a famous
film star and...

482
00:44:40,164 --> 00:44:41,958
What are you doing here?

483
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:47,297
If there's not a woman in house,
did you see how shabby the home is?

484
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:48,464
Don't you wash clothes?

485
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,550
If Seal sees you, you're gone.
Go.

486
00:44:52,217 --> 00:44:55,971
Your name is Maria,
you're afraid of Seal.

487
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:59,223
She'll wake up entire village.
What am I to do now?

488
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:01,518
She has already done it.

489
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:04,228
Announcement is also over.

490
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:07,398
What do you want?

491
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:11,652
Will you give whatever I ask?

492
00:45:13,528 --> 00:45:16,030
It depends on what you ask...

493
00:45:16,197 --> 00:45:17,449
What if you ask more...

494
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,577
Would I ask for a child?

495
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,581
You may ask that also.

496
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:25,789
Go.

497
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,710
Shall I go?

498
00:45:33,755 --> 00:45:34,797
Shall I go?

499
00:45:52,856 --> 00:45:54,608
You said empty ground.

500
00:45:57,652 --> 00:45:59,153
You own it now, right?

501
00:45:59,695 --> 00:46:00,404
Go.

502
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:30,974
Why don't you be with me
for some more time?

503
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:35,645
Why are you leaving urgently?

504
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:03,922
Before our talk drop like rain
and hearts sprout out...

505
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:08,467
Please don't go away from me...

506
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:20,354
If you vanish like lightning,
I'll remain in darkness...

507
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:56,803
With an unseen net,
you trapped my heart...

508
00:47:56,969 --> 00:48:07,020
Blowing unheard whistle,
you made my heart to tremble...

509
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:12,485
Come to me like a wave...

510
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:17,697
Shall I become a bangle on your hand?

511
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:23,244
Late is nectar...
learn to be patient...

512
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:29,583
Nectar is bitter and
your word is sweet...

513
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:36,506
You've to wait for some more time...

514
00:48:36,673 --> 00:48:41,010
What's so urgent for you?

515
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:15,708
Why are you wearing these
clothes for fishing?

516
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:16,710
Are you not coming for fishing?

517
00:49:16,876 --> 00:49:18,753
I told you to go alone, right?
Go.

518
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,963
That's it, why would you need us now?

519
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:21,757
Carry on.

520
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:31,640
I'll wait for you like the
ever lasting sea water...

521
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:42,483
The anger on my face is
unknown hurdle for you...

522
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:48,071
Even in salty winds,
I can taste sweetness...

523
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,077
Let's cover ourselves with
the warmth of hot wind...

524
00:49:53,244 --> 00:49:58,582
The fish smell on your body is
fragrance of flowers to me in my arms...

525
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:05,504
Talk all the night and
hunt me with your words...

526
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:33,572
You're the eyelid of my eyes…
You're the father of my kids...

527
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,452
Our kids must sing and
dance like waves...

528
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:46,209
Your words will come true...
you and me would we...

529
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,546
Let's drown ourselves
in the sea of love...

530
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:54,842
Why are you surprized?

531
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:58,344
If we've come to your house
seeking girl, you must be very lucky.

532
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:01,306
My elder brother
who refused to marry till now,

533
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:05,393
today he wants to marry
only Pani no one else.

534
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,985
How long will you ponder, Yesupadam?

535
00:51:16,362 --> 00:51:20,032
You took loan from me years ago.
I didn't care about it.

536
00:51:20,197 --> 00:51:22,701
4Keep it as gift and give your
daughter in marriage to me.

537
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:25,661
Marriage for money!

538
00:51:25,994 --> 00:51:29,623
Sister insisted, so I came
seeking hand traditionally.

539
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,584
If not I would've kidnapped her.

540
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:54,355
What's wrong with him?

541
00:52:03,445 --> 00:52:09,493
Okay...just because Chinna went away...

542
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:17,291
You always hit only me.

543
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:20,294
I can hit only you.
Who else can I hit?

544
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:22,756
Okay, don't get angry.

545
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,469
I should've killed and
thrown your body in sea.

546
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:31,471
Just because I left you,
are you acting like a hero here?

547
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:40,856
Hey dark man! I don't have anyone.

548
00:52:42,273 --> 00:52:43,817
The people I have one of them died.

549
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:45,567
I can't lose her.

550
00:52:45,735 --> 00:52:47,070
Why are you still talking to him, Maria?

551
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:49,072
I expected you'd hit him.

552
00:52:50,155 --> 00:52:50,989
You calm down.

553
00:52:52,074 --> 00:52:54,117
Sir, please don't.

554
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:56,077
A girl's life would get ruined.

555
00:52:56,244 --> 00:52:59,413
Pay my money or give me your daughter.

556
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,697
Go...go away...

557
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:09,199
This is my family problem,
don't interfere.

558
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:10,326
Go away!

559
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:19,875
Come...come...

560
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:22,878
Come...come...

561
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:24,714
Come...come...

562
00:55:49,362 --> 00:55:58,327
Yesupadam, my loan with interest must
reach my home by tomorrow evening.

563
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:01,831
If not you'll not live.

564
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:19,932
Threatened Yesupadam...

565
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,110
He warned him to pay up.

566
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:39,407
Don't know what Yesupadam would do?

567
00:57:02,137 --> 00:57:03,638
Hello...please, come in.

568
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,226
Two years contract.

569
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:12,188
First year salary will be
adjusted with advance.

570
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,858
You'll get only the second year's salary.

571
00:57:16,025 --> 00:57:19,068
If you're not happy with job,
you can't quit midway.

572
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,445
You're going to Sudan.
You know that, right?

573
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,490
Sign the agreement.

574
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:50,347
Seal was telling you all these years,
good sense prevailed on you now.

575
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,488
Settle the dark man's loan.

576
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:14,619
Don't take it as for him, it was Pani.

577
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:18,498
Take care of her.

578
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:26,047
You were born in sea...
you grew up in sea...

579
00:58:27,673 --> 00:58:31,844
How can you leave this place? How?

580
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,812
Just 2 years only!

581
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:46,316
No problem, bye.

582
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:31,023
You were living happily with sea
and your friends.

583
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:36,152
Because of me...because of me...

584
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,701
Not because of you...it was for you.

585
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:51,541
Don't cry.

586
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:00,174
Don't cry.

587
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:09,141
Will you send me off with tears?

588
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,243
Just 2 years only.

589
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:32,413
It'll fly away.

590
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:50,303
I'll be back at the wink of an eye.

591
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,592
I didn't have the courage that day
to turn back and see her face.

592
01:01:33,552 --> 01:01:34,970
2 years have passed.

593
01:01:36,304 --> 01:01:40,891
I'll go home and see my Pani
in person not in a photo.

594
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:43,019
Are you sad, buddy?

595
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:47,856
His lover is waiting for him back home.

596
01:01:48,023 --> 01:01:49,775
My good friend has left her there.

597
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:51,485
Will you please stop it?

598
01:01:52,235 --> 01:01:53,820
Do you've lover back home?

599
01:01:57,157 --> 01:01:58,033
Wife?

600
01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:00,494
You'd have escaped from her.

601
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:02,162
It seems he's married.

602
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:06,499
He's not a happy bachelor like us.

603
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,262
From Andhra!

604
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:15,742
This is Lord Venkateswara's dollar.

605
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:06,052
Where are we now?

606
01:06:44,378 --> 01:06:45,380
What?

607
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:48,925
Nothing...he said sizes have changed.

608
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:50,425
Will it fit him?

609
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:56,557
Forget it, if he eats your cooking,
he'll get back to shape.

610
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,527
Sister!
- Come in.

611
01:07:10,695 --> 01:07:12,530
Sister!
- I'm here.

612
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:16,700
Got two calls from Africa, sister.

613
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,494
Don't know what it is, come quickly.

614
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:19,327
When?

615
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:31,296
I'm Williams here, Maria's colleague.

616
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:32,922
Where is he?

617
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:36,385
I called you to tell something.

618
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,302
Go ahead.

619
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:43,474
Few workers in my company have
been kidnapped by terrorists.

620
01:07:43,641 --> 01:07:46,143
We don't have any information
about them till now.

621
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:48,980
We suspect Maria is also among them.

622
01:07:49,146 --> 01:07:49,896
What are you saying?

623
01:07:50,063 --> 01:07:54,902
You don't worry, Sudan government
is trying to rescue them.

624
01:07:55,068 --> 01:07:56,402
Nothing will happen to them.

625
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,112
You...

626
01:08:44,322 --> 01:08:47,199
Give it to me...

627
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:59,961
Tell him to give me...I'm hungry.

628
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:04,298
Tell him to give.

629
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:25,484
Yesterday...she was there...

630
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:31,364
I was also there with her...

631
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:35,243
I...

632
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,095
I was there...

633
01:10:06,396 --> 01:10:17,908
Millions of stars in the sky showered
light when you were with me...

634
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:36,425
She filled my heart with honey
and happiness..

635
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:06,994
She entwined me like a plant...

636
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:58,958
My heart...my thoughts are
filled with you...

637
01:11:59,126 --> 01:12:07,634
Till yesterday sorrow wasn't
a part of my life...

638
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:17,016
It was your breathe I felt in
the jingle of my bangles...

639
01:12:17,184 --> 01:12:23,856
O time, go back and get her for me...

640
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:09,940
Waves of tears are rolling for you...

641
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:19,240
It's waiting eagerly for arrival...

642
01:16:02,097 --> 01:16:04,016
Sir, we sent him trusting you, right?

643
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:06,185
We can find a job for a man.

644
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,063
Can we guard his entire life?

645
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:14,609
Forget about your guarding duty,
you sent him there, right?

646
01:16:14,944 --> 01:16:15,736
Answer me.

647
01:16:16,362 --> 01:16:19,072
Look, I sent him on his mother's request.

648
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:21,866
Ask his mother or
the company where he works.

649
01:16:22,033 --> 01:16:23,952
I don't have anything do with it.

650
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,054
Bloody...

651
01:18:44,538 --> 01:18:45,414
Bloody...

652
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:49,167
Bloody mad men!

653
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,212
What do you want?

654
01:18:53,046 --> 01:18:54,214
What do you want?

655
01:18:58,342 --> 01:18:59,219
Money?

656
01:19:00,052 --> 01:19:00,970
We don't have.

657
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:05,641
Neither you have nor do I!

658
01:19:06,266 --> 01:19:07,559
Can't you see it?

659
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:14,774
All we've is just life.

660
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,277
Take that also, bloody!

661
01:19:21,948 --> 01:19:22,449
What?

662
01:19:33,626 --> 01:19:34,668
Fire!

663
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:38,630
Come.

664
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:40,966
Come.

665
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:44,927
They'll not kill me.

666
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:46,804
They need money, right?

667
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:04,445
If you cut my legs and
ask me to dance...

668
01:20:04,612 --> 01:20:08,365
If you strangle my neck
and ask me to sing...

669
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,496
If you cut my wings and
ask me to fly...

670
01:20:13,662 --> 01:20:16,832
Sorrow in my heart is turning
into erupting lava...

671
01:20:21,252 --> 01:20:25,340
I'm a hunter who hunts in sea...

672
01:20:25,506 --> 01:20:29,384
I'm the king of sea...

673
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:34,098
I spill blood to fish out pearls...

674
01:20:34,265 --> 01:20:39,269
Maria is the king of sea...

675
01:20:42,354 --> 01:20:50,612
If they make prawn gravy,
I'm on moon...

676
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:55,200
Salted fish curry is mouth watering...

677
01:20:55,367 --> 01:21:00,122
The intoxication will last for a day...

678
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:09,087
I've put lid on the volcano
of anger for you...

679
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:35,292
I'm singing alone before
people with stone hearts...

680
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:47,971
I'm struggling between
these heartless people...

681
01:22:50,722 --> 01:22:54,810
I came alone to a strange country,
I was living like a corpse here...

682
01:22:54,976 --> 01:23:01,315
I lost my sense living with the
hope of uniting with you...

683
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:09,517
Sir, I'm AOC worker Maria here.

684
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:13,770
Yes, I'm Maria.

685
01:25:14,563 --> 01:25:16,190
Where are you, Maria?

686
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:21,694
Sir...want money.

687
01:25:22,612 --> 01:25:24,447
They're shooting people here, sir.

688
01:25:25,073 --> 01:25:27,200
I don't get what you say!

689
01:25:27,324 --> 01:25:29,577
Yes Pani, it's me.

690
01:25:31,787 --> 01:25:32,788
I'm alive.

691
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:40,252
I don't know how long I will be alive!

692
01:25:41,337 --> 01:25:43,881
What? What did you say now?

693
01:25:44,716 --> 01:25:47,302
Yes sir...help sir...

694
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:52,806
I don't get what you're saying, Maria.

695
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:00,147
Yes, it's me...tell me...

696
01:26:02,148 --> 01:26:04,234
I don't know if I can see you again or not.

697
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:07,362
Please don't say like that.

698
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:09,905
I don't get what you say!

699
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:16,953
Where are you? Please tell me that.
Where are you?

700
01:26:19,914 --> 01:26:23,251
No sir...I don't know, sir.

701
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:35,304
It's all over, Pani.

702
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:37,388
Why are you talking like this?

703
01:26:39,682 --> 01:26:43,353
You...don't wait for me.

704
01:26:51,193 --> 01:26:52,278
Listen to me carefully.

705
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:53,988
Nothing will happen to you.

706
01:26:54,154 --> 01:26:55,113
Nothing will happen to you.

707
01:26:55,613 --> 01:26:56,989
Yes sir...

708
01:26:58,992 --> 01:27:01,536
Speaking...speaking...

709
01:27:04,122 --> 01:27:05,539
You're my husband.

710
01:27:05,998 --> 01:27:07,791
Nobody can separate us.

711
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:18,092
I'll wait for your return.

712
01:27:29,561 --> 01:27:31,396
Can you hear me, Maria?

713
01:27:59,256 --> 01:28:05,929
Hello brother! Kill me right now!

714
01:28:07,095 --> 01:28:11,099
If not you'll regret for it later.

715
01:28:16,688 --> 01:28:19,065
I've informed Pani, it's over.

716
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:21,068
Over!

717
01:28:42,753 --> 01:28:43,712
What happened?

718
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,172
What did they do with you?

719
01:28:48,551 --> 01:28:50,303
I was scared without you.

720
01:29:07,652 --> 01:29:08,653
How, buddy?

721
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:25,543
Let's go from here.

722
01:29:26,418 --> 01:29:29,505
Yes, let's go from here.

723
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:31,006
Let's go.

724
01:29:36,677 --> 01:29:37,679
Where is he?

725
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,265
It's all over, Pani.

726
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,560
Don't wait for me.

727
01:29:45,686 --> 01:29:49,439
Don't cry...don't cry...

728
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:56,279
Don't cry, Maria...

729
01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:08,041
Come...come...

730
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,333
Come.

731
01:30:15,881 --> 01:30:18,550
I don't know if this mother's
love can bring him,

732
01:30:19,676 --> 01:30:23,471
but I'm confident your love will
surely bring him back.

733
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:59,336
You're coming...you're coming...

734
01:34:10,595 --> 01:34:14,015
Yesupadam...Yesupadam...

735
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:21,356
Maria is coming....he's coming...

736
01:34:22,524 --> 01:34:26,444
Yesupadam, he's coming!

737
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:29,363
He's coming!

738
01:34:47,796 --> 01:34:50,465
Maria is coming...Maria is coming...

739
01:34:50,632 --> 01:34:51,634
Who told you?

740
01:34:52,092 --> 01:34:53,510
I'm telling!

741
01:34:57,096 --> 01:34:58,431
I made inquiry.

742
01:34:58,765 --> 01:34:59,975
He'll never come.

743
01:35:03,435 --> 01:35:04,311
He'll come.

744
01:35:05,814 --> 01:35:07,315
He'll never come.

745
01:35:07,606 --> 01:35:08,858
I'll come.

746
01:35:19,493 --> 01:35:21,328
You humiliated me here, right?

747
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:25,832
I'm like fire, what will you do now?

748
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:28,583
Are you laughing?

749
01:35:29,001 --> 01:35:32,128
Laugh...hasn't your pride come down yet?

750
01:35:38,676 --> 01:35:41,095
I should've taken you to task
that day itself.

751
01:35:43,222 --> 01:35:45,516
You can't do anything, you dog.

752
01:35:45,682 --> 01:35:47,476
Are you calling me a dog?

753
01:35:50,354 --> 01:35:51,771
Can't I do anything?

754
01:35:54,358 --> 01:35:55,693
Can't I do anything?

755
01:36:06,368 --> 01:36:08,371
If Maria can't get me,
nobody else can get me.

756
01:36:08,537 --> 01:36:09,788
I'll kill you.

757
01:36:18,462 --> 01:36:19,547
Will you kill me?

758
01:36:20,716 --> 01:36:22,551
Okay, take it...kill me.

759
01:36:22,716 --> 01:36:23,717
Kill me I say!

760
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:42,319
Yesupadam...Maria is coming.

761
01:36:42,484 --> 01:37:45,042
Maria is coming....he's coming.

762
01:45:46,734 --> 01:45:52,198
When cyclones of fire hits...

763
01:45:52,864 --> 01:45:57,994
When the snow clad mountains of mercy melts...

764
01:45:58,662 --> 01:46:04,208
When injustice touches the sky...

765
01:46:04,376 --> 01:46:09,672
When humans lose humanity....

766
01:46:10,506 --> 01:46:15,594
When life is strained by tyranny...

767
01:46:15,761 --> 01:46:21,016
Your love will not stop...

768
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:27,771
My heart get going...
my heart get going...

769
01:46:33,903 --> 01:46:39,949
You get up and run...

770
01:46:40,117 --> 01:46:46,079
Love will never end...

771
01:46:58,091 --> 01:47:09,602
Though our skies are different...
Though our hopes are shattered...

772
01:47:09,769 --> 01:47:21,445
Though youth has changed...
Though you've forgotten me...

773
01:47:21,613 --> 01:47:26,659
Even if world loses status...

774
01:47:26,826 --> 01:47:32,414
Your love won't stop....

775
01:48:08,698 --> 01:48:14,787
Don't get afraid or scared...
Your sorrows are yesterday's tales...

776
01:48:14,994 --> 01:48:17,288
We're new born...

777
01:48:17,456 --> 01:48:20,375
Your words are cool like moonbeam...

778
01:48:20,542 --> 01:48:26,213
Your love will stand test of time...

779
01:48:26,381 --> 01:48:30,968
In a fraction of second it vanished...

780
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:09,252
My Maria promised to come
at the wink of an eye.

781
01:49:10,755 --> 01:49:12,506
I'm living for you only.

782
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:18,094
Come back...I must bear your child.

783
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,846
It must play with waves.

784
01:49:22,349 --> 01:49:23,600
We must watch it.

785
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,228
Come back quickly....come...

786
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:29,521
Come!

787
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:32,900
Come.

788
01:49:34,443 --> 01:49:35,277
Come.

789
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,653
Mother!

790
01:51:16,328 --> 01:51:16,995
Mother!

791
01:55:37,067 --> 01:55:37,943
It's sea!

792
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:42,306
Where you my King?

793
01:57:47,729 --> 01:57:50,773
Dusk has fallen...

794
01:58:06,996 --> 01:58:09,414
The food has gone cold...

795
01:58:12,417 --> 01:58:15,712
My heart is sinking...

796
01:58:16,712 --> 01:58:21,259
If you're with me...

797
01:58:22,426 --> 01:58:30,100
The sky will be bright...

798
01:58:33,229 --> 01:58:35,939
Today you're not with me...

799
01:58:36,105 --> 01:58:42,444
My heart is broken...
heart is broken...

800
01:59:03,047 --> 01:59:07,260
Eyes are searching for eyelids...

801
01:59:07,426 --> 01:59:10,595
Sea of tears rolling down...

802
01:59:10,762 --> 01:59:12,765
Body won over life...

803
01:59:12,931 --> 01:59:15,600
Moment stood still like eon...

804
01:59:15,768 --> 01:59:17,728
Where you my King?

805
01:59:21,564 --> 01:59:25,317
What am I to do, my king?

806
01:59:28,029 --> 01:59:36,328
I'm living for you only...

807
01:59:40,832 --> 01:59:44,002
For 21 days I was held
captive by the Sudan militia.

808
01:59:44,252 --> 01:59:47,672
For 9 days I ran over 300 kilometres
without food and water.

809
01:59:48,547 --> 01:59:51,007
I lost my friend Chinna in sea.

810
01:59:51,466 --> 01:59:52,801
Lost Swamy in desert.

811
01:59:53,844 --> 01:59:55,846
I overcame every hurdle
to come back alive.

812
01:59:56,305 --> 01:59:57,347
For my Pani!

813
02:00:07,064 --> 02:00:08,982
Now only I'm breathing.

814
02:00:09,692 --> 02:00:11,109
You're my breathe.
