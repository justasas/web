1
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,035
What do you want?

2
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:21,019
- Where are the jewels?
- Downstairs, at the vault.

3
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:25,092
- Gimme the key!
- What key? I don't have it!

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,004
The key or you're dead!

5
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,039
- In the drawer!
- Which one?

6
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:36,084
- I recognize your voice...
- Turn around and you're a dead man!

7
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:41,032
Please, don't!

8
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:50,032
- It's locked!
- I have no key for that!

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,024
- Give it to me!
- Be careful!

10
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:02,003
- It's in my pocket!
- Give it to me! Fast!

11
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,067
- Please!
- Give it to me!

12
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:11,056
- You'll regret that!
- I'll kill you!

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,007
Let's go!...
Let's go downstairs!

14
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:23,075
- You're opening up early, Mr. Vaziri.
- What are you doing here?

15
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,096
- Get in here!
- Help! Thief!

16
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,087
The old man rang the alarm!

17
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:37,091
What have you done, Hussein?
Why did you shoot?

18
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:43,007
He's with him!
Help! He killed him!

19
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:10,075
Get away from here! Bastards!

20
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,015
Go away!

21
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,052
Bastards!

22
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,012
Go to hell!

23
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:31,003
- [Text missing]
- [Text missing]

24
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:35,096
Get away, you bastards!
I'll shoot!

25
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:10,087
What's your problem?
Asshole!

26
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,060
I waited for 2 hours.
They wanted you there, personally.

27
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:04,016
- You got it or not?
- Of course I did.

28
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,028
Who do you think you're talking to?

29
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,056
- I was almost desperate.
- I waited for 2 hours. It sucks!

30
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:21,027
You said that without the money you
wouldn't marry my sister.

31
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,048
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

32
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:31,024
Doc says, it's ok.
Smile!

33
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,088
What's that?

34
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:38,096
I found a bag.
I haven't looked inside it yet.

35
00:05:55,031 --> 00:06:00,036
In front if you, I don't hear you...
Yes, in front of you.

36
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,051
And this is for us.
Why is it torn?

37
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,088
Seems like marrying got her fat.

38
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,084
[Text missing]

39
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:36,068
It says "75", followed by... six zeros!

40
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:41,043
- How much is that?
- 75 million.

41
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,075
Are you kidding me?

42
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,004
Of course not! It's
a receipt for 75 million.

43
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:58,043
"Italian necklace.
For Ms. Roxanne Mazaheri."

44
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:07,060
You wanna humiliate me?
You know my situation.

45
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:12,063
I would never do that...
Especially to you.

46
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,072
Anyway, she paid for it.
Let's not argue about that.

47
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,007
How many months of hard
work equals to that?

48
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:26,084
Depends.
It seems you won the lottery!

49
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,007
"Expensive" is the key word
for every job.

50
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,007
Otherwise, everything goes wrong.

51
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:41,056
You need to be professional
and sometimes more than that.

52
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:46,048
- Ethics.
- Exactly.

53
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:51,076
- Honesty, I would say.

54
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,088
It's the same thing.

55
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:01,036
- Do I bother you?
- No, we enjoy hearing from you.

56
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:07,043
Honesty is the basis
of all professions.

57
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:12,004
Even yours.
It's a common profession.

58
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:16,004
There are many people
like you all over the world.

59
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,072
Last year, in Europe,
a colleague of yours...

60
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:22,072
...a colleague of ours,
I would say...

61
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:28,031
Took my wallet.
Seems he needed it badly.

62
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,084
He stole it you mean.

63
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:38,015
Everything was here before us.
Everything will be still here after we're gone.

64
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:42,048
Frm the ones that do it,
some are really affected.

65
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,067
Start to feel
guilty.

66
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:49,048
It's not so common to see
people like you. Open minded ones.

67
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:53,087
But you're not alone
in this profession.

68
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:57,036
Add me to the list.

69
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,011
It's easier to count the
ones that are outside the list.

70
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:09,008
"You wanna catch a thief? Arrest everybody."

71
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:24,048
From all our coleagues, only
the honest ones make it.

72
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:28,004
These are strong fags!

73
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:32,072
Some days ago, someone
stole a bag.

74
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,087
Found some change and
4 bus tickets.

75
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:43,048
I insulted them
the worst way that I could.

76
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:48,000
They hurt that lady
for some change.

77
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,083
Now, everytime she hears a
bike, she's freaking out.

78
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:56,000
She didn't let that bag.
She was drawn for 50 metres.

79
00:09:56,083 --> 00:10:01,007
You must know exactly what
you're doing, before you do it.

80
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:04,056
Calculate the consequences.

81
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,004
Don't make so much damage
for just some change.

82
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,039
A woman, ouside
a bank...

83
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:16,091
Guess what's in the bag.
Choose the right time.

84
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:22,036
Divide good and bad
neighborhoods.

85
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:25,091
- How?
- That's art.

86
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,052
Bastard! Is he preaching us?
I'm totally broke!

87
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:37,028
He was talkin to me.
I have the dirty face around.

88
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:42,072
- How is a thief?
- Like him.

89
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,052
He thinks we're all the same.

90
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,083
Guess what's his profession.

91
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:51,043
He ain't robbing bags.
He plays with people's minds.

92
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,072
Keep your own!

93
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:57,039
If I had one
I wouldn't be in this mess right now!

94
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:05,028
If we were professionals,
we wouldn't be here.

95
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:09,019
- What's his speciallity?
- Crook. Charlatan.

96
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,068
You saw how he entered
in our conversation?

97
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:22,063
I hope you're not angry.

98
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,072
No. You're the
most experienced of all.

99
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,028
Specially with bags.

100
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:34,059
My office is right across the
street, if you need anything.

101
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:37,060
It's my treat.
See ya.

102
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,072
You don't seem that kind.

103
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,091
- Keep that, in any case. -
- Tear it.

104
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:52,052
Keep it, Hussein.
You never know.

105
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,068
What an idiot! "It's my treat"!
Two teas please!

106
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:02,072
Let's go. You bike
must be ready by now.

107
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,067
- You've seen that?
- What?

108
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:50,015
You've seen her bag? Is she
entering a bank?

109
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:55,056
Thieves need a
sixth sense. That's what he said.

110
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:59,039
Guess what's in the bag.

111
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,007
- What have you done to it?
- It's here, it's here.

112
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:07,004
Smells nice.
Lemme tell you this...

113
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,019
He was talking about bags...

114
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:15,087
...and now I'm looking the
bags, instead of looking the women!

115
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:23,015
You've seen that? She was holding the bag
firmly! What's inside damn it?

116
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,012
Some change and 4 bus tickets.

117
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:33,039
Look at her!
What the fuck is happening today?

118
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:36,096
- She didn't have a bag.
- I'm not talking about the bag!

119
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:43,043
If my siter finds out that I point
women at you, she'll be mad!

120
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,019
It's here.
The good neighborhood.

121
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:53,008
Lets go see how a 75,000,000
worth necklace looks like.

122
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,004
Lok at her!...
No, it's underneath it.

123
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:03,008
- You've finsh?
- No, I have some more.

124
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:06,024
And me, I have a feeling!

125
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:14,096
It musrt be here...
It's here, allright.

126
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:47,051
If she had a good body,
she'll be awesome!

127
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,063
I got a question.

128
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:06,008
- Shall we go in?
- I hear allright.

129
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:09,080
- I'll explain everything inside.
- Tell me.

130
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:17,063
This ring...
was his wedding ring.

131
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,091
He got fat and he
had to cut it off.

132
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:24,047
I'm getting married now.
Can you fix that?

133
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,087
We don't "fix" things.
You must go somewhere else.

134
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,043
In Galubandak.
Someone will "fix" it there.

135
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:37,052
Come on, smile!

136
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:42,072
To look at women
again!

137
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,096
How was it at your time?

138
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:52,024
Did women go out naked?
Without all these veils?

139
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:58,015
- How old were you then?
- 17 or 18 years old.

140
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,000
May I ask something else?

141
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,063
- Were you really insulted?
- Weren't you?

142
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:11,000
Not as much as you were.
You're very sensitive after all.

143
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:15,087
We're not good enough for customers.
That's what hurt me more.

144
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:20,039
The way he was looking at us!
Did he have to do that?

145
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:26,011
He was so ignorrant! Forget it!
I'll do a fag.

146
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:33,011
I'm not smoking in front of you.
I respect you too much.

147
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:38,028
A fag will do
good. Trust me.

148
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:46,080
I really like you, you know.

149
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:51,035
I know you too good.

150
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:06,028
He doesn't know you.
He's always counting money.

151
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:11,000
Does he has anyone in his life?
44 people at most.

152
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:16,011
Everyone he has can barely fill a bus.
Don't get mad.

153
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:20,076
Respect him and he'll
respect you back. That's the it goes.

154
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:25,059
Are you defending him?
Did you noticed the way he looked at me?

155
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:32,031
I'm not defending him! Don't
be so hard on yourself!

156
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,096
All I got is you
and my sister.

157
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:40,019
I'm so glad you two are getting
married. I was worried about her.

158
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:43,075
It's not that you couldn't
find someone better...

159
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:48,087
...but, no way you could find
a better brother-in-law!

160
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,067
As for him,
I will take care of him.

161
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,016
The one that pissed you off.
I'll teach him a lesson.

162
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:01,039
- What are you gonna do?
- You'll see.

163
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,076
- I mean with the bag.
- I'll give it to my sister.

164
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,048
Throw it somewhere.

165
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:15,048
It's a pity, the bag is nice.
Would you throw money?

166
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:19,067
It's not the same.
Money goes around.

167
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:24,004
But a bag can easily
be recognized.

168
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:29,004
You're right... She doesn't
like black colour anyway.

169
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:32,051
She prefers white colour.
A white bag for the marriage!

170
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,039
You must be reliable.
I must scream 10 times before she's here.

171
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,056
He's is in his own world.

172
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,092
I sceam his name
all the time.

173
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:20,071
You're right. Medicine
makes him a bit slow.

174
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:27,091
It's not his fault. Doctor says
he'll be allright, someday.

175
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,048
Number 33! Hussein
Emandendin! The order?

176
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:37,024
You see?
He's not coming.

177
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,032
If there's a problem,
I can arrange that.

178
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,000
He's a good kid.

179
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:49,071
Everybody likes him.
Even the boss.

180
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:55,084
They told him to work in the
kitchen, if he has problems elsewhere.

181
00:19:56,016 --> 00:20:02,016
- But he doesnt't want to.
- He's claustrophobic.

182
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:05,087
He can't be closed
somewhere.

183
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:11,052
He likes riding a
bike. Makes him feel free.

184
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:14,004
He says it's
clear-minding.

185
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,076
He never wears a helmet.
I keep telling him to.

186
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:23,067
If something happens to him,
he'll be left with no brains at all!

187
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,019
You talk to him.
He's sensitive.

188
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,015
See you later.

189
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:43,043
This is for Vozara.
Then leave this to Alvand.

190
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:33,000
Mr. Sageste,
your order.

191
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:36,039
The levator is broken.
Forth flour.

192
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:41,064
Can you come down?
You see I have my bike...

193
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:45,060
- Nothing will happen to it.
- Open up.

194
00:24:35,092 --> 00:24:39,040
Thanks.
Sorry about the elevator.

195
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:42,008
- What do I owe you?
- 18,500.

196
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:59,031
Here's 19,000.
Keep the change.

197
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:04,087
- It's you Mr. Sageste?
- Yes. It's me.

198
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:08,019
It's me, Hussein.

199
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:12,067
From Salemse...
At the Signals...

200
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:21,067
AT Communications!...
You've changed, I didn't recognized you.

201
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:25,092
It's cortizone to blame. I can't
recognize myself either.

202
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,076
- You've changed so much!
- You've changed yourself.

203
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,059
You were a holy man!
Aren't you in heaven yet?

204
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:40,028
You got a bike in the street?
Go! Here you are.

205
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:45,003
I insist... Don't get lost again.
I must go now.

206
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,036
Wait! What do you want?

207
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:31,027
Mr. Izandi...
Third floor.

208
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:35,039
Stay here. Park
the bike in that corner.

209
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,028
- I must deliver.
- Wait. I'm coming.

210
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,056
- Will we wait a long time?
- Until your daughter comes downstairs.

211
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,067
- When?
- Well, I wouldn't know. It's your daughter after all.

212
00:27:50,092 --> 00:27:54,056
Please...
I'm a mother...

213
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:58,068
This is the last time...
She won't do it again.

214
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,015
Please wait in the car.

215
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:11,039
- The delivery boy?
- He has nothing to do with the party.

216
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:25,039
- What am I supposed to do?
- Boss told you allready. Just park.

217
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:29,008
- I got pizzas to deliver.
- Watch your mouth!

218
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:32,008
- I got work to do!
- Ask the boss.

219
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:48,048
I'm sorry but I've got work to do.
What can I do?

220
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:51,031
What were you told to?

221
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:56,023
- There's a car coming!
- Hide in the trees!

222
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:19,051
- Where are you going?
- In that house.

223
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:22,028
- In which floor?
- Second floor. Let me pass.

224
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:24,044
Are you goinf to the party?

225
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,059
- We're not up yet!
- You look suspicious!

226
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:30,056
- Put her in the car!
- We're not up yet!

227
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:36,083
Don't talk...
Just keep moving. Cooperate!

228
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,051
- You'll come to our tiny littly party.
- But we're not up yet!

229
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,080
Put her inside!

230
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:29,071
I don't care about second floor!
I must go the third one!

231
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,087
- So?
- They have ordered!

232
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:35,092
They must be hungry.

233
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:38,059
Don't you worry about them.

234
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:44,023
It's my job!
Let me do it!

235
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:50,004
Put the bike on
the sidewalk.

236
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:56,000
- Let me go!
- Do as I say!

237
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:58,000
How long do I have to wait?

238
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,000
As long as it's necessary!

239
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,084
- Come over here!
- What's wrong?

240
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,043
But we're married!
Let me explain!

241
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:13,079
- Aras, do something!
- Move!

242
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,035
How old are you?

243
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:13,028
Aren't you a bit young
for a soldier?

244
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:17,079
- How old are you?
- 15. No, 18.

245
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:38,000
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

246
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:40,039
- In which floor?
- Second floor.

247
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,043
Wait here.
She will come down

248
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,063
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Wait.

249
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:49,032
- She's waiting for me in the midnight.
- You got a cellphone?

250
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:52,028
- Should I call from there?
- You got a cellphone?

251
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:58,011
Call her. She'll come down...
nothing is wrong. Just call.

252
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:06,023
- Lutenant!
- What's wrong?

253
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:12,024
You'll get afterwards.
Wait in the car.

254
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,048
Fast!

255
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,032
Can I call the restaurant so i
know what to do?

256
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:35,008
You cannot go.
Make way, I need some fresh air.

257
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:55,012
That's good...
Boss can perform miracles.

258
00:34:57,092 --> 00:35:01,079
He needed some air.
He got him!

259
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:13,047
What's going on up there?

260
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,007
- I don't know.
- They're dancing.

261
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,023
- Just dancing?
- I don't know.

262
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:51,028
Put the gun down.
I'm still young.

263
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:59,071
- And why you are here?
- To watch out.

264
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,076
So noone escapes.

265
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:07,059
- And if someone does?
- I'll get him.

266
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:11,087
- You're so young. How you're gonna do that?
- With my gun.

267
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:17,047
At least you got a
reason for being here.

268
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:22,083
Has that ever happen to you?

269
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:29,067
- To have fan?
- What does that mean?

270
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:34,039
Have you ever danced
witha girl before?

271
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,087
No.

272
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:44,032
Look, they're gonna stop
that car.

273
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:52,043
What do you want?

274
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,052
I brought 2 girls before.
I'm here to pick them up.

275
00:36:56,076 --> 00:37:01,036
- Name? Floor?
- Afsani. Second floor.

276
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:04,076
You can ring. Nothing else.

277
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:11,080
A taxi for Ms. Asfani is here.

278
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:17,043
Get in the car
and just go.

279
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,032
They are having all the
fan and I'm stuck here waiting.

280
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:35,084
It's wrong to deliver in
this neighborhood.

281
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:39,080
- Why should I wait?
- Don't you know?

282
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:45,028
If you leave, you can
tell them.

283
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:49,063
They won't come down and
we'll wait till morning.

284
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:57,063
Exactly. We are waiting.
We ain't eating or drinking.

285
00:37:57,092 --> 00:38:00,000
Do you wait for everyone to come out?

286
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:04,092
They are done.
They are coming out.

287
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:08,084
- Done with what?
- Dunno, whatever they were doing.

288
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:17,000
- This way, ladies.
- Why? We didn't do anything!

289
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:22,060
Don't you touch me!
I'm coming!

290
00:38:23,096 --> 00:38:27,056
Come. The party goes on
there.

291
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:30,064
I can smell their perfume.
Even from here.

292
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:34,007
You're lucky.
I can't smell a thing.

293
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:36,019
How long?

294
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:39,044
Last time we were through
at 4 o'clock.

295
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:45,056
They sleeping in the morning.
They do all that stuff at night.

296
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,063
- What stuff?
- I don't know. Getting drunk.

297
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:54,079
Have you eaten anything?

298
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,052
It's my treat then.

299
00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:10,023
- You have not eaten. Take this.
- Thanks, but I can't.

300
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,008
- Come on!
- No, thanks.

301
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,075
Get some!

302
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,000
What's that?

303
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:34,016
- A gift from above.
- Is it raining pizzas?

304
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:51,084
Get some, so the others dare
to get some also.

305
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:59,059
- Only if I pay for that.
- One of your men has paid allready.

306
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:03,012
- One of my men?
- Figure of speech. Look...

307
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,076
Really, I can?

308
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:19,048
Share it.

309
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:38,056
Get some. It's for free.

310
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:45,007
The boss goty some himself.
You can get some also.

311
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:59,003
- How old are you?
- Will you tell the others?

312
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:03,036
- Fifteen.
- Too young for the army.

313
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:09,000
My big brother died.
I took his identity card.

314
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:22,003
- What's going on here?
- A party.

315
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:26,023
May I get the kids?

316
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:30,059
- That's what's happening every night?
- I don't know.

317
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:58,079
Look at Hussein!
So stylish!

318
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,043
- Why is he dressed like that?
- I'll tell you afterwards.

319
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:07,036
- Will we be allowed to go in?
- Trust me.

320
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:13,003
Allright.
You look like rich people.

321
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:44,019
May I help you?

322
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:51,028
- There was an old man...
- Mr. Vaziri is downstairs.

323
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:55,079
I want gold for
my fiance.

324
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:58,000
What can I do to help you?

325
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,003
- I would like a set, with necklace, please.
- One moment please.

326
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:21,092
- Is mr. Vaziri here?
- Coming right up.

327
00:44:22,063 --> 00:44:26,007
- We're in a hurry.
- Would you like to drink something?

328
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:30,007
Mozafarians are here!

329
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:34,016
- What can I do to help you?
- A nicklace, please.

330
00:44:34,076 --> 00:44:38,076
You have a price in mind,
so I can help you easier?

331
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,043
- Something between one...
- Two million please.

332
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:48,076
Let me show you
some of our items here.

333
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:56,023
The blue ones,
that's what I like most.

334
00:44:56,083 --> 00:45:00,083
They are much more expensive
than you told me.

335
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:04,048
Come this way.
I'll show you some more.

336
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:12,096
I suggest these.
They are Italian made...

337
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:21,079
Or this.
In crimson gold...

338
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:28,015
What's your favourite?
Crimson or white gold?

339
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:37,052
Gold from India or
Pakistan are really nice.

340
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:41,083
We don't have that kind.

341
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:48,076
Italian and Iran made are
in fashion nowdays.

342
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:54,039
We don't import from
anywhere else.

343
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:59,067
You prefer something from the
ones I show you?

344
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:14,084
What are we doing now?

345
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:20,047
You pay. You choose.

346
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,052
How are you?

347
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:40,055
Your order is ready.
I hope you like it.

348
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,091
May I see it?

349
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:48,039
You want a mirror?

350
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,003
We're in a hurry.
What do we owe you?

351
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:58,059
It was a pleasure helping you.
9,600,000.

352
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,003
He didn't even looked us!

353
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:15,012
- Bye. Come back soon!
- The pleasure is all ours.

354
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:25,076
- I'll try this one.
- Do you like that?

355
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,079
- What is it?
- Diamond on white gold.

356
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:43,044
- It's price?
- It's in your limits.

357
00:47:50,096 --> 00:47:55,036
- What do you say? ...The necklace.
- It's nice.

358
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,007
Do you want to try
the earrings also?

359
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,059
- Yes, give them to her, please.
- They must be expensive.

360
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:08,092
Give her the ring please.

361
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:13,000
Are the ones I asked
more expensive?

362
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,003
I have no idea.

363
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:21,003
We don't have anything like this.
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

364
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:25,063
They must be more expensive.
They are bigger.

365
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:33,064
- Is this nice?
- Yes, wear the one too.

366
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:36,012
They are not shoes!

367
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,047
- How much do they cost?
- 250,000.

368
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:49,008
250,000 is the price
for this pair of earrings.

369
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:53,016
And the necklace
costs 1,550,000.

370
00:48:53,079 --> 00:49:00,007
Total price, 1,800,000.
That's less than you were willing to give.

371
00:49:03,003 --> 00:49:05,092
May I give you one advise?

372
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:10,000
You've chosen something Italian.

373
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:17,003
Buy something you can easily
refund.

374
00:49:17,068 --> 00:49:21,072
We want to keep our
customers happy.

375
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:29,039
Buy something handmade
from Iran.

376
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:36,083
- Can we see something?
- I don't have anything here.

377
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:42,036
You'll find somethiong in the Bazaar,
in Galoumbandak.

378
00:49:43,027 --> 00:49:51,023
If he was to marry my daughter,
i'd advise him to invest.

379
00:49:51,076 --> 00:49:55,063
And don't buy jewels.

380
00:49:55,092 --> 00:50:01,039
Gold can be
easily refunded.

381
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,059
Bye.

382
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:12,087
And congratulations.

383
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,056
What got into you?

384
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:26,056
- What's wrong?
- It's Ali's fault!

385
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:31,056
He told me to get dressed like
that. I didn't want in the first place.

386
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,087
He has no idea with whom
he's dealing with.

387
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:40,012
- Wanna fag?
- No. I'm cold.

388
00:50:40,063 --> 00:50:42,031
I'll get your jacket.

389
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:51,087
- It's my fault you got upset?
- No. Let's go.

390
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,052
Your cap.

391
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:10,047
- Do you want me to take you somewhere?
- No, go.

392
00:51:11,016 --> 00:51:13,036
- Will you bring my sister?
- Yes, go!

393
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:21,079
You're mad because I
raised my veil?

394
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,016
I wanted you to see the necklace.

395
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:32,096
I was so glad to see you like that.

396
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:36,008
With a costume and a tie.

397
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:40,063
You were good.
We'll get married soon.

398
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:46,015
I didn't want to come.
I only came cause you asked me to.

399
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,027
I don't care about the jewels.

400
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:56,039
We can rent some.
To keep the pretexts.

401
00:52:57,027 --> 00:52:59,079
We'll return them afterwards.

402
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:03,019
I don't need them.

403
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:11,000
Are you mad at me?
Tell me, are you?

404
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,032
- No, I'm not.
- Why we went there?

405
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:21,023
- There must be a reason.
- Nothing really.

406
00:53:23,052 --> 00:53:29,044
It was veryu expensive. I was thinking
something around 200, 250.

407
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:33,096
Ali said 1,500,000
and you said 2,000,000.

408
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:37,051
Is it my fault now?
What have I done?

409
00:53:38,076 --> 00:53:41,012
Are you mad at me?

410
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:51,040
Because I raised my vail? Is
that what bothered you? What?

411
00:53:53,032 --> 00:53:58,044
- Nothing. Just don't talk.
- I wanna know what.

412
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:07,016
As you wish. I just
don't wanna see you upset.

413
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,072
Is tie's fault?

414
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:22,031
You don't wanna wear a
tie in our wedding?

415
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:26,063
There must be something wrong.

416
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:24,000
- Tell me what you want.
- Goodbye.

417
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,087
I didn'do anything!

418
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:10,024
I didn't do anything!

419
00:59:12,068 --> 00:59:15,072
Why are you taking me?

420
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:33,071
Stop! Take
the kids inside!

421
01:00:20,056 --> 01:00:22,068
Hello, Hussein.

422
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:27,059
One moment.
I'll bring the box.

423
01:00:27,092 --> 01:00:30,044
Can I have a light please?

424
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:39,056
Go out of the way,
you skinny bastard!

425
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:46,004
How you're doing?
With all this cold?

426
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:50,031
I'm tough.
I can tolerate anything!

427
01:00:50,088 --> 01:00:53,040
- Nice shoes.
- Very stylish right?

428
01:00:53,072 --> 01:00:57,000
- Aren't they a bit small?
- A bit large you mean.

429
01:00:57,052 --> 01:00:59,059
Have you tried them on?

430
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:04,072
Reza said, the bigger
the better.

431
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:08,036
Small shoes and small
women are always bad news!

432
01:01:12,076 --> 01:01:15,059
- Are they expensive?
- Do you like them?

433
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:18,036
- How much did the cost?
- Not much.

434
01:01:19,003 --> 01:01:23,016
If you paid a bit more you
could buy a pair like mine.

435
01:01:24,016 --> 01:01:25,012
Really?

436
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:32,000
Let me see...
You bought them from the bazaar?

437
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:38,000
- You can't find another pair.
- Take them out! They're dirty!

438
01:01:38,047 --> 01:01:41,083
The more expensive,
the better.

439
01:01:42,019 --> 01:01:45,036
- The look nice on you.
- Thanks.

440
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,016
I'm late. I'm gone.

441
01:01:55,016 --> 01:01:59,019
Have you seen his girlfriend?...
very beautiful.

442
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:02,083
She came by last night,

443
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:05,008
Everybody went crazy!

444
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,079
They were so surpised!
He came on his bike.

445
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,043
A ferrari would be more suitable for her!
What a pity!

446
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:39,039
Some people are more lucky than others.
One in a million is as worthy.

447
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:42,060
- Men also!
- One in a million is a positive thought!

448
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:47,007
Ali is so lucky that
has you as a groom.

449
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:50,052
- Are you kidding me?
- Not at all.

450
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:57,048
Is that my order?

451
01:02:59,047 --> 01:03:02,051
Don't you forget the money.

452
01:03:04,052 --> 01:03:06,019
Thanks. I'm off.

453
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:14,096
I told you to write better.
I can't read a damn thing.

454
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:20,036
Zaferani, Building A.
You want me to read the number for you too?

455
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:28,043
Yes. How many?...
Hussein. Wait.

456
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:31,043
How many, you said?

457
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:36,043
Once more for
Zaferani.

458
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,076
I didn't see that. I was there
when they were taking him away.

459
01:04:23,032 --> 01:04:26,059
- What did they say?
- He's in a bad situation.

460
01:04:27,032 --> 01:04:30,004
I'll go visit him
after work.

461
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:50,007
Where are you taking this?
Give me that shoe!

462
01:04:56,003 --> 01:04:58,096
Show some mercy!

463
01:06:30,096 --> 01:06:35,059
- A delivery for Mr. Nakahi.
- He's waiting. 18th floor.

464
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:37,087
The elevator?
- To the right.

465
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,072
Mr. Nakahi?...
I brought the pizzas.

466
01:08:10,088 --> 01:08:12,044
Bu the girls are gone.

467
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:17,015
- I came as soon as you called me.
- What am I supposed to do with them?

468
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:22,003
- You ordered them?
- Yes, for two sluts!

469
01:08:22,072 --> 01:08:24,092
The city of madness!

470
01:08:30,091 --> 01:08:33,067
Are they gone?

471
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:39,087
The two girls I mean...
Are you sure? You've seen them?

472
01:08:48,064 --> 01:08:52,084
Sorry. I don't get it...
what do I owe you?

473
01:08:55,091 --> 01:08:57,039
It's the city of madness!

474
01:08:57,068 --> 01:09:01,052
That slut came, but she
brought a friend with her.

475
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:05,036
The came and the left...
I don't get it.

476
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:09,072
That's for you.

477
01:09:10,095 --> 01:09:13,067
I don't want them.
You can keep them.

478
01:09:14,028 --> 01:09:18,064
- Three pizzas for me alone?
- I'm alone too.

479
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:23,076
Let's eat together then.

480
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:29,031
I can't. I've got work to do.
- In the midnight?

481
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:35,095
Everything is closed. I'm hungry
myself. Let's eat together.

482
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:40,036
I wanna talk.
I'm so depressed.

483
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,083
Come on in.
Don't be shy.

484
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:50,032
How fo you live in this damn city?
That's the city of madness.

485
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:53,003
Μη βγάζεις τα παπούτσια!

486
01:09:54,011 --> 01:09:58,079
Unbelievable! I just seen her a couple of times
and she was preparing for a wedding allready.

487
01:09:59,015 --> 01:10:04,011
She's nuts! I was with someone
for 5 years, when I was there.

488
01:10:04,055 --> 01:10:08,047
Five years and never talked
about getting married!

489
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:11,036
I put so much effort
in cooking something.

490
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:14,079
And what does she say?
"Let's order some pizzas!"

491
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,032
Don't stand in the way.
Let them fuck themselves! Sit down.

492
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:27,000
- Here? Like this?
- Just forget it. Make yourself comfortable.

493
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:31,051
- Bathroom?
- On the back, to your right.

494
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:41,020
She wanted to be here.
And she showed up with a friend of hers!

495
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:45,023
They got themselves locked in the bathroom
and then they just left...

496
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:51,051
Why did they come after all? I was so
damn tired trying to make a proper meal!

497
01:10:56,055 --> 01:10:59,043
- Are they here?
- Why? What's wrong?

498
01:10:59,076 --> 01:11:02,024
- There is blood.
- Where?

499
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:12,076
You damn dump fucks! They left the
moment they got out of that fucking bathroom.

500
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:17,007
They can't even solve a
biological problem!

501
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,047
They fill their bag with
cosmetics, instead of...

502
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:26,051
...filling them with something
usefull for their shitty lives!

503
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:30,003
Go to the bathroom upstairs.
I must clean here.

504
01:11:31,072 --> 01:11:33,076
Plus, they're gone!

505
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:39,027
"My parents don't approve
this kind of contacts."

506
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:45,024
Sorry. I used
your stuff.

507
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:50,039
- I was so dirty.
- Don't you worry.

508
01:13:53,007 --> 01:13:57,023
- Is this your appartment?
- Of course not.

509
01:13:57,095 --> 01:14:01,075
It's my parents.
I just live here.

510
01:14:02,055 --> 01:14:06,063
To be exact, I just "rot" in here...
Sit donw, let's get to know each other.

511
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:10,019
What's your name?...
My name is Purang.

512
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:21,079
- Where are your parents?
- In the US. I was there too.

513
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,011
But I got nostalgia. I'm back
now, and I'm feeling a total stranger.

514
01:14:27,051 --> 01:14:31,043
Noone understands me. They
are different, weird.

515
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:34,083
Doing the simplest of the conversations...

516
01:14:35,043 --> 01:14:40,028
...while trying to talk, I feel
I am talking to a wall.

517
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:47,024
Everyone is pervert here.
You are pervert!

518
01:14:49,043 --> 01:14:52,015
- Why don't you eat something?
- You?

519
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:55,031
I lost my appetite.
I'd rather talk.

520
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:59,043
As for the bathroom...
We made a mistake.

521
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:03,024
I wish it was what I believed in the
first place. It'd made some sense.

522
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:10,019
Now... My head is
gonna burst!

523
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:15,047
- What was it?
- Red nail varnish.

524
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:21,076
She did her nails!
I don't get it.

525
01:15:23,011 --> 01:15:27,027
It's horrible. You get it now?
They are horrible!

526
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,020
- You got some water?
- I'll get some.

527
01:15:32,064 --> 01:15:34,092
I'm glad you listen to me.

528
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:42,000
Someone is marrying and his
wife ain't a virgin.

529
01:15:42,055 --> 01:15:46,071
He pretends nothing is wrong.
The marriage isn't ruined...

530
01:15:47,028 --> 01:15:51,056
Next morning she hears her
screaming out loud.

531
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:57,059
She goes up to her to check what's wrong.
Her ears are getting pierced.

532
01:15:58,055 --> 01:16:02,095
It wasn't exactly the place
that needed "piercing".

533
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:06,096
Should she do her
nails in my bathroom?

534
01:16:19,064 --> 01:16:22,076
- Do you listen to me, Hussein?
- Yes.

535
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,043
You didn't laugh.

536
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,028
My mouth was full.

537
01:16:46,028 --> 01:16:48,088
You find something interesting?

538
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:52,083
I'm looking for my house.

539
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,064
I've never seen the city from this high.
It must be somewhere there.

540
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:04,064
You stop hearring.
It's ok.

541
01:17:04,095 --> 01:17:09,003
You wanna see the city?
Go upstairs.

542
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:13,028
I was exactly like that
the first time.

543
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:19,051
Nice view! My father
was building the house for 4 years.

544
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:26,007
He stayed for 4 months
and then he left us.

545
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,036
This is what I mean
when I say you're weird.

546
01:17:30,087 --> 01:17:33,007
So many rooms...
For two people only...

547
01:17:42,068 --> 01:17:44,083
It's her. I can feel it.

548
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:50,007
She calls and she doesn't talk at all.
I can't believe it!

549
01:17:50,051 --> 01:17:53,031
They call and they don't talk.

550
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
- Eat!
- I lost my apettite!

551
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:01,043
I'm definite it's her.

552
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:05,019
Say something!

553
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:13,027
Why don't you say something?...
I know it's you.

554
01:18:15,072 --> 01:18:18,047
If you're not talking, hang up.

555
01:18:23,068 --> 01:18:25,076
Why don't you say something.

556
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:29,007
Say something!

557
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:49,019
Listen to me!
I beg you...

558
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:55,032
Stop calling me...
Or talk! It's you!

559
01:18:56,051 --> 01:19:00,055
Do you hear me?...
Why are you doing this?

560
01:19:02,011 --> 01:19:04,059
What's this game?
I know it's you.

561
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:10,032
Your pizzas are here.
I didn't eat them.

562
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,003
Do you hear me?
Take a cab and come over.

563
01:19:16,032 --> 01:19:20,060
Do you want to sent one?
Do you hear me?

564
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:25,087
Fuck! She hung up!

565
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:30,047
- Can I smoke?
- Yeah, I'll do a fag myself.

566
01:19:31,064 --> 01:19:34,016
- What kinda cigarettes are these?
- '57 brand

567
01:19:34,091 --> 01:19:38,027
- They're heavy.
- Yeah, for me too.

568
01:19:39,036 --> 01:19:42,020
- You want something lighter?
Nah, it's ok.

569
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:49,003
I forgot to offer you before...
I've got some booze on the fridge.

570
01:19:49,055 --> 01:19:55,007
I don't drink. You?
Here, men do drink... a lot.

571
01:19:55,043 --> 01:19:57,095
They drink just for the idea.

572
01:19:58,028 --> 01:20:04,064
I need environment,
some occasion.

573
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,016
I don't get it...
You can find almost everything in this fridge!

574
01:20:14,028 --> 01:20:16,003
Wait.

575
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:24,087
She's talking at last!

576
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:29,007
No. No-one is here.

577
01:20:29,076 --> 01:20:31,055
I'm alone, yes.

578
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:37,032
I told you. Get
the pizza out of the fridge.

579
01:20:43,068 --> 01:20:47,064
You talk too much. Let's not argue any
more... Come back here.

580
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:51,019
We'll talk when you're here.

581
01:20:54,076 --> 01:20:57,083
I haven't invited you before,
you came by yourself.

582
01:21:03,047 --> 01:21:09,023
Come back and we'll talk...
Come back, I said!

583
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:20,056
Ok, it was me.
I invited your friend.

584
01:21:22,072 --> 01:21:25,087
I told you, it was me.

585
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:30,011
Forget about it...

586
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:37,047
You didn't eat. Neither did I.
Let's eat together.

587
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:43,043
Come back.
Let's talk about it.

588
01:21:52,095 --> 01:21:55,095
Listen...

589
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:04,039
Why don't you just listen?
The night I met you...

590
01:22:05,015 --> 01:22:09,067
I was about to shave
my beard.

591
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:15,012
But you said I
look like Shakespeare.

592
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:20,031
I kept one for you.

593
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:48,068
- Who are you?
- Where are the jewels?

594
01:29:48,095 --> 01:29:53,035
- What jewels?
- The ones in the window upfront...

595
01:29:53,076 --> 01:29:57,024
What do you want? Why
are you doing this?

596
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:00,068
- Where are the jewels?
- What are you doing?

597
01:30:00,095 --> 01:30:05,059
- I'll kill you!
- Why? Don't do it, please!

598
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:12,039
Where do you think you're going?...
Where are they?

599
01:30:13,072 --> 01:30:17,024
The blue ring...
from the window upfront.

600
01:30:18,055 --> 01:30:21,019
- Stop!
- Where is it?

601
01:30:22,051 --> 01:30:25,055
- Where have you put it?
- In the vault!

602
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:28,011
- And where is that vault?
- Downstairs!

603
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:34,004
- Let's go downstairs then!
- You're making a terrible mistake!
