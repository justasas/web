1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:03,701
(soft guitar music)

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,180
- Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,327
What happened?

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,647
I just can't deal with him anymore.

5
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,333
- Don't even know what to do, eh?

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,166
Kill him.

7
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:26,675
You know who I miss?

8
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:27,508
- Who?

9
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:28,341
- John Paul.

10
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:29,666
- John Paul, like the pope?

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,498
- Yeah.

12
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,515
- Why?

13
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:32,347
- I don't know.

14
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:34,774
Everybody liked him, seemed
like an alright dude.

15
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:35,607
- I guess.

16
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,626
But I'm not buying it, Alex,
you're not even religious.

17
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:39,931
- Just 'cause I'm not
religious doesn't mean that,

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,975
you know, I can't find somebody not cool.

19
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:43,808
- I don't know.

20
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:46,394
What, uh, Pope Francis
doesn't cut it for you?

21
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:48,454
- He does but he's no John Paul,

22
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:50,465
that's what I'm trying to say.

23
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:51,755
- Honestly, I don't give a fuck.

24
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:55,075
The only Paul I've ever
missed is Sean Paul.

25
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:57,707
- Well Pope Sean Paul,
now that's a good idea.

26
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,206
- Right, Pope Sean Paul.

27
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,166
Just Gimme the Light, you know.

28
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:02,138
- Yeah, you can make t-shirts.

29
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:04,206
You could vote for him.

30
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:05,899
- [Frank ] You'd vote for Paul?

31
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,064
- I'm pretty sure that's
how they weigh it, right?

32
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:09,855
- I don't know, I just
know they smoke and shit.

33
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:10,882
All of 'em.
- Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:13,066
(cheerful music)

35
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,757
- [Frank] Hey, can I
get a bacon and cheese?

36
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:16,578
- I'll take a Caesar salad.

37
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,467
- What the fuck?

38
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,301
- What?

39
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,754
I'm on a diet.

40
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:21,221
- So you ask the guy
that makes you sandwiches

41
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:22,329
for a Caesar salad?

42
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,480
- Well you never had his Caesar salads.

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,927
Trust me, they're killer.

44
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:28,710
- I guess so, still makes you a bitch.

45
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,353
- Well am I gonna be a bitch

46
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:32,792
when I'm on the beach with my six pack?

47
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,543
And you're gonna be here bitchin'.

48
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:35,376
- No.
- You should try.

49
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,400
You should have some of these salads.

50
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,293
- Yeah, we'll fucking see about that.

51
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:40,873
You and your six pack.

52
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:44,134
God, I mean, stop fucking dreaming.

53
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:45,635
Oh, what are you gonna do today?

54
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:48,276
- Eh, same old, get drunk.

55
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,947
- Christ, you're a fucking alcoholic.

56
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:51,805
- Well, you know, you love it.

57
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:52,801
- Your liver doesn't.

58
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,042
- Ah, fuck my liver.

59
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,893
I don't need 'em.

60
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:57,634
- I think you can't, they're important.

61
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,608
- Yeah, I guess so.

62
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,940
- Fuck, I gotta work today.

63
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,301
- Oh, oh yeah?

64
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,840
- Yeah.
- You work?

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,189
- What the fuck was that?

66
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:06,058
- What was what?

67
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:06,891
Work?

68
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:07,724
- Yeah.

69
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:09,899
- Nothing, don't worry about it.

70
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,225
- Fuck you man, work is work, you know.

71
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,638
- You give out flyers to people.

72
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,087
- Hey, I work in marketing.

73
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:17,097
- Oh, yeah?

74
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,420
You give out pieces of paper to people

75
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,930
that just throw it out immediately.

76
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:24,126
- Fuck you man, a job is a job, you know.

77
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,640
I'm on rough times.

78
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,853
- Oh yeah, 'cause your
girlfriend cheated on you, right?

79
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:30,336
And you lost your job, boohoo hoo.

80
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:31,539
- Hey, I don't complain that much.

81
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,478
You know, I'm just going
through rough times.

82
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,312
- Yeah you're not.

83
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:35,925
- I'm trying to get back on my feet.

84
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,076
- You're not going through rough times.

85
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:40,212
You know Sid Murphy, now he's
going through rough times.

86
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,007
- Who the fuck is Sid Murphy?

87
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,236
- Ah, my old friend from
high school, you know,

88
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:47,567
he's homeless, smokes a lot of dog shit.

89
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,400
- Dog shit?

90
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,564
- Too much.

91
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:50,397
It's dog shit.

92
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:51,230
- People do that?

93
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,843
They smoke dog shit?
- Well he does.

94
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:53,676
He's homeless.

95
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:54,509
- Ah, okay.
- What else is he gonna smoke?

96
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,574
- I guess that would be a
reason why he smokes dog shit.

97
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:58,074
- The only reason.

98
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,000
- Weird.

99
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:04,941
Thanks.

100
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,553
Man, I don't want to go to
work today, I'm exhausted.

101
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,533
- So don't.

102
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,242
- I have to, I have to make paper bro.

103
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:19,491
- Ah, alright, well, then go.

104
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,385
- Yeah, I'm gonna have to.

105
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,423
I'm just so fucking tired from yesterday.

106
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:24,539
- From all that drinking, all those 40s.

107
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,632
- Yeah, it's just those
40s were calling me.

108
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:28,397
- I don't know, yeah,
it's a good workout too,

109
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:29,799
holding those 40s all night.

110
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,873
- Ah, yeah, but then it's like a catch-22.

111
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,639
You're working out,

112
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,551
but then you're also
drinking a bunch of beer.

113
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,444
Calories, man.

114
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,013
- Ah, yes.
- Now, I'm sitting too?

115
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:40,409
- Empty calories.

116
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,758
Well you could have burned some calories

117
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:42,913
fingering that girl.

118
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:43,849
- What do you mean?

119
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,846
- You remember that girl?

120
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:46,808
- [Frank] Really?

121
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:48,085
- Yeah, remember.

122
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:50,588
She was like oh I totally
want Frank to finger me,

123
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,210
but you was doing 40 hands.

124
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,393
So she fell asleep, unsatisfied.

125
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,390
- Fuck.

126
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,981
You think she still wants to get fingered?

127
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,539
- Well, she's kind of sleeping right now.

128
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,602
- Well like, I could wake her and ask.

129
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:03,689
- Nah, you know, just
leave her, let her sleep.

130
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:04,521
- [Frank] Yeah, you know what?

131
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:05,556
When she's 100%.
- When she leaves.

132
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,278
- Yeah, you know what,
actually, when she wakes up,

133
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:08,781
you ask her, let me know,

134
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,253
'cause now I feel like quite an asshole.

135
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,085
- Yeah, you should.

136
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,893
- I could have provided, and I didn't.

137
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:14,134
Who is she anyway?

138
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,715
- I don't know, she came
with this guy right here.

139
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,006
- Who is that guy?

140
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:17,838
- Don't you know?

141
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:18,672
- No.

142
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:19,618
- Yeah, I don't know who that is.

143
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,057
- Maybe he fingered her.

144
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,366
- Maybe she fingered him.

145
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:23,927
- Maybe they fingered together.

146
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:24,788
That's why they're on the floor.

147
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,048
- Maybe they just laid
down and fell asleep.

148
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:28,108
You ever think about that?

149
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:31,999
- Well I only invited
people to this party.

150
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:31,834
Didn't you hear?

151
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,002
I was like hey we're
having a finger party.

152
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:34,312
- [Alex] Yeah, I didn't get fingered.

153
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,591
I didn't finger anybody either.

154
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,723
- It's about that time.

155
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:38,622
- Ah, about that time, huh?

156
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:39,658
- About that time.

157
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:40,827
- To go to work.

158
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:41,661
- Yeah.

159
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:43,800
- Eh.
- Fuck you.

160
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,879
- Oh, have fun.

161
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,267
(upbeat music)

162
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,790
- Nope, we don't sell beepers anymore.

163
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,153
Like phones and stuff.

164
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:55,356
Okay, I'm sorry.

165
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:56,554
I'm sorry we don't fucking do it.

166
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:57,524
I mean we don't do that.

167
00:04:57,524 --> 00:04:59,137
I'm sorry for saying, I'm sorry.

168
00:04:59,137 --> 00:04:59,970
Okay.

169
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:04,276
Where you fucking first sent your bitch.

170
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:06,382
Hi.

171
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:07,215
- [Frank] Hey.

172
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,482
- Thanks for showing
up, you're fucking late.

173
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:10,512
- I'm not, what are you talking about?

174
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,095
It's 12 on the dot.

175
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,159
- 12 on the what?

176
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,603
- 12 on the dot.

177
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:16,918
- The fuck is that?

178
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,596
- It's an expression, like 12 on the dot,

179
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:19,461
I mean I'll be there.

180
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,781
- I've never heard that
in my fucking life.

181
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,615
- It's not my fault.

182
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,795
- 12 on the nose.

183
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:24,628
- On the nose?

184
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:25,979
- 12 on the head.

185
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,125
- Never heard of that.

186
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,281
- A needle in the head.

187
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:30,728
- Hit the needle on the head.
- Hit the needle on head?

188
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:31,725
- Needle in a haystack.

189
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:33,997
- That has nothing to do with time.

190
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:36,558
- I know phrases, I never
heard of the fucking dot shit.

191
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,099
- I don't think you know phrases,

192
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,616
'cause you never heard of on the dot.

193
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:40,575
Now you got lemons.

194
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,408
What's with the lemons?

195
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,088
- This is what life gave me.

196
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,088
I would love it.

197
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,728
I would love if I could just simply just

198
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,782
open up a lemonade stand and
not have to sell this shit.

199
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,567
But this is, this is what life gives me.

200
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,066
- Oh yeah, like the expression?

201
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:53,961
When life hands you lemons.

202
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:54,862
- [Escalon Boss] What happens?

203
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:55,999
- You make lemonade.

204
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,534
Are you gonna make lemonade?

205
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,397
- Life hands you lemons, you get laid.

206
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:01,838
You're fucking making shit up.

207
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:05,486
I never heard of that shit
in my fucking life man.

208
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:06,512
- [Frank] That's a thing.

209
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:07,345
- Alright.

210
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:08,424
Just hand out some flyers man.

211
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,447
If you could do that, that
would be fucking terrific.

212
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:11,340
- Alright, I'm gonna go.

213
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,682
- It would be like a
glass of fucking lemonade.

214
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:14,201
- Alright.

215
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,035
I'm gonna go give out.

216
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,734
- Extra sugar.

217
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:17,902
- I'm gonna go give out the flyer.

218
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,019
- Do that, thank you, thank you.

219
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,879
- I'll be back.
- Thank you.

220
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,296
Fucking shit man.

221
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:28,617
Fucking three o'clock,

222
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:32,239
I gotta fucking peel all these lemons.

223
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,072
Fuck!

224
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:36,830
I need the lemon.

225
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,012
Fucking shit.

226
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:39,646
Fuck it, fuck it.

227
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:40,480
It doesn't matter.

228
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,664
Kill me, just fucking kill me.

229
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,413
Just fucking kill me.

230
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,987
- [Frank] Can I have a cell phone?

231
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:48,820
- What?

232
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,826
("Tongue in the Dirt" by Generation Pill)

233
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:10,324
♫ Hey man can I get a ride home

234
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:17,192
♫ Acid on my eyes and in my bones

235
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:23,905
♫ Feeling dirty feeling people stare

236
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:30,494
♫ Care to take me almost anywhere but here

237
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,521
♫ Anywhere but here

238
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:42,992
♫ Anywhere but here

239
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:45,903
♫ Anywhere but here

240
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,153
♫ But here

241
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,514
- Hey man, what's this?

242
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:12,347
- Surprise.

243
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:13,748
- Fuck.

244
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,088
I haven't seen you in like forever,

245
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,058
and you lost a ton of weight.

246
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:20,391
- Yeah, well there's not too
many White Castles in Ohio.

247
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,511
- Well what's up, you don't
text me, you don't call.

248
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,798
- Well I tried calling you

249
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,497
but I guess I have your old number.

250
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:26,760
But I heard you were
giving out flyers again

251
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,228
so I'd thought I come check you out.

252
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:30,062
- Well it's not like this
is all I've been doing

253
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,124
for the past four years while
you were away at college.

254
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:33,341
You know, I've done other stuff.

255
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,323
It's just I fucking lost my job.

256
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,708
- Look, I didn't say anything.

257
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,879
- It's just really fucking
great to have you back.

258
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,600
Are you staying long?

259
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,750
- Uh, maybe, I don't know.

260
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,080
But where's Hailey?

261
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,081
I'd like to see her.

262
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,663
- Well, about that.

263
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,902
- So she just up and left you like that?

264
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:52,972
With who?

265
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,981
- Yo, fucking Danny.

266
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:57,135
It's 'cause he had a sweet car.

267
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,425
- Yeah, that's right, he did get

268
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,267
a lot of girls with that sweet car.

269
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,667
- Yeah, it was a sweet car,

270
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,685
and they drove out of the fucking state.

271
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:05,106
- Where'd they go?

272
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:08,274
- I believe they moved to Connecticut.

273
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,343
- Well, fuck her and her Connecticunt.

274
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,574
- [Frank] Oh, good one bro.

275
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:13,646
- Not my best.

276
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:16,276
- [Frank] Yeah, I think they're
pregnant now, well, she is.

277
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:17,577
- [Dave] Who'd you hear that from?

278
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,803
- Her mother, I ran
into her the other day.

279
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:20,636
- What?

280
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,550
It just doesn't seem like
something Hailey would do.

281
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:26,557
- Well, you know, it just.

282
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,451
- Well I don't know actually.

283
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:29,706
- Yeah, it's fine.

284
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:32,046
So, how was the college life?

285
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:34,498
Went to any interesting frats?

286
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:37,174
- Almost, but once they
found that I was gay,

287
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,491
they didn't want me
naked in their basement

288
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,227
getting paddled, so no frats for me.

289
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,875
- Ah, well there must have
been some cool parties.

290
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,744
- A few.

291
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:46,574
- No Project X style parties?

292
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,682
- No, I went to college, not high school.

293
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,711
- Well sorry, Mr. Harvard.

294
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:52,043
- Shut up.

295
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,875
- Well, what are you gonna do now?

296
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:56,892
- I don't know.

297
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:59,992
I mean, I applied to a few
jobs, maybe grad school,

298
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,402
but a lot of that stuff is really scary.

299
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,312
- I didn't mean like
in your fucking future.

300
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,190
I meant like right now.

301
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,591
What are you gonna do after this?

302
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:09,632
- Oh, um, well I gotta
say hi to my parents.

303
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,399
- Ah, fuck your parents.

304
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,241
- No, they're kind of cool.

305
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,240
- I guess.

306
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,375
Ah, well, we should do
this more, let's hang out.

307
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,510
- Yeah, definitely.

308
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,449
I mean, I gotta get
readjusted to city life so.

309
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,002
- I'll readjust you.

310
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:25,630
- Well, you have my number and just,

311
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,929
you know, call me when you wanna hang out.

312
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,190
- Yeah.
- But I gotta go now.

313
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,050
So, talk to you later.

314
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,080
- Yeah.
- All right, see ya.

315
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:34,293
Hug.

316
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:35,846
Okay, all right, all right, bye.

317
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:37,429
- I'll see you man.

318
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,162
- What's up?

319
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:48,745
- I saw Dave today.

320
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:49,598
- Matthews?

321
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,266
- No, Dave Matthews.

322
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,214
No, I saw my old friend.

323
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:54,548
I've told you about him.

324
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:55,604
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

325
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:56,865
Well, how is he?

326
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,543
- Oh, he's good, he
just got back from Ohio.

327
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:01,102
- Ah, Ohio.

328
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:02,323
What, is he gay?

329
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,480
- Actually, he is.

330
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,966
- Well I didn't mean it like that.

331
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,524
I'm not racist or anything.

332
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:09,193
- I think the term you're
looking for is homophobic.

333
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:11,246
- Well I'm not, all right.

334
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,400
It's cool that's he's gay.

335
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,990
It's probably the coolest.

336
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,401
- So kiss me.

337
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:17,890
- Ah, man, can you just finish your story

338
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,730
and stop trying to fuck me all the time?

339
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,759
- Oh, yeah, sure.

340
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,360
Um, no, he was just
talking about how he's back

341
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,138
and he wants to get readjusted
to city life, you know.

342
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:29,560
- Yeah, that's cool.

343
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,028
- Yeah, I guess.

344
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,605
- What you mean by I guess?

345
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:34,673
- Nothing, it's just, you know,

346
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,625
we haven't hung out in a long time.

347
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,408
- [Alex] So isn't it a good
thing you guys are hanging out?

348
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,057
- Yeah, yeah, it's great,
I'm not complaining.

349
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:44,920
- Look, I understand, I was
like you're complaining.

350
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,858
Oh, yeah, yeah, by the way, the other girl

351
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,990
that wanted to get fingered.

352
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,822
- [Frank] Yeah.

353
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:51,148
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

354
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,644
- Oh, wait, you got it done?

355
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,369
- Ah, not me, I asked somebody else to.

356
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:55,354
- [Frank] Oh, the other guy that was here.

357
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:56,937
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,642
- I've been meaning to bring up something.

359
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,475
- What?

360
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:03,125
- The other night I got in
my room, middle of the night,

361
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,076
and I heard something
coming from your room.

362
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:05,947
- Okay.

363
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:06,847
- I heard crying.

364
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,538
Were you crying?

365
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,121
- No, it wasn't me.

366
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:15,509
- I'm pretty sure I heard
you, I heard you crying.

367
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,928
There's nobody else in this apartment.

368
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:19,451
- Nah, it must have been
the TV, it wasn't me.

369
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,687
- Are you all right?

370
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:21,860
- Yeah, I'm fine.

371
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,035
The last time I cried was
at ending of Marmaduke.

372
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,683
You know that movie's too sad for me.

373
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:28,350
The ending kills me.

374
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:31,043
But no, wasn't me.

375
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:34,544
Well, I don't know.

376
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,971
I'm gonna head to bed.

377
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,608
- Oh, you mean you're
gonna go into bed and cry.

378
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:41,211
- Well, if I'm crying,
I'm watching Marmaduke.

379
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:42,567
You know that's my favorite movie man.

380
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:44,376
- I don't know why.

381
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,787
- [Alex] It's good.

382
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,440
- [Frank] Forgot something.

383
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,581
- [Alex] I like dogs.

384
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,581
- Yeah, I like dogs too.

385
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,519
- Ma, Amanda and her
sister are at it again.

386
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,351
Yeah, don't worry, I'll handle it.

387
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,769
Shoo, shoo.

388
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,168
Shoo, you two get out of
here, get out of here.

389
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,418
- The fuck, why'd you do that for?

390
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:47,865
- Man, trust me, don't worry about it.

391
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:48,698
- I am.

392
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,152
What, what was that?

393
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,894
- Those were my cousins.

394
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,894
Don't worry about it,
I'm just gonna go inside.

395
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:56,726
- Oh.

396
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,521
The fuck you do that for?

397
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,376
- 'Cause I fucking can, yo.

398
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:12,585
- You don't gotta be a dick man.

399
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,076
I'm just trying to work out here.

400
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:15,163
- This is what you call work?

401
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:15,995
- Yeah.

402
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,626
- You know how many six
figures I made last year?

403
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,488
- Six.

404
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,048
- 700,000 a year.

405
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:20,927
- Fucking congrats.

406
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,337
What you want me to say about that?

407
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,272
- Yo, you're making me
mad angry right now.

408
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:25,610
- You're not angry now.

409
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,723
- I'm about to give you a
fucking knuckle sandwich.

410
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:30,247
- Who the fuck even says knuckle sandwich?

411
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,165
- Oh, word.

412
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:35,653
(tense music)

413
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,920
- Who the fuck are you?

414
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,088
- I'm Will, your subconscious or whatever.

415
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:45,860
- Well I guess that's cool, whatever.

416
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,081
- What are you doing here?

417
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,161
- I got knocked out.

418
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,168
- Where?

419
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,509
- 47th and 7th.

420
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,076
- You better hope you don't get robbed.

421
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,605
- Yeah.

422
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:54,654
Wait, thinking about it now,

423
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:55,826
didn't you jump me a few times?

424
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:56,917
- Do you have hands?

425
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:59,280
- Ah, no problem, whatever.

426
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
- Who's that over there?

427
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:05,000
- Fuck you, Frank.

428
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,677
I'm fucking your girlfriend.

429
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,200
How does that feel?

430
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,367
Hanging out flyers while I
got the fucking Cadillac cash.

431
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,048
- That's Danny.

432
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,730
He ran off with my girlfriend Hailey.

433
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,821
Last I heard they're pregnant.

434
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:19,720
- Rough deal, man.

435
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,552
- Yeah.

436
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,529
- I got a fucking sweet car.

437
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,510
Me and your girlfriend
we ride around in it.

438
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,209
I already fucking bought like a baby seat

439
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,661
for the fucking baby.

440
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,209
His name's gonna be Hugo.

441
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,181
It's gonna be the fucking shit.

442
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,370
My life is awesome.

443
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,609
Your life sucks.

444
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:37,879
You have no balls.

445
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,390
Fuck you.

446
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,562
- Well, why is this my
subconscious anyway?

447
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,281
- Maybe because you
haven't gotten over it yet.

448
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,610
Seriously, how long has it been?

449
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,393
You're free to do whatever
and whomever you want.

450
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:49,810
Where are your balls?

451
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,141
- I don't know man, she took 'em.

452
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:53,422
- Exactly, get your balls back.

453
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,089
Get your balls back.

454
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,268
- I guess I better get
my balls back, right?

455
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:02,125
- Wow, they're really getting
hot and heavy over there.

456
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,792
- Oh, I can feel it kicking, oh.

457
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:10,041
Hailey's sucking my dick right now.

458
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:20,717
- And that's what a
prolapsed asshole looks like.

459
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,093
- So this is what you've
been doing since I left?

460
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,259
- Not exactly.

461
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,413
Aw fuck I hate this job.

462
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,303
- What happened?

463
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:38,754
- I don't know, some macho man came over

464
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:40,125
and clocked me in the face.

465
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,465
- Why?

466
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:42,939
- I don't know, maybe he don't like me

467
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:44,876
or maybe he just really wanted to fuck me

468
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,756
and all he knows is violence.

469
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,036
- Yeah, I doubt it.

470
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,677
- Well what are you doing here?

471
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:50,920
- Just going to the deli.

472
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,930
- To get what?

473
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,000
- Caesar salad.

474
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,039
- Why the fuck is everybody getting

475
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,456
Caesar salads from delis now, since when?

476
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,612
- So you wanna come over?

477
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,083
- Don't your parents like hate me?

478
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,197
- Doesn't everybody hate you?

479
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:06,629
- Yes, that's true.

480
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,463
- [Both] Ah, let's go.

481
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,490
- Hey, so who do you think
would win in a fight?

482
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,698
Sam Jackson in The Avengers,
or Sam Jackson in Jungle Fever?

483
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:22,071
- Oh, Jungle Fever, no question about it.

484
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,561
He's got that crazy
crackhead dancing going on,

485
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,531
and Nick Fury's blind.

486
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:28,313
- Yeah, like that never
comes up in the movie.

487
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,240
It's like you think somebody
would throw something

488
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,143
at Nick Fury and he wouldn't
be able to catch it.

489
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:36,066
- Well like, the Avengers
wanna go out one night

490
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,634
and see a 3D movie.

491
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,953
- Yeah, like fuck Nick Fury.

492
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:41,394
- He should just get a glass eye.

493
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,340
- Well, everybody should
just get a glass eye.

494
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,748
- I should see how much those cost.

495
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:49,354
- [Frank] Hey, have you ever
seen a prolapsed asshole?

496
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:50,658
- Dude, I'm eating.

497
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:51,490
- [Frank] What?

498
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,338
I'm just asking.

499
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,219
- Yeah.

500
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,052
- Ew, how?

501
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,293
- College party.

502
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,975
- Well, was there just
some girl running around

503
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,247
flaunting her prolapsed asshole?

504
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,449
- It's not too far from the truth.

505
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:05,282
- Ew.

506
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:08,878
- Could I ask you a question about Hailey?

507
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,236
- [Frank] Ask away.

508
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:12,249
- How long ago was it?

509
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:14,679
- [Frank] About seven months ago.

510
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,519
- It's just she never told me about it

511
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,638
and we were all best friends,

512
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,718
so I figured she would
text me or something.

513
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,370
- Dude, don't worry
about it, don't feel bad,

514
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,279
like she dropped everybody and just left.

515
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,820
- Let's just go to Connecticut
and slash her tires.

516
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,531
- Now that doesn't sound
like too bad of an idea.

517
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:34,742
- You guys were dating
for such a long time.

518
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,423
- Yeah, five years.

519
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,371
- Seems like forever.

520
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,300
- Yeah, I know Dave.

521
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,299
- Oh, sorry.

522
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,459
Touchy subject.

523
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,293
- Eh.

524
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:46,318
- But why though?

525
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:47,719
It was seven months ago.

526
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,580
Get your balls back.

527
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,759
- Huh, that's strange.

528
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,218
You're not the only person
who said that to me today.

529
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:56,086
- 'Cause it's true, that you
gotta get your balls back man.

530
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:58,838
Look, Saturday we'll go out.

531
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,777
You show me what I've been missing

532
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,115
and I'll get your balls back.

533
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:02,964
- I don't know, man.

534
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:04,336
I haven't seen those in ages.

535
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,076
They are probably all dusty and lonely.

536
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,992
- Lonely, lonely balls.

537
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,423
Are you watching porn?

538
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:14,842
- Dude, I really wanna
see a prolapsed asshole.

539
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:17,673
- What's with your new obsession
with prolapsed assholes?

540
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,749
- I don't know, it's intriguing.

541
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:21,923
- [Porn Actress] Fucking tease that shit.

542
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:22,810
- [Porn Actress] Uh-huh.

543
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,810
- [Porn Actress] Uh-huh.

544
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:29,382
- So I guess my Mom doesn't like

545
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:32,182
prolapsed assholes as much as you do.

546
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,345
- Who knew?

547
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,721
- Anyways, Saturday still sounds cool?

548
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:36,614
- Yeah.

549
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:37,980
- All right.

550
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,278
We're gonna get your balls back.

551
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,171
- No matter what, my balls will be found.

552
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,004
- All right.

553
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:43,195
- I'll see you later.

554
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:47,362
("Sheet City" by Mannequin Pussy)

555
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:04,054
What the fuck are you doing?

556
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,782
- Oh, what's up, Frank?

557
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,114
- [Frank] Yeah, so what are you doing?

558
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,804
- I was just trying to
fit these in my mouth.

559
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,823
- Yeah, but why are you shoving fucking

560
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:13,134
toilet paper rolls in your mouth?

561
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,505
- All right, yesterday I was out,

562
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,915
I don't know if you know that or not.

563
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,624
- I don't care.

564
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:18,457
- Fair enough.

565
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,607
I was with some girl and you know,

566
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,982
we were just hanging out, all
of this, all that good stuff.

567
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:24,034
- Yeah man, okay.

568
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:26,208
- You know, I've known her
for a while, long enough.

569
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,041
- Long enough?

570
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,303
- Yeah, long enough.

571
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:30,054
So I paid for her, I paid for everything.

572
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,752
I paid for everything.

573
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:35,056
I just asked for a
simple and quick blowjob.

574
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,595
Didn't get anything.

575
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:38,315
- Ah, classic Alex.

576
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:39,990
You never get blowjobs.

577
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,961
- [Alex] You might have guessed that.

578
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,910
Probably from every other story.

579
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,508
- Every story you tell me,

580
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,296
it ends hey I didn't get that blowjob.

581
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:47,846
- So she was telling me.

582
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:48,790
- [Frank] Yeah.

583
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,259
- Well she was going on
a rant, first of all,

584
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:53,579
about how hard it was to give a blowjob.

585
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:54,888
Yeah, it was very annoying.

586
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:59,187
She was going on for five
minutes, felt like a whole night.

587
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:01,239
So she told me to get a
bunch of toilet paper rolls,

588
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,876
which is what I have right now,

589
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:05,118
and just shove it in my mouth.

590
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:06,096
- [Frank] Why?

591
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:08,771
- Well to show to see how it feels.

592
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,307
- [Frank] To give a blowjob?

593
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:11,141
- Yeah.

594
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,619
And it's probably one of the
hardest things I've ever done.

595
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:15,452
- Really?

596
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:16,825
- Yeah, it's very uncomfortable.

597
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,207
- That's probably why
they don't like to do it.

598
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,959
Like so you just got up in
the morning, decided hey.

599
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,091
- [Alex] Well I was up all night.

600
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,923
- All night just thinking?

601
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:25,491
- Thinking about it, it was killing me.

602
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:27,364
It was, it was bad.

603
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:30,092
Dude, do you wanna try it?

604
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:31,350
- I guess.

605
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:32,388
Nah.

606
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:33,609
Why don't you just give me a dry one?

607
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,221
I don't want one you just sucked off.

608
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,211
- All of them are.

609
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,732
- No, that's fucking weird man.

610
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:39,364
Just I don't wanna do that.

611
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,265
Why are you doing this?

612
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,004
- Okay, first of all,
you're making it weird.

613
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:43,232
Second of all, all of these are wet.

614
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:44,942
None of them are dry so
you're not gonna have any.

615
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:47,183
- Well, go fucking, why did you waste

616
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,106
all our toilet paper doing this?

617
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:51,906
- What else am I supposed to do?

618
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:52,858
- Not do this.

619
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,213
Watch the fucking TV.

620
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,237
Why are you sucking off?

621
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:57,033
You're just oh, I'm gonna
wake up this morning,

622
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,423
I'm gonna face fuck a
bunch of toilet paper.

623
00:21:58,423 --> 00:21:59,352
- Yes.

624
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,480
I thought about this last night

625
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,490
when she blurted out, I thought about it,

626
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,422
and that's what I wanted
to do all day today.

627
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,442
- Well are you gonna text her
and let her know how it feels?

628
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:07,276
- Uh, no.

629
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:11,815
- Hey, so I finished up.

630
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:13,523
I'm gonna head out now.

631
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:14,355
- You're all done?

632
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:15,374
That was fucking quick.

633
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:16,259
- [Frank] Not that fast.

634
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,402
- Where's Guinness World Records?

635
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,722
'Cause I think I gotta
put a record on that.

636
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:21,913
- [Frank] What do you mean?

637
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,114
- Nobody hands out flyers that fast, man.

638
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:27,394
It's almost like you just
fucking threw them out.

639
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:28,855
- What are you talking about?

640
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:31,266
- Hm, look at this picture.

641
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,045
- What's, what's that?

642
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,537
- Oh (mumbles).

643
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,620
Look at this.

644
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:37,311
You wanna explain that?

645
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,655
- That wasn't me.

646
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:39,734
- It wasn't you, you're the only

647
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,402
fucking person handing out flyers.

648
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,236
- All right.

649
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,069
- Did you think I'm not gonna see?

650
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,901
You fucking threw them
out right in the corner.

651
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:49,312
I go to lunch on that corner,
on that fucking block.

652
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:52,332
I see a garbage can full of our flyers.

653
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,464
- I had something
important to do that day.

654
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:56,403
- Important, you have something important.

655
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,043
Have you seen what I've fucking been

656
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,060
through this whole fucking week?

657
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,540
I got a lot of important things to do.

658
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
I got deadly shit to do.

659
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:09,797
This is not fucking like,
this is your job, bro.

660
00:23:09,797 --> 00:23:11,626
This is what you have to fucking do.

661
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:14,460
You gotta take responsibility man.

662
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:16,674
You know what?

663
00:23:16,674 --> 00:23:17,721
- I'll pay for the stack.

664
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,289
- That's not the fucking point man.

665
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,788
If I could just pay off my fucking,

666
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,069
fucking problems, my
issues, we're done son,

667
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,657
I wouldn't have to deal with shit.

668
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,525
But I got shit to deal with,

669
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:31,692
and you're not involved in
it, so just fucking leave.

670
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,884
Just take a few days, just take a few days

671
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,620
and just get out of my fucking face man.

672
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:38,813
- Are you firing me?

673
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:40,715
- No, I'm not.

674
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,297
I'm just giving you fucking time off.

675
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,826
If I need you, I'll call you.

676
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:48,317
- Dude, I won't do it again, I promise.

677
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:50,796
- Take some time, all right?

678
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,629
- Fuck.

679
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,634
(phone rings)

680
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,467
- Hello?

681
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,625
Yes, they're okay, they're good.

682
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,958
Okay, all right.

683
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:02,744
Yes, you'll have the lemons ready.

684
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:03,784
They're fucking peeled.

685
00:24:03,785 --> 00:24:06,538
You have them three, three on the head.

686
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:07,678
It's an impression.

687
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:11,065
Mm-hmm, infection, I don't know.

688
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:13,645
Listen, I'm sorry, okay, fuck, fuck.

689
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:14,673
We need hand chop.

690
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:17,223
We got like a fucking
shitload of lemons coming in.

691
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:21,253
Fuck man, I don't know what
to fucking do with this shit.

692
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,541
Fuck!

693
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,375
Fuck!

694
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:26,482
- Fuck.

695
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,481
- Fuck what?

696
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,811
- I think I just got fired.

697
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,541
- What do you mean you
think you got fired?

698
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,374
- I mean he told me, "Hey, don't come in

699
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,903
"for a couple of days,
I don't want you here."

700
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:39,339
Fuck, which means no money,

701
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:42,339
which means I'm fucking jobless man.

702
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:46,159
- Yeah, well, what are you gonna do now?

703
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,838
- I guess nothing, just hang around here

704
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,154
fucking doing what you do.

705
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,499
What do you fucking do?

706
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:51,332
- I do a lot.

707
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:53,336
- Yes, suck on fucking toilet paper rolls.

708
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:54,372
- It's productive, it's better than

709
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:55,441
what you're doing right now.

710
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:57,462
You're just sitting here bitching.

711
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,296
- Fuck.

712
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,502
Yeah, sorry.

713
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:03,201
It's just fucking, you know, like Dave

714
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,339
came back from college and I can't even.

715
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,738
He has a fucking degree.

716
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,896
I can't even fucking hand out paper.

717
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,878
- Well, giving out paper
is not for everybody.

718
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:15,955
- Fucking homeless people
can give out flyers, man.

719
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:19,482
- Well, if it makes you feel
any better, Torrie stopped by.

720
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:20,316
- Oh yeah?

721
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:21,490
- She was looking for you.

722
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,471
She looks pretty good.

723
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:24,653
- What does that even mean?

724
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,970
- Well, she looked nice,
she looked all dressed up.

725
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,038
She looked like she was
going out, you know.

726
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:32,278
- Man, I haven't seen her in forever.

727
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,878
- Well, maybe then you
should give her a call,

728
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:35,666
see what she's up to.

729
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,949
- Yeah, maybe.

730
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,421
- How about we, we walk to the park?

731
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:40,519
Take a little walk.

732
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,849
You know, that used to calm you down.

733
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,129
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

734
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,547
- Yeah, let's go.

735
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:55,012
You smell like lemon.

736
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,012
- Ah, it's a long story.

737
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,589
(screaming)

738
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:00,493
- I'm just kidding.

739
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:01,442
I'm just kidding.

740
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:02,834
How's it going man?

741
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:03,834
- Alex, man.

742
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,042
- How's it going guys?

743
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,476
- [Jimmy] As I live and breathe.

744
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:09,092
- [Alex] I went to high
school with these two guys.

745
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:09,925
- Oh.

746
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:10,935
- Yeah, we used to be best friends.

747
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:11,769
- Best friends, man.

748
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:12,638
- Best.
- Best.

749
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:13,555
I am Jimmy.

750
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:17,049
- [Frank] And this is.

751
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,071
Come on.

752
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,110
- Come on.
- Tommy.

753
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,107
- [Frank] I'm Frank.

754
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:23,190
- Nice to meet you Frank.

755
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:27,335
- Do you guys live around here?

756
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,409
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

757
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:30,659
- We live here.

758
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,570
- [Frank] Oh, you live in the park.

759
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,644
- [Tommy] Yeah, we're homeless.

760
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:34,644
- Oh.
- Yeah.

761
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,662
- [Frank] Well like
the world is your home.

762
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,856
- It's everyone's home.
- That's true.

763
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:40,343
- Some people have homes as well.

764
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:43,274
- Yeah, we have an apartment.

765
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:44,864
- Yeah, it's cool, man.

766
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:47,194
- Why is it that all
your friends are bums?

767
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:49,292
- Hey, we're not bums!
- No, Tommy, no.

768
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:52,097
- We're not bums!
- Tommy, Tommy, no!

769
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:53,007
Safe place.

770
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:54,735
Dude, I'm sorry for that.

771
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:55,567
- I'm sorry.

772
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:56,401
- No, don't look at him yet.

773
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:58,212
- Oh.
- It's fine.

774
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,282
You know, just be a little careful, okay.

775
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:00,115
He's a diabetic.

776
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:01,280
He kind of gets worked up.
- Low blood sugar.

777
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,815
Low blood sugar.
- Low blood sugar, man.

778
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,901
- We'll get you some Krispy
Kreme later, we're good.

779
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:08,103
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

780
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:10,692
- It's cool, we're all buddies here.

781
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:11,543
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

782
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,059
- So, how'd this happen?

783
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,371
How'd you get homeless?

784
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,378
- You know, story's old as time.

785
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:20,057
You know, we were hanging
out with Sid Murphy,

786
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:24,224
starts smoking dog shit
like 24/6 minus Lord's day.

787
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,544
- Is that dog shit really that good?

788
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,471
- Dude, it is fucking God.

789
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:32,846
- Dude, it takes you on
a fucking roller coaster.

790
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:35,017
Like one day you just
graduate high school,

791
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:37,413
the next moment you're
fucking smoking dog shit

792
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:39,825
in the gazebo next to
hipsters fucking each other.

793
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,734
- Yeah, but man get off that true.

794
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:44,163
- It's true.

795
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,094
It's true.
- It's good.

796
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,815
- We've been sober, dog shit's over.

797
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,364
- [Tommy] About like.

798
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:49,197
- [Jimmy] What was it, three months?

799
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,029
- [Tommy] Four.

800
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,571
- Four months.

801
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:52,821
- In dog years?

802
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:56,803
- Fuck you.

803
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,291
Dog years, this is my life
you're talking about, man.

804
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,875
And yes, dog years.

805
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:06,289
- He was correct.
- He was right, yeah.

806
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,615
- Well, how's Sid doing?

807
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:09,685
- I don't really know, man.

808
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:11,507
We haven't really seen him since

809
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:13,788
he took our shoes and ran off on us.

810
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:14,986
- Dude, we don't have shoes anymore.

811
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,344
- [Frank] Oh, you're not
wearing any shoes right now?

812
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,725
- No, we just painted our feet.

813
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:18,724
- Optical illusion.

814
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:20,207
- [Frank] Oh, good.

815
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,309
- [Alex] You got me, fooled me.

816
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,975
- Yeah, but we know.

817
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,035
So what are you guys
doing around here anyway?

818
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:29,824
You're doing the girls tour or something?

819
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,832
- [Alex] Just walking around.

820
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:31,920
- [Frank] Taking a
stroll through the park.

821
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,971
You know, taking in the sights.

822
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:36,603
- He got fired from his job so yeah.

823
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:39,097
- You know why I think I got
fired, it sounded like that.

824
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,889
I mean I've just been so fucking confused.

825
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,557
(Jimmy gagging)

826
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,097
- Really?

827
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:48,738
You're gonna complain about your life?

828
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:50,286
- Yeah, dude, we're fucking homeless.

829
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:51,172
- [Tommy] You all right, man?

830
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:52,550
- Yeah.

831
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,664
So like what do you guys
plan for the evenings?

832
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,556
- Nothing really, we're just walking.

833
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:59,722
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.

834
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:03,086
- Guys.

835
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:05,669
You guys wanna smoke some weed?

836
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,760
- Yeah, I guess so, as long
as there's no dog shit.

837
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,594
- Oh.

838
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:10,927
Oh, this mother.

839
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:14,799
- One, two, three.

840
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:20,869
- [Alex] Hold up.

841
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,052
Hold up guys.

842
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:32,508
- I'm exhausted.

843
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,758
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

844
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,054
Yeah?

845
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:53,573
- Torrie's at the door.

846
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:54,406
- [Frank] Really?

847
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:57,831
- Yeah, well she never
comes just to see me.

848
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:59,882
- Well can you tell her
to give me a minute?

849
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,462
- [Alex] Why don't you go tell her?

850
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:02,296
- I can't.

851
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:03,260
- [Alex] Why not?

852
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,332
- Alex, I have morning wood.

853
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,250
- Oh, okay.

854
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:14,182
Give Frank a fucking
minute, he has morning wood.

855
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,270
- [Frank] What the fuck?

856
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:20,019
- Fuck you too bitch.

857
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:22,771
- [Frank] Hey.

858
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:24,283
Oh, yeah, sorry about Alex.

859
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:25,117
- Yup.

860
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:25,950
- [Frank] You wanna come in?

861
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,783
- Yeah.

862
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:29,365
- So welcome to my humble home.

863
00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:31,470
Well how's everything been?

864
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,913
I don't get a call, no text.

865
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,078
What's up?

866
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,301
- [Torrie] I've just
been really busy lately.

867
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,370
- Yeah, doing what?

868
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:41,201
- Uh, I got a job at MTV.

869
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:42,784
- Wow, look at you.

870
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,621
Have you met Carson Daly yet?

871
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:49,174
- Carson Daly is not on MTV anymore.

872
00:30:49,173 --> 00:30:51,704
- Oh, fuck it, I don't watch TV,

873
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:54,752
but I guess I'll try to tune
in more now since you're on it.

874
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,051
- Yeah, thanks.

875
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:59,468
I hear you're back to handing out flyers.

876
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,134
- Yeah, that is a thing.

877
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:05,175
I'm not really sure
about it anymore though.

878
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,497
I think I got fired.

879
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,569
- [Torrie] Why?

880
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,847
- I wasn't handing them out.

881
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,544
- Well, that'll do it.

882
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:11,506
- [Frank] I guess.

883
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:14,813
- How long have you been living with Alex?

884
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:15,961
- [Frank] It's been about like two months.

885
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,373
Not very long.

886
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:19,173
- Do you like it?

887
00:31:19,173 --> 00:31:20,942
- Yeah, it's fun.

888
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:23,112
He's a bit of a weird guy though.

889
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:25,601
Like the other morning, I
walk into the living room

890
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,089
and he's just stuffing toilet
paper rolls in his mouth.

891
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,152
He tells me that some girl told him

892
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:32,370
that's how it feels to give a blowjob.

893
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:34,180
- Yeah, girls do that all
the time in high school.

894
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,481
You didn't know that?

895
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:37,315
- [Frank] Really?

896
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:39,732
- No, not really, that's fucking stupid.

897
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:40,951
- So you're telling me you've never

898
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:42,112
put a toilet paper roll in your mouth?

899
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:44,200
- I've never even thought about it.

900
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,033
- Yeah.

901
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,437
- Alex is weird.

902
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,888
- I love him though.

903
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:51,356
- Speaking of guys you love, how's Dave?

904
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,876
- Well, he's back.

905
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,148
- [Torrie] For good?

906
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:56,647
- I guess, he's all graduated and stuff.

907
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,457
- Great, have you seen him?

908
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,989
- Yeah, we've hung out.

909
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:01,668
I'm actually gonna go
out tonight with him.

910
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,298
Have a bit of a night out of town.

911
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,696
- Boys only?

912
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:07,425
- [Frank] Not necessarily, why?

913
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,306
- I was gonna invite you out tonight.

914
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,139
- [Frank] Where?

915
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,365
- Just to some party.

916
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,285
You guys should come,

917
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:15,360
you should bring Dave, and invite Alex.

918
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,679
- Um, I don't know, I'll
see, 'cause I gotta ask Dave

919
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,509
if that's what he wants to do.

920
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:20,857
- Okay.

921
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:21,691
It's been a while.

922
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:22,970
You should really come.

923
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,721
We can catch up and stuff.

924
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:26,192
- Aren't we catching up right now?

925
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:27,072
- Kind of.

926
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,551
I have to go to work.

927
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:29,569
- [Frank] Oh.

928
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:30,879
- But text me and let me know.

929
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,561
- Uh, sure, will do.

930
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,394
- [Torrie] See ya.

931
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:34,644
- I'll be here.

932
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,867
(phone ringing)

933
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:53,721
Hey, what's up man?

934
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,713
Uh, oh you got time now.

935
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,153
Um, yeah I'll come down.

936
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,692
You wanna hang around the park and drink

937
00:32:58,692 --> 00:33:00,786
for a bit before we go to the party?

938
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,525
- Sure, sounds good.

939
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:03,563
- Cool.

940
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:07,173
Yeah, I'll see you in a bit, see ya.

941
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:09,839
Hey, um, Alex, you wanna come meet Dave?

942
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,318
We're gonna go drink
before we go to the party.

943
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:15,305
- Nah, just go, just head out.

944
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:17,104
- [Frank] Why, are you
gonna meet us there?

945
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:19,286
- Yeah, later, later on.

946
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:21,273
- Well then why don't you just come now?

947
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:22,844
- 'Cause I gotta brush my teeth.

948
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,728
I got a whole bunch of things to do.

949
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:26,799
- By brush your teeth, do you mean

950
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,492
you're gonna jerk off
now that I'm not here?

951
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:31,528
- Yeah, mostly likely, yeah.

952
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:33,643
- [Frank] All right,
well have fun, okay, go.

953
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:34,634
- Oh, thanks.

954
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:36,050
- [Frank] See ya.

955
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,647
- So, do you take all your dates here?

956
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:53,280
- Now that I'm thinking about
it, it's kind of creepy.

957
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,480
- And it's probably why
Hailey broke up with you.

958
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,397
- Could be.

959
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,364
- Can you not start that?

960
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:03,490
Why are you smiling?

961
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,681
- Hey, I'm just appreciating the moment.

962
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:08,840
It's not every day I get to see you.

963
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,581
- Well I'm here now.

964
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,520
- Yeah, you are.

965
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:13,561
- So tell me.

966
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:17,461
What's been really going
on in the life of Frank?

967
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:18,954
- Well you know pretty much all of it.

968
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:23,221
I got dumped by Hailey and
I got fired from my job.

969
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:24,678
- [Dave] Where did you work?

970
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:26,461
- I actually had a pretty sweet gig.

971
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,648
I was working at Galaxy Comics.

972
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:29,578
- [Dave] Really?

973
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:30,950
- Yeah, it was fucking awesome.

974
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,739
I just got to sit around
and read comics all day.

975
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,750
- Well, why'd you get fired?

976
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,137
- I didn't really get fired per se.

977
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:42,089
I just kind of went into my job
and my manager wasn't there.

978
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:45,496
Instead there was just this
really tall big Russian dude.

979
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:47,425
And when I asked him,
"Hey, where's my manager?",

980
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:50,563
he said, "He moved to Las Vegas."

981
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:52,094
- Sounds kind of fishy.

982
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:55,374
- Yeah, no one's ever,
no one's seen him since.

983
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:57,770
- He's probably dead.

984
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:01,742
- He did have a really
big gambling problem.

985
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:03,075
- So, what else?

986
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:06,385
- Nothing much.

987
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:09,949
I just kinda drink a lot
and watch Wahlburgers.

988
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,121
- Wahlburgers?

989
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,344
- [Frank] You don't know
what Wahlburgers is?

990
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,177
- No.

991
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:15,010
- It's awesome.

992
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,195
It's this reality show
about a burger restaurant

993
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:20,434
owned and managed by the Wahlbergs.

994
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:23,075
So it's Mark, Donnie, and
the whole Wahlberg clan,

995
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:25,304
just selling burgers in Boston.

996
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:27,336
- Who would have guessed
that the underwear model

997
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,836
would be in a show called Wahlburgers now?

998
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:35,550
- So, how was, how was
your four years at college?

999
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,894
You hardly ever came
down and visit anyone.

1000
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:41,099
- Yeah, I mean, I was really busy.

1001
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,585
- Well, when was your graduation?

1002
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,407
- [Dave] In May, but it was small

1003
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,725
and just my family came up.

1004
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:49,235
- I would have came.

1005
00:35:49,235 --> 00:35:51,105
- Well thanks, but you didn't have to.

1006
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:54,916
Like I said, it was just
my family pretty much so.

1007
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:55,749
- Yeah.

1008
00:35:58,204 --> 00:36:01,371
- So, let's talk about something else.

1009
00:36:03,356 --> 00:36:04,794
How about the Broncos?

1010
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,003
- I don't even know what that means.

1011
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:08,775
Is that like a gay thing?

1012
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:09,608
- Kind of.

1013
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,944
(Frank farts)

1014
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,064
Is that what we're doing?

1015
00:36:16,063 --> 00:36:17,322
Fart noises?

1016
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:21,275
- Hey, was that not clever and/or quirky?

1017
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:23,643
- Yes, that's what I
love about you the most.

1018
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:25,454
Your quirkiness.

1019
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:27,563
- Hey, it's hard to
keep up this character.

1020
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:31,032
Man, it's not easy being
so cynical and cute.

1021
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:33,752
- [Dave] Yeah, but you're
neither of those things.

1022
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:35,092
I guess you can be a little bit cynical,

1023
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,420
but you don't have to be a
cynical asshole all the time.

1024
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,670
- But I do have to be cute.

1025
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,659
- I thought I was the gay one here.

1026
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,525
- Hey, well I don't, you know,
like take dicks up my butt,

1027
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:48,931
so I think you still have
the cake on that one.

1028
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:53,373
- Well, I've never actually
had a dick there, dick.

1029
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:56,108
- Really, you've never had
like a dick in the thing?

1030
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:56,941
Nothing?

1031
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,773
- [Dave] No.

1032
00:36:57,773 --> 00:37:01,199
- Strange, so like what
do you do like sex-wise?

1033
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,262
- I don't know, mouth stuff.

1034
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:05,630
- Interesting.

1035
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,331
What is it, like no one's ever offered?

1036
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:09,280
Or is it just something
you don't wanna do?

1037
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,114
- No, I get a lot of
offers, but I don't know.

1038
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,500
I might let the guy I'm seeing now do it.

1039
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,291
- You like him that much?

1040
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,833
- I guess.

1041
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,880
- Hey, well if anybody's gonna
be taking your virginity,

1042
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,440
I gotta meet them first, Dave.

1043
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,182
I gotta approve.

1044
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:27,324
- [Dave] Hey, you don't
have to police my asshole.

1045
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:28,652
- Oh, I guess not anymore since

1046
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:31,402
you got a college degree and all.

1047
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:36,134
- So, we gonna talk about
my asshole all night

1048
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:38,272
or we're gonna go to the party?

1049
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:40,188
- I guess we should go.

1050
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:53,701
- Hey, is there something
you wanna talk about?

1051
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:55,181
I mean, I don't know, but it seems

1052
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:57,615
like there's something on your mind.

1053
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,661
- So we're gonna do this now?

1054
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,494
- What?

1055
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:01,327
I wanna talk.

1056
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,386
You seem like you wanna talk.

1057
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:03,657
- It's nothing important.

1058
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:07,740
- Frank, stop being a
little bitch, just tell me.

1059
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:11,478
- It's just you never visited me, is all.

1060
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:14,104
Even when you were fucking
down here, I never saw you.

1061
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:16,282
That's what I'm thinking about.

1062
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:17,755
- Really, that's the issue?

1063
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,977
- Yeah, that's the issue.

1064
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:21,831
- I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

1065
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:23,221
I have other friends.

1066
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,661
I'm sorry I didn't center
my visits around you.

1067
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:27,058
- Don't be a fucking dick.

1068
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,901
A call, a text, would have sufficed.

1069
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,951
It's like you went up to college

1070
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,072
and got all fancy and dropped me.

1071
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:33,749
- Well I'm here now,
so what's the big deal?

1072
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,646
- So you were trying to drop me?

1073
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,054
- No one was trying to drop you, Frank.

1074
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:38,924
What are you talking about?

1075
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,914
I went to college and I
wanted to make new friends.

1076
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,535
I wanted to grow up.

1077
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:45,855
Sorry if you took it as a personal attack.

1078
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:47,724
- Fuck you man.

1079
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,993
It's just not the same anymore.

1080
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,193
- No, no, it's not, I know that.

1081
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:53,081
You're the one who seems to be

1082
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,932
having trouble realizing that.

1083
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:55,893
- Fuck you.

1084
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:58,414
- Oh, that's right, that's how
you solve all your problems.

1085
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:00,342
Fuck you, this is bullshit.

1086
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:02,483
Stop being a baby.

1087
00:39:02,483 --> 00:39:04,732
I mean, yeah, we're not
best friends anymore,

1088
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,571
but that's not bad.

1089
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:10,527
I mean, you have your
people and I have mine.

1090
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:12,841
- Can we just go to this
fucking party already?

1091
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,519
- Frank, I'm not trying to fight.

1092
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,768
- [Frank] Yeah.

1093
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:26,114
(electronic dance music)

1094
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,532
- Yeah so I was at Subway's.

1095
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:38,509
I tried to get a meatball marinara.

1096
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,753
No more meatballs.

1097
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,066
- [Torrie] How does that even happen?

1098
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:41,898
- That's what I was thinking.

1099
00:39:41,898 --> 00:39:43,438
- [Torrie] Shouldn't they just
have meatballs all the time?

1100
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:44,737
- No, they just put the sauce on the bread

1101
00:39:44,737 --> 00:39:45,798
and they just gave it to me like that.

1102
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:46,630
- Dave.

1103
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,463
- Hey, it's been forever.

1104
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:48,648
- Yeah.

1105
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:51,020
- Hey, I'm Dave, nice to finally meet you.

1106
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,028
- What's wrong?

1107
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:54,027
You guys look like shit.

1108
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,195
- [Torrie] How was your date?

1109
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,028
- Fine.

1110
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,608
- It was great, he's having a fit.

1111
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,191
- Frank, come here.

1112
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:03,904
Wanna try?

1113
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:04,979
- What's that?

1114
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:05,811
- Drugs.

1115
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,097
- [Frank] But like what does it do?

1116
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:12,014
- It makes you feel like a rainbow.

1117
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:16,686
- Oh what the hell.

1118
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:19,603
- Well, do we get some?

1119
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:22,219
- [Torrie] Everybody gets one.

1120
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,719
- I've never done this before.

1121
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,928
- Well there's a first
time for everything.

1122
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:31,789
- Yeah, well like how long
does it take to kick in?

1123
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:34,509
- Usually about 45 minutes.

1124
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:36,579
- So what happens now?

1125
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,280
- Well you can go dance.

1126
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,019
- Nah, I don't dance.

1127
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:42,814
- Believe me, after
tonight you're gonna dance.

1128
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,487
- I already regret this decision.

1129
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,338
- Well, you've already done it.

1130
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:47,838
So let's go dance.

1131
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,248
- So did you know that
Torrie was gonna drug us?

1132
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:54,338
- Nope, I had no idea.

1133
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:55,847
- Classic Torrie.

1134
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:56,681
- I guess.

1135
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:58,599
It's the first I'm hearing of any of it.

1136
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,980
- I mean it's not a bad thing.

1137
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:01,832
It looks like she's having fun.

1138
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,071
- I don't know man.

1139
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:06,192
It's just like everybody's
doing their own shit,

1140
00:41:06,192 --> 00:41:09,748
and here I am, spending
my days giving out flyers,

1141
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:11,791
smoking and drinking Four Lokos.

1142
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,860
- Gotta stop being so hard on yourself.

1143
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,947
You're 22.

1144
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:16,989
You have plenty of time to grow up.

1145
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:18,360
- No.

1146
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,202
I guess I just want to grow up.

1147
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,780
- I miss the old you.

1148
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,041
I come back and you're
crying over some girl.

1149
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,331
- Some girl.

1150
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:29,408
- Yeah, I mean okay, we were
best friends a long time ago,

1151
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:32,391
but I mean she broke your heart, fuck her.

1152
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,490
She's just some girl.

1153
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,324
- Just some girl.

1154
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:36,624
- Just some dumb girl.

1155
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:38,054
- You know what the thing is?

1156
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:39,435
- What?

1157
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:41,972
- I haven't had sex since her.

1158
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:43,083
- What?

1159
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:43,995
- Nope.

1160
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:45,184
Could have fingered some
girl the other night,

1161
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:48,244
but some guy beat me to it.

1162
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,956
- That's weird.

1163
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:51,894
- That's my life, Dave.

1164
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:54,204
- So, nothing physical since her?

1165
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:56,305
- Nope, not even a kiss.

1166
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:57,664
- Ah.

1167
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:59,683
- Yeah, and you know what I'm afraid of,

1168
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,123
is that when I do eventually get a girl,

1169
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:04,112
I'm just gonna end up crying

1170
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:06,545
and fucking moping all over her.

1171
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:08,601
- You're not gonna cry.

1172
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:10,027
- I don't know man, I
can't have that shit.

1173
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,489
What if she gives me
some bad review on Lulu?

1174
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,380
- Lulu?

1175
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,007
- Yeah, it's this app
where like girls rate guys.

1176
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:19,201
- Did someone give you a bad review?

1177
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:20,035
- Yeah, Hailey.

1178
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:22,649
She said I make too much noise during sex.

1179
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,510
- Do you?

1180
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,490
- No, I make like regular noise.

1181
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,710
- Like what?

1182
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,292
- Like (moans).

1183
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:30,941
- Do you make that face?

1184
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,030
- I don't know man.

1185
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,278
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1186
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:36,548
- I guess.

1187
00:42:36,548 --> 00:42:38,070
You wanna get out for a bit?

1188
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,153
- Yeah, sure.

1191

- Fuck, getting out felt really weird.

1192

00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:06,014
- Well, hate's a strong word.

1235
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:09,016
- Okay, then I really, really dislike him.

1236
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:09,849
- As do I.

1237
00:46:12,797 --> 00:46:15,328
- [Melissa] So, what are you doing here?

1238
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:16,197
Were you inside the party?

1239
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:17,332
- Yeah.

1240
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:19,248
- Oh, I didn't see you.

1241
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,101
Do you come to these parties often?

1242
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:23,619
- No, this is my first one actually.

1243
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:24,452
You?

1244
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:25,369
- I dabble.

1245
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,213
- I was actually here with
Dave, from high school.

1246
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:31,046
- Dave.

1247
00:46:31,045 --> 00:46:33,342
Dave was the one who shat
in the urinal, right?

1248
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:35,161
- Nobody took a shit in the urinal.

1249
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:37,454
- Look, I distinctly remember fecal matter

1250
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:41,663
being a big part of my
high school experience.

1251
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,262
That and my cousin fucking
everyone in the entire school.

1252
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:45,730
- [Frank] Well who could forget that?

1253
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:46,563
- Yeah.

1254
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:51,090
Look, I'm sorry about that girl.

1255
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,257
Hailey, right?

1256
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,038
Well, fuck her.

1257
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:57,282
She can't be that smart anyways.

1258
00:46:57,282 --> 00:46:58,400
- Why, 'cause she left me?

1259
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,434
- No, 'cause she's dating my cousin.

1260
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,182
- Well, he does have that sweet car.

1261
00:47:04,182 --> 00:47:06,420
- Yeah, it's a pretty sweet car.

1262
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,561
- [Frank] Well, what have you
been up to since high school?

1263
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:13,478
- School, partying, stuff, I guess.

1264
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:17,598
I'm studying economics.

1265
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,182
- Oh, so you're a beauty
with a brain, huh.

1266
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,447
- Are you trying to flirt with me?

1267
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:25,596
- [Frank] Yeah, kind of.

1268
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:29,467
- Oh, so you're flirting
with the enemy, huh.

1269
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:30,300
- Enemy?

1270
00:47:31,396 --> 00:47:32,396
- I'm sorry.

1271
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:34,715
I guess I just thought you'd have

1272
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:36,514
some sort of like gypsy curse over me

1273
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:38,576
and my family or something.

1274
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:41,316
- No, believe me, there's no
curse coming from this way.

1275
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:42,148
- Shit.

1276
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:45,316
Since when did you get so forgiving?

1277
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:47,113
- God, I have no fucking clue.

1278
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,847
- Well it's good to hear.

1279
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:50,559
I hate people that sit around moping

1280
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,028
about relationships months
after they've ended.

1281
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,155
- Yeah, those people are crazy, right?

1282
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:55,989
- Yeah.

1283
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:03,564
Well, I'ma head home, Frank.

1284
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,268
I have a nice Puerto Rican
fellow waiting for me.

1285
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:10,101
- Whoa.

1286
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:13,224
- Whoa, whoa, I am a free bitch, Frank.

1287
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,724
I am a free bitch.

1288
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:20,057
- [Frank] Um, maybe text me sometime.

1289
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:23,435
- Uh, I don't have your number.

1290
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:25,697
Maybe I'll see you at the next party.

1291
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:27,028
- Maybe.

1292
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:27,860
- Maybe.

1293
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:31,065
That's good to hear.

1294
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,355
See ya later, Frank.

1295
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:35,773
- [Frank] See ya.

1296
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:41,315
(electronic dance music)

1297
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:47,005
- You okay?

1298
00:48:47,005 --> 00:48:48,539
Do you need any water?

1299
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:49,666
- No, I think I'm okay.

1300
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:50,500
- Sure.

1301
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,833
How do you feel?

1302
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,360
- Kind of like the Grinch.

1303
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,470
- What does that mean?

1304
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:00,122
- You know in How the
Grinch Stole Christmas,

1305
00:49:00,123 --> 00:49:01,141
he gets the Christmas spirit,

1306
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:03,389
so it zooms in on his tiny little heart

1307
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:05,643
and then it grows three times its size,

1308
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:08,141
that's how I feel right now.

1309
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:09,391
- Oh, I'm glad.

1310
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:13,664
- So what happens now?

1311
00:49:13,664 --> 00:49:15,824
- You just enjoy the comedown.

1312
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,130
Eat some beef jerky.

1313
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,127
- Why?

1314
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:20,379
- I just think you'd really
enjoy some beef jerky.

1315
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:22,050
- Sure, I guess.

1316
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,831
- I'm gonna go dance for
a bit, you should join.

1317
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,879
- Nah, I think I'm gonna relax here.

1318
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,713
- Okay.

1319
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,403
- Torrie.

1320
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:37,795
(electronic dance music)

1321
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:43,829
- Crazy.

1322
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:44,662
Right?

1323
00:49:44,661 --> 00:49:45,734
- Holy moly.

1324
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:46,568
- Shit.

1325
00:49:47,494 --> 00:49:50,077
I actually saw Melissa outside.

1326
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:52,886
- Danny's cousin, Melissa?

1327
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:53,916
- Yeah, the hot one.

1328
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,388
- How's she doing?

1329
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:57,447
- She looks good.

1330
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:58,619
- What do you mean by good?

1331
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,119
- I don't know man, like good.

1332
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,489
- Looks like Alex is having a good time.

1333
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:08,905
(electronic dance music)

1334
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,291
- That's weird.

1335
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,791
You know the time?

1336
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,628
- What, it's 3:30?

1337
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:38,639
- Fuck, time went super fast.

1338
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,768
- So what, do you wanna
like get out of here?

1339
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:41,929
- Kind of, I was thinking of getting

1340
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:43,369
a drink before we head home.

1341
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:46,119
- All right, sure, we'll do that.

1342
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:52,063
- Are you sure you guys
are gonna head out?

1343
00:50:52,063 --> 00:50:53,516
- [Frank] Yeah, it's a bit late.

1344
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:54,820
- You had fun though.

1345
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,522
- Yeah, oh my god, so much fun.

1346
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,164
- And Alex looks like he had
a really good time tonight.

1347
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:01,746
- Oh, bro, I don't even know
what's going on right now.

1348
00:51:01,746 --> 00:51:03,329
- I don't know why we
haven't been hanging out

1349
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,177
until lately, but I really miss you guys

1350
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:07,039
and we should definitely
start hanging out more.

1351
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,539
- [Frank] Yeah, let's do that.

1352
00:51:12,422 --> 00:51:13,339
Drive safe.

1353
00:51:24,556 --> 00:51:26,284
- So you still want that drink?

1354
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,117
- Oh god no.

1355
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,615
Alcohol does not seem like
a good idea right now.

1356
00:51:29,614 --> 00:51:31,197
- Yeah, I hear you.

1357
00:51:32,983 --> 00:51:36,633
- You know, man, like I
feel kind of different.

1358
00:51:36,632 --> 00:51:37,465
- How?

1359
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:41,702
- I just spent so much time,
in the past seven months,

1360
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:44,371
I've been so angry with Hailey.

1361
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:47,614
I don't know, I feel like kind of lighter.

1362
00:51:47,614 --> 00:51:49,227
Happier maybe.

1363
00:51:49,228 --> 00:51:50,409
- That's good.

1364
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,980
You should take that
into your everyday life.

1365
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
- I guess I'm gonna try.

1366
00:51:57,246 --> 00:52:00,431
Fuck, I forgot I don't have a job.

1367
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:01,788
- Go get it back.

1368
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,398
- I guess that is what I'm
gonna have to do tomorrow.

1369
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:06,427
I'm gonna go in the
morning and to Escalon,

1370
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:08,911
beg and plead for my job back.

1371
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:11,028
Man, I gotta do something
with my life, dude.

1372
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:12,686
- Do you have any hidden talents?

1373
00:52:12,686 --> 00:52:15,480
- Nah, I'm pretty average.

1374
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:18,879
- Well, I'm sure you'll find something.

1375
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:19,878
- Hopefully.

1376
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:23,985
Holy shit.

1377
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,355
- What?

1378
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:27,802
- It's Sid Murphy.

1379
00:52:27,802 --> 00:52:29,207
- Sid Murphy?

1380
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:31,429
- [Frank] Sid Murphy is
an old friend of Alex.

1381
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:32,711
They used to go to school together.

1382
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,011
Guy has been living on the streets.

1383
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:37,219
- Are you gonna say hi to him?

1384
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:41,202
- I'm gonna go do something old
Frank would have never done.

1385
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:42,035
- Sure.

1386
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:52,201
- Hey, what is that you're
smoking in that pipe?

1387
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,782
- Dog shit.

1388
00:52:53,782 --> 00:52:55,161
- You're Sid Murphy, aren't you?

1389
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,193
- Yeah.

1390
00:52:56,193 --> 00:52:57,041
Who are you?

1391
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,240
- I'm Frank, I'm actually
friends with Alex.

1392
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,110
You guys went to high school together.

1393
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,320
- Yeah, yeah, I haven't
seen that guy in ages.

1394
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,269
- Yeah, well, he misses you man,

1395
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:10,248
and we actually ran into
Tommy and Jimmy the other day.

1396
00:53:10,248 --> 00:53:13,188
They said you stole their shoes.

1397
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:14,271
- Yeah, yeah.

1398
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:18,228
- Like what happened, Sid?

1399
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,130
I'm sure Alex would wanna know.

1400
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,127
Like after high school
you just ended up here?

1401
00:53:23,128 --> 00:53:26,573
- By the way, welcome to my home.

1402
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,983
I don't know man, I was just.

1403
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:30,163
I was just smoking dog shit.

1404
00:53:30,163 --> 00:53:31,960
My parents couldn't get down with it.

1405
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,333
They kicked me out.

1406
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:37,411
- So you were smoking dog
shit before you were homeless?

1407
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:41,264
- Yeah, I just I like
to get down, you know.

1408
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:42,997
What, are you judging me?

1409
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:45,728
- Kind of, it's like there's other drugs.

1410
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:48,423
Dog shit isn't even a drug.

1411
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:49,900
- You know it's like they say,

1412
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,132
don't knock until you try it.

1413
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:55,818
Don't not smoke it until you smoked it.

1414
00:53:55,818 --> 00:53:59,061
- [Frank] Well I'm not gonna smoke that.

1415
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,851
- Dog shit's not just for
picking up and throwing away.

1416
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:03,282
They're perfectly good resource.

1417
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,213
It's like not using solar power.

1418
00:54:05,213 --> 00:54:08,352
We're just throwing that resource away.

1419
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:11,181
If I could smoke solar energy, I would.

1420
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,389
But I can't so I smoke dog shit.

1421
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:17,592
Ha, they're like getting
that sweet steaming nug

1422
00:54:17,592 --> 00:54:19,860
from that dog's bum-bum.

1423
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,462
God, you're just like hitting that pipe.

1424
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,246
There's just nothing better.

1425
00:54:25,246 --> 00:54:27,335
- So you were just walking
down the street one day,

1426
00:54:27,335 --> 00:54:29,519
saw some dog shit, thought to yourself,

1427
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:31,713
hey, I wonder if that gets you high.

1428
00:54:31,713 --> 00:54:33,063
- No, I just knew it would.

1429
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:36,116
I don't know, there was like a,

1430
00:54:36,117 --> 00:54:37,123
they say it's like a sixth sense

1431
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:39,633
but I call it my second sense.

1432
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:40,945
It's number two.

1433
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:44,099
And I just saw it and I was
like I gotta light that up.

1434
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:45,478
I gotta put it in my lungs.

1435
00:54:45,478 --> 00:54:47,043
I'm gonna get it straight to my brain.

1436
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:48,413
- [Frank] And it was
all downhill from there?

1437
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:51,313
- I mean uphill, like
I've been living high.

1438
00:54:51,313 --> 00:54:52,532
- Well I wanna help you out, Sid.

1439
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:54,182
I wanna see you in a better situation.

1440
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:56,056
Can I give you some money?

1441
00:54:56,056 --> 00:54:57,509
- You don't have to do that.

1442
00:54:57,509 --> 00:54:58,342
- [Frank] I want to.

1443
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:00,481
- Okay.
- Here's.

1444
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:01,963
- [Sid] Hey, thanks man.

1445
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:04,414
- Well you know what,
just take that money.

1446
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,443
When you get up in the morning, go out,

1447
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:09,672
buy some jeans, get a nice shirt.

1448
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:11,202
You know, go out there
and try to get a job.

1449
00:55:11,202 --> 00:55:15,467
I'm pretty sure there has to
be something you could do.

1450
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:19,550
- Now by jeans, did you
mean alcohol and ecstasy?

1451
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:23,014
- No, no, I did not.

1452
00:55:23,014 --> 00:55:25,014
I meant shirt and jeans.

1453
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:28,320
- Shrooms and whiskey.

1454
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,543
- [Frank] Nope.

1455
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:34,775
I hate your anatomy standing there.

1456
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:36,884
- There's dog shit everywhere in my brain.

1457
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:39,805
It sounds like you want
me to go out and buy it.

1458
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,637
Malt liquor and crank.

1459
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,234
- Ah, well you shouldn't.

1460
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:50,690
I hope you don't, 'cause
I just gave you that money

1461
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,849
and I can't ask for it back now.

1462
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,440
- We'll see.

1463
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,840
- [Frank] I hope you do the right thing.

1464
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,690
- I hope the right thing
makes me feel great.

1465
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,829
- I have faith.

1466
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,709
You, you know, you're going places, Sid.

1467
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,687
And I hope to see you again.

1468
00:56:07,688 --> 00:56:10,930
- I'll be right here or
getting high somewhere.

1469
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:12,239
- [Frank] Well, I'll see you around.

1470
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,239
- All right.

1471
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,091
- That was a nice thing you did for him.

1472
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:27,282
- Well I did it for Alex, you
know, they grew up together.

1473
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:28,533
- But either way, I'm starting

1474
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:30,442
to like the new Frank already.

1475
00:56:30,442 --> 00:56:34,608
- Yeah, I don't know what
the fuck is going on with me.

1476
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:39,783
- So I gotta get on the F train.

1477
00:56:39,784 --> 00:56:41,333
- I know.

1478
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,442
- But I had fun tonight and it looks like

1479
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,173
you got more than just your balls back.

1480
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:47,780
- Oh, I definitely did.

1481
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,818
- Frank, listen, you know
you can talk to me, right?

1482
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:52,032
I mean, I'm here.

1483
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:56,032
I might not always be
here, but you can text me.

1484
00:56:57,032 --> 00:56:59,000
- Yeah, I'll do that.

1485
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,050
- All right.

1486
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,650
Um, I'll see you later.

1487
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,903
- Yeah.

1488
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:03,737
See you.

1489
00:57:03,737 --> 00:57:04,570
- See you.

1490
00:57:06,331 --> 00:57:10,498
("Grand Navy Plaza" by Silent Partner)

1491
00:57:47,824 --> 00:57:49,869
- Well, good morning.

1492
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,954
- Alright, what are you up to?

1493
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:53,876
- I'm gonna go try and get my job back.

1494
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:55,356
- [Alex] Cool, cool.

1495
00:57:55,356 --> 00:57:57,067
- What are you up to?

1496
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:58,856
- I don't know, I'm
watching Face the Death,

1497
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:00,538
on Blu-ray right now.

1498
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:04,711
I heard very good things about
it, so I checked that out.

1499
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:06,331
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

1500
00:58:06,331 --> 00:58:07,413
I'll see you later.

1501
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:08,755
- [Alex] All right, good luck.

1502
00:58:08,755 --> 00:58:10,172
- [Frank] Thanks.

1503
00:58:11,695 --> 00:58:14,394
- It's just one left,
please, just one left.

1504
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:17,914
Fuck, he killed them, you fucking.

1505
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:18,748
Wait.

1506
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,406
Josh?

1507
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:23,666
Josh, you fucking asshole.

1508
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,525
I've been peeling lemons
for like two weeks, dude.

1509
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:28,065
I thought you were gonna kill my family.

1510
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:31,355
Oh, you fucking asshole, you owe me.

1511
00:58:31,355 --> 00:58:33,333
Fuck dude, that was fucking,

1512
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,675
that's a good prank, I'll give him that.

1513
00:58:35,675 --> 00:58:37,355
I'll give him that.

1514
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:38,189
Fuck.

1515
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,099
Yo.

1516
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:41,932
- Hey.

1517
00:58:41,931 --> 00:58:44,848
- Lemons don't mean shit to me now.

1518
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:45,859
- Oh, that's good.

1519
00:58:45,858 --> 00:58:46,692
- Mm-hmm.

1520
00:58:48,021 --> 00:58:49,036
How you doing man?

1521
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:50,586
What you doing here?

1522
00:58:50,586 --> 00:58:52,126
- I was wondering if we could like talk

1523
00:58:52,126 --> 00:58:55,648
about me getting the job back,
to be working here again.

1524
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:57,718
I know I fucked up before

1525
00:58:57,717 --> 00:58:59,426
but I wanna have more responsibilities.

1526
00:58:59,427 --> 00:59:01,117
I could take a pay cut if necessary.

1527
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,000
I just need, I think this is

1528
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
the best place for me right now.

1529
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,833
- Frank.

1530
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,199
I kind of gave it to someone else man.

1531
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:11,217
- [Frank] Already?

1532
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:12,210
- Guy came in here.

1533
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,023
He's fucking pretty bummy.

1534
00:59:15,023 --> 00:59:16,824
He smelled like shit.

1535
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:18,744
And like, he just look
like he needed to work,

1536
00:59:18,744 --> 00:59:22,045
so like, you know, he helped
me peel some fucking lemons,

1537
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:24,666
and then I gave him
flyers to hand them out.

1538
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:26,384
He's doing a great job here man.

1539
00:59:26,384 --> 00:59:28,336
I can't get rid of him.

1540
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:29,396
- Nah.
- I'm sorry.

1541
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:33,139
- Yeah, I think, I think
I know what happened.

1542
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,774
- But um, you know what?

1543
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:36,817
I love you, man.

1544
00:59:36,817 --> 00:59:37,650
I respect you.

1545
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,017
You can do fucking way better than this.

1546
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:41,435
I believe in you.

1547
00:59:41,436 --> 00:59:43,865
Things are gonna fucking work out, man.

1548
00:59:43,864 --> 00:59:45,531
We're gonna fucking,

1549
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:48,806
we're gonna get it right on the spot.

1550
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:50,976
- Right on the spot.

1551
00:59:50,976 --> 00:59:54,136
Ah, well, yeah, don't
worry about it, it's okay.

1552
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,873
I'll try to find something.

1553
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:59,436
- [Escalon Boss] I believe you, man.

1554
00:59:59,436 --> 01:00:00,269
- All right.

1555
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:01,599
- You're a good guy.

1556
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,682
See you dude.

1557
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:08,155
Fucking shit.

1558
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:09,738
Fucking lemons man.

1559
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:32,494
- Hey.

1560
01:00:32,494 --> 01:00:33,612
- Oh, hey man, Frank, right?

1561
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:35,331
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1562
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,079
- So you did it, you got the job.

1563
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:39,400
- Yeah, yeah, there's this
phone shop down the street

1564
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,983
that pay me to pass out flyers.

1565
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,109
It's a good start, right?

1566
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,257
- Yes, it's definitely a good start.

1567
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:47,465
Um, I actually just had this job.

1568
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:48,673
- Yeah, no kidding.

1569
01:00:48,672 --> 01:00:50,207
Where are you now?

1570
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:51,400
- Jobless.

1571
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,233
- [Sid] Huh.

1572
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,447
- Don't have a job.

1573
01:00:53,447 --> 01:00:54,934
- You know I lost a job cumming

1574
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:57,419
in the fry seasoning at McDonald's.

1575
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:59,288
- [Frank] You lost it, you had it?

1576
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,260
- I had the job and they fired me

1577
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,637
because I just filled up the fry seasoning

1578
01:01:03,637 --> 01:01:05,197
with dried out cum.

1579
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:08,605
So it was like a salted granular.

1580
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:10,911
Anyways, hey, hey,

1581
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:13,108
I had some leftover money from earlier.

1582
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:14,853
- Oh, don't worry about it, keep it.

1583
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:16,211
Buy some more stuff with it.

1584
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,092
Buy some more jeans.

1585
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:19,780
A man can never have too many jeans.

1586
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,538
- Dad used to say that.

1587
01:01:21,538 --> 01:01:23,815
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, then he left us.

1588
01:01:23,815 --> 01:01:26,153
- [Frank] Did he at least leave you jeans?

1589
01:01:26,153 --> 01:01:28,188
- No, just with a legacy of trannies.

1590
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:31,250
Tranny block, that's what
we kids used to call it.

1591
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:33,084
Anyways, but yeah, he,

1592
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:36,813
he never bought me jeans
before, but you have.

1593
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:39,422
- So I bought you more
jeans than your dad.

1594
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:41,989
I'm like, I'm better
than your, I'm like dad.

1595
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,201
- You're like, you're like new dad.

1596
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,739
New dad, give me a hug.

1597
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:48,905
I've been looking for you.

1598
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:53,290
- [Frank] Well, yeah.

1599
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,458
Yeah, new dad.

1600
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:58,202
- Anyways, hey, do you have a dad?

1601
01:01:58,202 --> 01:01:59,496
- [Frank] Yeah.

1602
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:00,471
- [Sid] You should give him a flyer.

1603
01:02:00,472 --> 01:02:01,653
You should give him two flyers.

1604
01:02:01,653 --> 01:02:03,632
- Yeah, next time I see him.
- On me.

1605
01:02:03,632 --> 01:02:05,672
- [Frank] I'll give it to him on you.

1606
01:02:05,672 --> 01:02:06,992
- Yeah, like the old days.

1607
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:10,219
You know what, next time
you see Alex, say hi for me.

1608
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:11,118
- Yeah.

1609
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,442
- [Sid] And give him a flyer.

1610
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:14,050
- All right, I live with him,

1611
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,806
so we're just gonna have
these around the house.

1612
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:16,639
- That's great.

1613
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:21,349
You can give him probably
a couple other flyers.

1614
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,108
I'll give you one for the other side too.

1615
01:02:23,108 --> 01:02:24,619
Hey, we should hang out.

1616
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:26,720
You, and me, and Alex.

1617
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:27,767
Mix it up.

1618
01:02:27,768 --> 01:02:29,632
Pass out some flyers.

1619
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:30,517
- Do something.

1620
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:31,349
- [Sid] You guys can come over.

1621
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:33,094
We can empty out some condoms.

1622
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:33,943
- Don't wanna do that.

1623
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:34,777
- [Sid] Okay.

1624
01:02:34,777 --> 01:02:35,677
- Yeah.

1625
01:02:35,677 --> 01:02:37,462
- [Sid] Anyways, well I
need to get back to my job.

1626
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:40,046
- Yeah, I'm gonna go back home.

1627
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:42,572
- That's cute, rubbing it in.

1628
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,322
- [Frank] Well, yeah.

1629
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:46,878
I'm just gonna go home.

1630
01:02:46,878 --> 01:02:47,711
Not trying to rub it in.

1631
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:49,199
- Yeah, just gonna go, just gonna go

1632
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,340
masturbate into some couch cushions again.

1633
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,764
- Yeah, 'cause I can.

1634
01:02:53,764 --> 01:02:54,597
- Yeah?

1635
01:02:54,597 --> 01:02:55,430
- [Frank] Yeah.

1636
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:57,337
- Hey, when you're at home, sitting naked

1637
01:02:57,338 --> 01:03:01,480
on your couch in the
living room, masturbating,

1638
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,519
why don't you take some pictures

1639
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:04,127
and shoot a little video for me?

1640
01:03:04,128 --> 01:03:04,961
You can show me.

1641
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,960
- I'm not gonna do that.

1642
01:03:08,407 --> 01:03:09,639
No.

1643
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:13,458
- Yeah, but the next time we
hang out, you could show 'em.

1644
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:14,291
- [Frank] No, that's weird.

1645
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,588
Why would I do that?

1646
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:17,422
- [Sid] You're the best.

1647
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:18,554
- I'm not your new dad.

1648
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:19,945
I am the best though.

1649
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:20,778
I'll see you later.

1650
01:03:20,778 --> 01:03:21,914
- [Sid] Cool.

1651
01:03:21,914 --> 01:03:23,016
- Have fun with the new job.

1652
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:23,849
- I will.

1653
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:25,088
Have fun with the jerking off.

1654
01:03:25,088 --> 01:03:26,040
I'll be thinking about you.

1655
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:27,623
- [Frank] Ah, okay.

1656
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:39,329
- Morning.

1657
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,607
What's up?

1658
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:45,191
- Hey man, I wanted to come
over and talk a little bit.

1659
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,489
- About last night?

1660
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:49,906
I'm still kind of recovering.

1661
01:03:51,617 --> 01:03:52,695
- This is hard.

1662
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:55,259
I've never I don't really do this a lot.

1663
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,343
I wanted to apologize for last night.

1664
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,282
- It's okay, I mean.

1665
01:04:02,282 --> 01:04:03,532
- No, it's not.

1666
01:04:04,516 --> 01:04:07,291
That's the thing, that it's not okay.

1667
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:09,432
I've been such an asshole to you.

1668
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:11,974
It's just you went to college

1669
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:15,145
and I was just afraid of
like being my own person

1670
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:17,064
and I blamed you for
it and I wasn't right,

1671
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,937
and then the thing with Hailey happened.

1672
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:21,028
And I'm just I don't know, I've just been

1673
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:24,189
really upset past couple of years,

1674
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:26,927
and I took it out on you, I'm sorry.

1675
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:29,677
It was never your responsibility.

1676
01:04:30,936 --> 01:04:32,737
- It's okay.

1677
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:36,904
I mean, things are getting
better and they're looking up.

1678
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:38,701
- Yeah, maybe.

1679
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:41,851
I've just felt like a piece of shit, man.

1680
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:43,202
- Well, you might be a piece of shit,

1681
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:47,450
but you're my piece of
shit, and I love you.

1682
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:48,866
- I love you too.

1683
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:51,990
- How'd that job thing go?

1684
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,411
- Sid Murphy got it.

1685
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:55,661
- That's funny.

1686
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:59,350
You didn't need that place anyways.

1687
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:00,615
You'll be fine.

1688
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:01,449
- Thanks.

1689
01:05:02,456 --> 01:05:05,696
- I was gonna go on in and
watch the Wahlburgers marathon.

1690
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,505
Do you wanna come?

1691
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:11,501
- Nah, I think I'm gonna head
home, but some time soon.

1692
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:13,356
- All right, I'll see you later.

1693
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:14,606
- Yeah, see ya.

1694
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,628
- How'd the whole try to
get your job back work out?

1695
01:05:40,628 --> 01:05:41,514
- It didn't.

1696
01:05:41,514 --> 01:05:43,297
He already gave the job away.

1697
01:05:43,297 --> 01:05:44,130
- Really?

1698
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:44,963
- Yeah.

1699
01:05:44,963 --> 01:05:45,796
- Sorry man.

1700
01:05:45,795 --> 01:05:49,547
- But you'll never guess who got it.

1701
01:05:49,547 --> 01:05:50,776
- I don't know, who?

1702
01:05:50,777 --> 01:05:52,246
- Fucking Sid Murphy.

1703
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:53,079
- Really?

1704
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,663
Get the fuck out of here.

1705
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:56,373
That's, that's cool.

1706
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:59,123
- Yeah, it's pretty, pretty cool.

1707
01:06:00,016 --> 01:06:01,988
- But it still leaves you jobless.

1708
01:06:01,987 --> 01:06:03,308
- Yeah, pretty jobless.

1709
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:06,767
- Yeah, and do you have any
clue what you wanna do next?

1710
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:07,786
- Nah.

1711
01:06:07,786 --> 01:06:09,026
- No ideas?

1712
01:06:09,027 --> 01:06:10,659
- Nope.

1713
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:12,096
- Don't worry about it.

1714
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:13,143
- Yeah.
- You'll be fine.

1715
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:14,703
- Yeah, I should be okay.

1716
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,914
It's not like it's the end of the world.

1717
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:19,119
- Well, not that we know of.

1718
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:19,952
- Yeah.

1719
01:06:19,952 --> 01:06:20,786
- Yeah.

1720
01:06:21,893 --> 01:06:23,525
- Yeah.

1721
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,816
Uh, so what do you wanna do now?

1722
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:27,648
- I don't know.

1723
01:06:27,648 --> 01:06:28,911
Wanna go to the movies?

1724
01:06:28,911 --> 01:06:29,821
- Yeah we do.

1725
01:06:29,822 --> 01:06:31,905
- All right, so let's go.

1726
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,346
My treat with the jobless ass.

1727
01:06:38,347 --> 01:06:40,365
- [Frank] Thank you.

1728
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:43,949
("The Flames" by Meth Dad)

1729
01:06:58,635 --> 01:07:02,718
♫ Woke up to the flames and fire

1730
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:10,907
♫ A leap of faith to escape death

1731
01:07:10,907 --> 01:07:12,443
- We're just gonna do a documentary

1732
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:14,306
about how this film is falling apart.

1733
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:16,139
- [Woman] Shit, again.

1734
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:19,442
- I'll sue Flubber Boy.

1735
01:07:21,273 --> 01:07:24,940
When I first heard of the
idea, it sounded cool.

1736
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,476
Thought it'd be a little fun experiment

1737
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:30,643
with Roberto, here, Carlos,
couple of friends from school.

1738
01:07:32,418 --> 01:07:34,716
Days go by as filming,

1739
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,884
starts, you know, getting into action.

1740
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:40,836
I don't know, maybe I just realized

1741
01:07:40,836 --> 01:07:42,552
that Roberto has no talent.

1742
01:07:42,552 --> 01:07:46,385
♫ Of the untold nightmare too

1743
01:07:51,077 --> 01:07:55,244
♫ We all wish we knew what happen

1744
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:03,416
♫ We all wish we had a clue

1745
01:08:08,329 --> 01:08:12,496
♫ The flames they burn,
they burn much faster

1746
01:08:17,078 --> 01:08:21,161
♫ Than you ever think they could

1747
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:29,896
♫ These half-ass walls, they have fallen

1748
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,744
♫ Way before we wished they would

1749
01:08:42,676 --> 01:08:45,926
♫ I was scared as hell

1750
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:50,381
♫ But you were all I felt

1751
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:54,884
♫ I was scared as hell

1752
01:08:55,944 --> 01:08:59,194
♫ As you jumped I fell

1753
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:03,458
♫ I wish I didn't leave

1754
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:08,953
♫ I wish I never crossed the sea

1755
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:13,176
♫ I know it's not my fault

1756
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:16,926
♫ I know it's no one's fault

1757
01:09:18,331 --> 01:09:22,413
♫ Woke up to the flames and fire

1758
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,988
♫ A leap of faith to escape death

1759
01:09:35,773 --> 01:09:39,690
♫ Now death is one step closer

1760
01:09:44,212 --> 01:09:48,380
♫ So let us live this life that's left

1761
01:09:53,311 --> 01:09:57,479
♫ All of the others were the witness

1762
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:05,754
♫ Of the untold nightmare too

1763
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:14,917
♫ We all wish we knew what happen

1764
01:10:19,332 --> 01:10:23,000
♫ We all wish we had a clue

1765
01:10:28,172 --> 01:10:32,340
♫ The flames they burn,
they burn much faster

1766
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:40,884
♫ Than you ever think they could

1767
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:49,539
♫ These half-ass walls, they have fallen

1768
01:10:54,301 --> 01:10:58,468
♫ Way before we wished they would

1769
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:05,521
♫ I was scared as hell

1770
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,070
♫ But you were all I felt

1771
01:11:11,192 --> 01:11:14,442
♫ I was scared as hell

1772
01:11:15,573 --> 01:11:18,823
♫ As you jumped I fell

1773
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:23,134
♫ I wish I didn't leave

1774
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:28,551
♫ I wish I never crossed the sea

1775
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:32,813
♫ I know it's not my fault

1776
01:11:32,813 --> 01:11:37,152
♫ I know it's no one's fault

1777
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:40,402
♫ I was scared as hell

1778
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:45,011
♫ But you were all I felt

1779
01:11:46,162 --> 01:11:49,412
♫ I was scared as hell

1780
01:11:50,396 --> 01:11:53,646
♫ As you jumped I fell
