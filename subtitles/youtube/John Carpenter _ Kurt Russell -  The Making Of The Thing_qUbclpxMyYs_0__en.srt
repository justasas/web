1
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I first became aware of a movie called</font>

2
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing when I saw the original</font>

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,280
through was nineteen<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty two and I</font>

4
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,129
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been about four or five years</font>

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,659
old I think I saw it in re-release it

6
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,639
was one of those films<font color="#E5E5E5"> where as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

7
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,919
watched it it was so frightening that my

8
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,719
popcorn came out of my my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands in other</font>

9
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,239
words when they went up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the door</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

10
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,710
and they had they had this a Geiger

11
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,800
counter he's any they opened the door

12
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:42,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's right there I'm with nuts I'm crazy</font>

13
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,870
then I subsequently<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short</font>

14
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,389
story in high school and I realize it

15
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,039
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot different than the movie what</font>

16
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:51,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">they'd done in the first film was kind</font>

17
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,840
of make the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> james arness monster</font>

18
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,419
more like a Frankenstein creature and

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,340
yes he could he was a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

20
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,709
vegetable that could reproduce various

21
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">life forms but he wasn't the the</font>

22
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,990
imitator the creature that could imitate

23
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,689
any life form from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original story</font>

24
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,439
the john w campbell story who goes there

25
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:13,240
was basically an Agatha Christie kind of

26
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,669
ten little indians you know this

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,280
creature is in your midst and he's

28
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:20,559
imitating either one or all of us whose

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,490
human and who is it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that kind</font>

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an idea really fascinated me so we</font>

31
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,860
went in that sense back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that idea</font>

32
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:33,099
with bill Lancaster and screenplay John

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,230
Carpenter was always our first choice

34
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stewart had some relationship with him</font>

35
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:42,199
school Yoshiko

36
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:47,509
I knew John's work I did not know him

37
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:49,789
and so we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting with him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes yes</font>

38
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes and as soon as we had finished</font>

39
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:52,968
escape from new york<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was being</font>

40
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,608
released i started to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on the thing</font>

41
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:58,009
and we started writing from scratch

42
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,319
basically bill Lancaster wrote an

43
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:02,929
original screenplay and started all over

44
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,149
again there were several drafts of tobe

45
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,680
Hooper had done him I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember his</font>

46
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,109
name now his partner had done a draft

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,480
and there had been some short story

48
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,870
treatments by various people but we

49
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">started over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and studio like what we</font>

50
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">were doing and proved it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and off we went</font>

51
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,098
it was I was reminiscing the other day

52
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:25,160
it was the longest prep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've had on</font>

53
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:26,689
the movie I haven't had one as long

54
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,570
since it was from the time I started

55
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:32,149
going in an office to the time the movie

56
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,469
was released was over a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year the</font>

57
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:35,569
business has changed so much now that

58
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,520
they'll only give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> they try to</font>

59
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,199
shorten your time on either end they try

60
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,719
to make you do it really quickly that

61
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,990
was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the luxuries of the thing was</font>

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have that much time to work on well</font>

63
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short story itself was I wouldn't</font>

64
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">say it was a really great when all</font>

65
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,348
that's a very admired one in the

66
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">science-fiction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realm back in the late</font>

67
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:59,478
30s and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first story</font>

68
00:04:56,658 --> 00:05:02,269
to deal with this this shape-shifting

69
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,819
Body Snatcher type element and all that

70
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:06,408
stuff seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not what a</font>

71
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,839
hundred percent attracted me to the

72
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:11,389
piece it was more the ambience and as

73
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,418
all the characters involved and the mood

74
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:17,300
of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the enclosure elements of the</font>

75
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:19,549
paranoia and the short story was to a

76
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,310
stepping stone to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantages of all</font>

77
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,250
those kinds of elements from the story

78
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,918
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> film I loved the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of being</font>

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">trapped in Antarctica these people</font>

80
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,069
working up there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever reasons</font>

81
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:39,728
horrible winter freezing conditions cold

82
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,728
and is a monster 13

83
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,240
trying to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to how to</font>

84
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,189
approach making the movie is difficult

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,090
each one has its own personality what

86
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:59,430
basically you start with is an idea for

87
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:02,519
a director of<font color="#E5E5E5"> photography you want to</font>

88
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,769
begin meeting production designers you

89
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,500
want to begin the process of setting up

90
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:10,649
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the movie and one of the big</font>

91
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,990
keys to me in making the thing was

92
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:14,729
discovering John Lloyd he said I had

93
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,410
come from low-budget filmmaking and I

94
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,590
had never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in a studio</font>

95
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,470
situation and John I came along with

96
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:26,129
enormous enthusiasm and knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

97
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:29,310
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I but essentially I was working</font>

98
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for universal studio at the time and the</font>

99
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:35,339
thing the script came across my desk and

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,689
I said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> reddit said my god this</font>

101
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,959
is probably the best science<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiction</font>

102
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,879
films i've ever read in my life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

103
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,079
I heard about john carpenter he was

104
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,290
coming on the lot and everybody's

105
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,060
reputation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made a connection with</font>

106
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:52,470
one of the production<font color="#CCCCCC"> managers to talk</font>

107
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,290
to him and then arrange an interview and

108
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,030
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> took my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drawings and things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

109
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,010
talk to John and ended up

110
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:03,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">shawn i met john i'm not sure what year</font>

111
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:08,099
it was but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just before halloween</font>

112
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:13,529
it was it was for Halloween<font color="#CCCCCC"> Deborah Hill</font>

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:18,270
introduced us and we John decided that

114
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:23,729
we would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a good team and</font>

115
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:26,669
so he worked on Halloween<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that I</font>

116
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:31,950
guess was such a good experience for

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:38,100
both of us that we began a series you

118
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:43,589
know and I worked on the fog and escape

119
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:50,070
from new york and then subsequently the

120
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:52,709
thing and so I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went through</font>

121
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:56,430
this over that formative period together

122
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:59,310
you know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work I did with John</font>

123
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,970
and pictures we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did together I think</font>

124
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:07,860
we're at that period some very

125
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:10,620
challenging ones from me and also a lot

126
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">of fun because they allowed us to sort</font>

127
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,720
of experiment and work on visual style

128
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,079
basically it's a process of lining up

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,760
the people to do the movie and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

130
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:25,169
of the crucial decisions we had to make

131
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,779
was on the special<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects and whether</font>

132
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to hire what kind of an effects</font>

133
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,730
person to go with him what kind of a

134
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,750
concept to go with and I chose Robbo

135
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:41,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">team I saw a Halloween and I instantly</font>

136
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,870
became a John Carpenter fan he was you

137
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:47,939
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> film</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just amazing it amazed</font>

138
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:49,980
me and I had the fortune of working on a

139
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,490
picture which was a roger corman film

140
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,269
rock'n'roll high school<font color="#E5E5E5"> I met Dean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cundy</font>

141

he did an amazing job I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Halloween was</font>

142
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:03,329
also big fan of him as a cinematographer

143
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:05,429
director<font color="#CCCCCC"> of photography and I begged him</font>

144
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,259
to introduce me to john carpenter you

145
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:10,859

146
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:14,399
so i went in and i met john and he was

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,660
with a mask and Halloween or whatever as

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,150
a matter of fact I do you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

154
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,500

155
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,329

166
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,509
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very happy and we had a good</font>

167
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:57,059
working relationship and really had a

168
00:09:54,509 --> 00:10:00,429
lot of similar interests and things and

169
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:03,699
he said guess what i'm going to do

170
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:05,439
you know and I said you're kidding

171
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,050
you're gonna remake the thing and he

172
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,720
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so that's the idea around he</font>

173
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:13,870
says I want you to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things right and</font>

174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,940
I went oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god this is fantastic and</font>

175
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:21,909
you know actually after I did the fog I

176
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:26,200
actually did a picture called the

177
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:29,259
howling and it was such a big success

178
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and I was about 20 years old when</font>

179
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:35,110
I did that and I think I finished up a

180
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:38,049
project when I was 21 and John saw the

181
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,120
movie you know and he called me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up one</font>

182
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:42,099
day and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to get in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

183
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,870
we're doing the movie now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're</font>

184
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing the thing yeah you got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

185
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">here he came in with a wild</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

186
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,250
which is that the thing can look like

187
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,100
anything it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

188
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,339
monster it looks like anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out</font>

189
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,528
of this changing shape this imitation

190
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,480
comes all the creatures throughout the

191
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:04,778
universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the thing is ever imitated</font>

192
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,330
and it uses these various forms and rob

193
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:10,269
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very daring in his approach I must</font>

194
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,278
say even sometimes I was doubtful as to

195
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,919
whether he pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off because I got an</font>

196
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:17,470
idea because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta because we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

197
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:23,169

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,369
and tell him what you just told me and

want you two to show what it is you just

218
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,649
told me shot by shot and it's just

219
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:11,678
because he goes that's the only way we

220
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:13,418
can do this thing right so it took a you

221
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:16,509
know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks to get all this</font>

222
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:18,938
stuff down then after we had finished

223
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:21,789
the storyboard process<font color="#E5E5E5"> I piled them all</font>

224
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:25,088
up you know went walking back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

225
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:27,009
know carpenters office and he said let's

226
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,899
see what you got you'd like that and we

227
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,778
pinned them all up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wall covering</font>

228
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,369
all of his office walls then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again he</font>

229
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:35,828
looked at me and he said do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

230
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:39,129
to do all this stuff and I said no you

231
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:41,078
know so that that's what that that was

232
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,860
really the challenge of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that picture and</font>

233
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:46,988
what was great about it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that John</font>

234
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,668
actually did give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great opportunity</font>

235
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:54,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say hey kid you know go nuts you know</font>

236
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:57,129
and use your imagination and he was so

237
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:59,528
supportive during the whole process that

238
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:02,829
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real amazing</font>

239
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:05,528
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to a 22 year old well we</font>

240
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:07,118
started to casting the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

241
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:10,688
realized very quickly that we had to be

242
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:15,489
realistic and although there are women

243
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:16,568
who work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Antarctic and that that</font>

244
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,519
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real thing to put them in</font>

245
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:20,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it's more fun I think I thought at</font>

246
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,100
the time to make this an all male movie

247
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,449
simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you wouldn't have to deal</font>

248
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,709
with that issue they had a girl in the

249
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:30,998
couple of women in Hawks's version and I

250
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,528
thought maybe it would be a more of a

251
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,170
streamlined approach in an all-male

252
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:38,789
movie I hadn't seen one in a long

253
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:41,519
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started casting with Kurt Kurt</font>

254
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:44,099
Russell wanted to play the lead and he

255
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,600
was the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rich pin and we looked</font>

256
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,500
at every good actor we could find and

257
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,278
assembly great chaos<font color="#E5E5E5"> John was trying to</font>

258
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,909
cast the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the role of McCready and we</font>

259
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,649
spent some time together talking about

260
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,179
that thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to think of other</font>

261
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,289
actors I wasn't involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the movie</font>

262
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:06,448
and he was casting the movie and had

263
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:09,958
some of the other roles cast pretty much

264
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:13,919
when he was not finding what he wanted /

265
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,569
McCready and I gave him some suggestions

266
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,919
and we just his friends we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

267
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,300
talking about it and then with a bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

268
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,479
guess it was about three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

269
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:23,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">months maybe less than that he came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

270
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,500
me said would you what would you think

271
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,990
about playing it and so then I really

272
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,100
read it and said yeah I thought it'd be

273
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of fun way at that time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

274
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do definitely as</font>

275
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:36,929
strictly ensemble piece where McCready

276
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:40,289
was just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the group and very</font>

277
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:42,000
slowly came out of the group to have to

278
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,919
sort of deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vein at the very</font>

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">end and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of changed slightly</font>

280
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,120
once we discovered that we had that you

281
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">know these makeup and these wardrobe</font>

282
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,179
problems where everybody looked the same

283
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:52,578
that was asked to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for another</font>

284
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">row like</font>

285
00:14:52,578 --> 00:15:00,678
who left me I can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was</font>

286
00:14:54,798 --> 00:15:03,499
and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got there John and I were</font>

287
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:07,639
talking and we had known each other

288
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:10,970
socially a little bit and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font>

289
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:14,089
what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about Clark the dog</font>

290
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,730
handler he said I haven't really focused

291
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,230
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that role yet and I said well that's</font>

292
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,019
the one that interests me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most and</font>

293
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,639
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and I said yeah he said</font>

294
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,409
why and I said I because there's

295
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about him the fact that he's</font>

296
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:29,659
more connected to the animals than he is

297
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:34,519
to the people I see him as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of</font>

298
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:38,838
loaner sort of strange other entity in

299
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:42,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group and I think he liked</font>

300
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,389
that in it and I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact also he</font>

301
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:46,789
was sort of the red herring the one that

302
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,489
everybody thought was going to be the

303
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:51,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">carrier and we had the whole cast</font>

304
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:53,028
together and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to Universal</font>

305
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,319
and we SAT around the table of the first

306
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:57,860
couple of days and talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

307
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">script and talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what characters</font>

308
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,749
needed and wanted and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lily worked on mostly the psychological</font>

310
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,869
aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it that's what was most</font>

311
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,749
interesting at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that the</font>

312
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,428
script stripped of all the special

313
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:15,290
effects when you first read the script I

314
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:18,259
never read the monster turns here scene

315
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:19,879
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a chance to work on that first</font>

316
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,068
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably good because once we</font>

317
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,850
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> shooting the technical aspects</font>

318
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,399
p.m.

319
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,028
take predominance it ended up being

320
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:32,870
great for me because I I was the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

321
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:38,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to work the most with Jed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wolf</font>

322
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:41,089
dog and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> ral he who raised and</font>

323
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,399
trained Jed and I got to be good friends

324
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,920
and and Jed and I got to be good friends

325
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:50,299
he was a very spooky dog when we started

326
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:52,399
because he was half wolf and half dog

327
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:56,000
and and the wolf half was a real

328
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,610
dominant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and him he he did everything</font>

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,059
like a wolf he would never bar he never

330
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,099
growled but the minute he would become

331
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:08,178
uncomfortable he would just so suddenly

332
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:10,308
go and you just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh oh wait a minute</font>

333
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he did that with me sometimes and</font>

334
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:17,000
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clint had warned me if you see</font>

335
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:19,909
you see this look on his face just relax

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,189
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and relax it you know he's something</font>

337
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:23,390
spooked him in you never knew what was

338
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,269
going to spook him he was not very

339
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">experienced working around people so we</font>

340
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:31,759
had to really lock the set down whenever

341
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:34,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">would Jed was on the stage and because</font>

342
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,769
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one scene where he</font>

343
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,779
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the entire room and went</font>

344
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:43,308
underneath the pool table<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything</font>

345
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:48,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">he had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go past almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in</font>

346
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:51,079
the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we were in rehearsals for</font>

347
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:53,808
two weeks which was it's interesting

348
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,609
John originally I thought it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font>

349
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:58,190
instinct he'd never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it before but</font>

350
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:00,979
to put this group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 12 people together</font>

351
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,870
and then try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what the</font>

352
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,960
dynamics were going to be between them

353
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:08,779
you know who didn't like who who felt

354
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,120
you know who would react this way in

355
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:12,769
this circumstance and we came up a lot

356
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">of very interesting stuff in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

357
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:18,829
process but also we<font color="#CCCCCC"> took some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

358
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:23,149
control away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> John and in the</font>

359
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:28,759
process too because we really bonded and

360
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,410
we got very interestingly involved with

361
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,109
each other

362
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,320
cuz of that I remember at one point in

363
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:37,119
the pre-production John Lloyd came to me

364
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,980
and said okay here's here are our

365
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,489
options we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to go</font>

366
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,620
probably up to British Columbia and

367
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,240
shoot this on a glacier in looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

368
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:53,409
somewhere to build the set before the

369
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,630
Antarctic ice camp they opted for

370
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stewart British Columbia because it was</font>

371
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:02,740
purportedly one of the highest snow

372
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:06,429
falls areas accessible easily we scouted

373
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:10,750
it I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the this summer when</font>

374
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:13,360
it was still warm relatively warm and

375
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,670
the location we had chosen on this

376
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,639
hilltop overlooking at glacier was still

377
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:21,490
essentially dirt so that they could

378
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">build the camp so we were i would say</font>

379
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,240
six months ahead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we would</font>

380
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:28,960
shooting when we would be shooting we

381
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:33,370
were choosing a spot it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little</font>

382
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,490
Knoll on top of a mountain that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

383
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:39,939
accessible by a one-lane<font color="#CCCCCC"> Road that was</font>

384
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,650
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by the mining company the mind</font>

385
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,590
would had only been open briefly and it

386
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,960
was shut down after that so it was kind

387
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:48,699
of a unique thing to find because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

388
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,100
just don't drive on top of glaciers and

389
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,319
you don't do it and here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this place</font>

390
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,509
and it it worked it was just right there

391
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,220
and I the only one problem there were

392
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:59,710
trees to one side so I built the set

393
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,410
side of the set to hide that under

394
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,590
Monell shootings they want to see it but

395
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:09,930
I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely happy with always</font>

396
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:09,929
you know I thought it it looked right

397
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:25,299
my responsibilities were the opening

398
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">title sequence which involved</font>

399
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:34,059
fabrication of the miniature spaceship

400
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:36,279
which was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> built by a person</font>

401
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:39,339
named susan turner this is a spaceship

402
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,920
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opening sequence of thing used</font>

403
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:44,980
in two shots it's principally made of

404
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,050
ABS plastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made out of that so we</font>

405
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">could could help hold all the heat that</font>

406
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:53,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be generated by these hundred and</font>

407
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">forty-four lights we have circulating it</font>

408
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,970
has a lot of brass etched pieces

409
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:03,279
including the grill around the outside

410
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:05,529
the vents<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dome the exhaust I did</font>

411
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,389
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I wanted maximum detail</font>

412
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:10,149
possible which is not possible in my

413
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,040
opinion was styrene I like the brass

414
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,050
it's painted with the many shades of

415
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,990
grades airbrush painted I by hand

416
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:20,319
masking techniques there's also a light

417
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,380
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dome which has made of hammered</font>

418
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,089
brass it was actually flat when it was

419
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,390
etched in it was hammered into shape in

420
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:32,439
would form I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be able to</font>

421
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:34,810
see the lights at a continuous intensity

422
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,640
through the grating instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hot</font>

423
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:38,829
little hot spots or what usually would

424
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,630
get with a grain of wheat light when

425
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:46,269
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infinite values of intensity</font>

426
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,820
and speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this too so when we got in</font>

427
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:50,200
and saw what speed we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

428
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:51,849
out to give the right effect we would

429
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,539
have them we would have the option of

430
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:59,279
making a go making the lights go faster

431
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,279
or slower or be brighter or a dollar

432
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:17,918
we shouted<font color="#CCCCCC"> apogee four passes the</font>

433
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:19,479
spaceship<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the past with the</font>

434
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,730
swirling lights to give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the motion</font>

435
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,339
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is presumably powering the ship</font>

436
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,679
there's another pass with a little light

437
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:30,398
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top in the dome where presumably</font>

438
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:34,419
the the creature is steering the ship

439
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:38,558
and we also shot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mat pass the actual</font>

440
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:40,750
title itself when I did the effect for

441
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,819
the title what I used when the title

442
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,460
comes you know the spaceship flies by

443
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:48,189
and and then the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes and burns</font>

444
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:53,079
on the way that that was done we had

445
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:56,379
like a fish tank that was about<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

446
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:57,908
feet wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> by two feet high and I put</font>

447
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:59,378
smoke in the fish tank and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on the</font>

448
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:02,440
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fish tank I put the title</font>

449
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:05,079
the thing I drew it on an animation cel

450
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,669
behind that I had a piece of garbage<font color="#E5E5E5"> bag</font>

451
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:13,990
plastic which I stretched over a frame

452
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:18,278
and behind that I had a light which was

453
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:21,429
pointed up through the letters and when

454
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:25,298
I photographed it I hit the garbage bag

455
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,860
plastic with a little flame you know

456
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,990
like a match I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would just light it</font>

457
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,729
around the garbage bag plastic and then

458
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,788
the garbage bag plastic would open up

459
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,128
and let the light come through the

460
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:38,230
letters and that's how the letters look

461
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:39,638
like they form and you know and burn on

462
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,538
with the Rays and everything it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

463
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:46,418
actually a very simple process to to do

464
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:49,269
and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good although we went</font>

465
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:53,320
through a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes 11 take actually</font>

466
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:56,649
opened up forming the letters ng I

467
00:23:53,319 --> 00:24:00,158
delivered the spaceship to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Universal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2l</font>

468
00:23:56,648 --> 00:24:02,859
whitlock shop and that's what they used

469
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,929
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> paint from i worked with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with</font>

470
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">Albert Whitlock fur for the first and</font>

471
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:09,909
only time I've worked with him I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

472
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,860
a great fan of his work and he's a man

473
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:14,429
of unique talent he does an amazing

474
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:17,069
amazing things with

475
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:19,350
paint and brush and he did for us he

476
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:22,470
created this giant flying saucer in

477
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:26,398
middle of snow at a scale we couldn't do

478
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:29,429
and he solved some lighting problems for

479
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:33,298
us because painting a snowscape with the

480
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:34,980
correct light on it is not as easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> as as</font>

481
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might think we had to do a lot of</font>

482
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:47,278
work on that but I'm extremely proud of

483
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:50,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">what he did and it worked out great well</font>

484
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:54,028
the career in<font color="#E5E5E5"> university started off</font>

485
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:57,599
really with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boat Hitchcock called me</font>

486
00:24:54,028 --> 00:25:00,359
in and I introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> himself as somebody</font>

487
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,648
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> book with him in England and he</font>

488
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,589
really didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it actually</font>

489
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">laughter I talked to him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while he</font>

490
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:09,868
got to realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

491
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:12,449
were absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentic and then he</font>

492
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:16,859
got interested well after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was</font>

493
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:19,649
torn curtain<font color="#CCCCCC"> marni all the films that he</font>

494
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:23,729
worked on her that he made after that I

495
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:26,398
did work on as he liked doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shots</font>

496
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:31,679
I mean he like doing anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

497
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:34,469
earthquake was a very difficult movie in

498
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,700
as much of universal indulge in the

499
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:41,700
luxury of fucking films<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the movie</font>

500
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,028
houses before they were even started so

501
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,830
there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 week schedule</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

502
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:53,128
were 40 pieces of film to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

503
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:56,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">hindenburg lasted almost a year but</font>

504
00:25:53,128 --> 00:26:00,148
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were 70 odd scenes on that but the</font>

505
00:25:56,249 --> 00:26:02,429
whole film was George Scott's at the end

506
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:04,209
when the film is finished said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's his</font>

508

well a burr<font color="#CCCCCC"> whitlock I had men on</font>

509
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,720
Hindenburg cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had been kind of</font>

510
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:17,109
liaison with Albert on Hindenburg and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

511
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:21,250
knew Albert very well got along with him

512
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:24,549
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and really was I think one of</font>

513
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,400
the shining periods of my career that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

514
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:29,950
got to watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Albert at work and watch</font>

515
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,140
him do all his magic all the matte

516
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,880
paintings had a appropriate storyboard

517
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,730
so we knew generally what you were

518
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,610
supposed to see very often we had an

519
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,460
element<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be a live-action a</font>

520
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:43,929
shunt for component than that and that

521
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,250
would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cut in for the appropriate</font>

522
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:49,480
length and then you would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

523
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,460
until I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Albert delivered his work and</font>

524
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,589
then you just cut in his little

525
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,819
masterpiece in a way you win and they

526
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:59,049
dribbled in all the way through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

527
00:26:54,819 --> 00:27:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">making he would photograph say the</font>

528
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:03,700
bottom half of the frame out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the ice</font>

529
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:07,660
field or the top happened part of it

530
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever was important for that and then</font>

531
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,230
take the film back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood not</font>

532
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,780
develop it he would store it in the

533
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:19,059
refrigerator cutting off just a very

534
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:21,910
small piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they could</font>

535
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:24,579
develop just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or for testing and</font>

536
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:29,440
core line up and then painting a

537
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:31,750
painting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> match so it was actually an</font>

538
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,420
interesting process for me to go through

539
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:38,440
i I've worked with him subsequently a

540
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,509
couple of times to to look at really

541
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of one of the Hollywood masters and</font>

542
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:47,230
how he did his particular about

543
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:50,439
technique but essentially what we did is

544
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:54,400
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a portion of a spaceship</font>

545
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,460
and we planted then Albert what like

546
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,140
created this larger space ship out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

547
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,539
but the big problem is getting the

548
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,870
spaceship there we had to hook up to a

549
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:07,589
helicopter and drop it

550
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:11,819
and then we went to shoot the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> match</font>

551
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:14,429
shots and Albert wanted to wait till

552
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:18,808
evening you know let's get the magic

553
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">colouring and we waited too long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

554
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">helicopter came was waiting and we</font>

555
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:28,169
waited we waited<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally Albert says</font>

556
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,840
once more and the guy said now look this

557
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,100
is it we're leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I never they</font>

558
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,359
all had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this heavy gear and we try to</font>

559
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in a helicopter I couldn't get the</font>

560
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,539
door shut so regardless of that we took

561
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:41,879
off I mean that was it was the end of

562
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,529
the day and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy gets partway</font>

563
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,480
toward the can't he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> my god I think</font>

564
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:50,519
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run out of fuel nope and</font>

565
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,558
then I say well if we run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel a</font>

566
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,808
little happen well with this land he

567
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,678
said well spend the night and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

568
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:57,629
imagine spending the night news

569
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,750
helicopter was six or eight people you

570
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:04,470
know it's but we did we finally made it

571
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:06,480
back and everybody was happy except the

572
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,950
pilot he said he<font color="#CCCCCC"> really we didn't</font>

573
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,250
realize you know really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font>

574
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:14,250
trouble we were in but again ignorance

575
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,990
is bliss and in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases that we had</font>

576
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a piece of high ground on the</font>

577
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,450
backlog because I didn't like working

578
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,700
from a tower unnecessarily anyway

579
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:27,450
because the back lot at that time is

580
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:30,420
very plain and very hilly so we found a

581
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:33,179
high spot and laid the sheets out and

582
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:36,000
just place the people in the appropriate

583
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,759
position the vital issue in making a

584
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">match of work is having things standing</font>

585
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,980
in space if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't look as though</font>

586
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,879
what your painting is actually in space

587
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,490
dimensionally in space receiving problem

588
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,190
which doesn't necessarily simply mean

589
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,859
the dissipation of color and tone that's

590
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:59,009
simple but still<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the feeling that</font>

591
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:00,869
it's best standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in space you don't</font>

592
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:05,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">achieve that you don't achieve anything</font>

593
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:09,539
just looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a painting remains</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

594
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">dimensional that's the main thing you're</font>

595
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:14,569
worried mming at clouds of course help

596
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,570
you get there

597
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:27,608
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were looking for</font>

598
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:30,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">was how to really create the feeling of</font>

599
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:32,558
cold how to get breath from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actors</font>

600
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:35,378
mouths and we'd heard all the various

601
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,388
stories that you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the film</font>

602
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:40,569
business had been trying up till<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

603
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:42,908
The Lost Horizon stories and so forth

604
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:45,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that refrigerating the</font>

605
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:48,129
stages was really sort of the best thing

606
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:51,368
we found out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't have to be</font>

607
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:53,319
really cold as long as the humidity<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

608
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:56,108
up so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a very careful balancing</font>

609
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:59,348
act of humidifying the air spraying

610
00:30:56,108 --> 00:31:02,558
water over head to bring the that and

611
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:05,528
then bring the temperature down which

612
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:09,190
happened at one of the hottest summers

613
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:11,528
in Los Angeles in a long time so it was

614
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,828
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange for us to work in this very</font>

615
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:17,288
kind of cold environment and then step

616
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:19,298
outside in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Park is in 102 degree</font>

617
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:21,940
heat to watch the tourists going by on

618
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:24,578
the transit on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour and have them</font>

619
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,818
wonder why are these people wearing less

620
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:30,519
clothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was sweltering so more</font>

621
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:32,469
people got flu and cold and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pic</font>

622
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,838
they'd come out wearing that Parker

623
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:36,879
freezing they come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the sweltering</font>

624
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:38,948
they take off that Parker now they're

625
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:41,769
hot then they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back in they put it</font>

626
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:43,959
back on it was so confusing the thing

627
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,229
that I remember the most was all of us

628
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:50,259
we got so tired of changing to go to

629
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:52,659
lunch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to lunch in</font>

630
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:55,118
our complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> little outfits in this</font>

631
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:57,339
brutal heat and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and just</font>

632
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:58,928
kind of blow it off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go well it's</font>

633
00:31:57,338 --> 00:32:00,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be real hot getting over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

634
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,359
and then I'll get there will be

635
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:04,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">air-conditioned and it won't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

636
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:08,078
terrible I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I also remember</font>

637
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:10,149
for about three days or so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> showed</font>

638
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:13,690
up in the commissary<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day with a</font>

639
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:15,908
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> ugly bullet hole in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my phone to eat</font>

640
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,859
lunch the end you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wouldn't</font>

641
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:19,449
come in and I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you should</font>

642
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:21,038
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> put me in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a corner where</font>

643
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:23,169
everybody doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at me</font>

644
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,118
because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty disgusting but and</font>

645
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:27,099
there were other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who showed up</font>

646
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:29,769
you know with pieces of them hanging off

647
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:32,289
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lunch it was</font>

648
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:34,329
we were we were quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sighted on the</font>

649
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:38,170
universal out there the thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me was</font>

650
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:42,519
on the thing was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the production</font>

651
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:45,160
designing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie was so perfect</font>

652
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,789
that my job was easier I could

653
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">concentrate instead on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> acting</font>

654
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:55,089
telling the story and the monster I mean

655
00:32:53,349 --> 00:33:00,459
that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big job was to convince the</font>

656
00:32:55,089 --> 00:33:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience that this thing is real and we</font>

657
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,750
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have convinced him a little too</font>

658
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,750
much

659
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:16,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">robbo Tina has a great sort of strange</font>

660
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,919
imagination and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course is his</font>

661
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:21,950
characters likewise the the creatures

662
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so forth I was really intrigued and</font>

663
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,610
challenged by the fact that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

664
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:28,759
doing some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't been done</font>

665
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:31,219
up to that point in creating these

666
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:33,740
illusions we tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of things</font>

667
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,220
cranking the camera faster and slower

668
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,899
and and under cranking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shooting the</font>

669
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:44,089
camera upside down to the backwards

670
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:45,589
action looked somehow strange a lot of

671
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:48,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of photographic</font>

672
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:51,470
techniques one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tricks</font>

673
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:55,729
with working with rubber whether it's

674
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:57,500
you know a mask or a makeup appliance or

675
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:01,940
whether it's completely fabricated

676
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:05,450
creature is is lighting it carefully so

677
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:08,659
that it it looks real so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

678
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:11,000
you don't give away the tricks the

679
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,470
little seams in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paint and the wires</font>

680
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

681
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:20,000
necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and rob was</font>

682
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,918
rob was always very sensitive about his

683
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,068
creatures there was you know whether

684
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,078
there was too much light on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it we</font>

685
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:30,409
always sort of joked that if it was up

686
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,450
to rob he would build the creatures you

687
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,720
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be incredibly interesting an</font>

688
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:37,908
imaginative and then not put any light

689
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,039
on him because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was afraid of showing</font>

690
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,500
them so it was always a case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob</font>

691
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:44,418
wanting less light less light you know

692
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,699
so we we developed techniques of little

693
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,318
tiny spots of light and shadows and also

694
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,378
that you you never really looked

695
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:53,210
blatantly at a rubber creature I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

696
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:55,489
visit Rob on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set he wanted me to</font>

697
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">help shoot some tests that he was doing</font>

698
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:02,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was vibrating dog and I think when I</font>

699
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:05,239
got there there were so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-gallon</font>

700
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:09,799
pails of KY jelly all over the place

701
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:12,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like my my impression of the</font>

702
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,680
film was GI I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

703
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,019
like buy KY jelly and in you know

704
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,619
five-gallon pails and have so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

705
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:22,519
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

706
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:24,679
in any one place you know they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

707
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:27,199
much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe on all of all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

708
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:29,389
his creatures but that's kind of what I

709
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,639
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of when I when I you know think of</font>

710
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:34,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on the health and you'd walk</font>

711
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,539
into their model room we see what they

712
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:37,670
were going to eventually come up with

713
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:40,880
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were modeling clay I guess</font>

714
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:45,079
before they started the workmen making

715
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:48,200
you and it was incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see and i</font>

716
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,900
must confess i think i spent about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

717
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">days with them all told they molded my</font>

718
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:57,110
face and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expressions</font>

719
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,360
then with my hands my legs<font color="#CCCCCC"> torso they</font>

720
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:01,910
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> took photographs of my chest</font>

721
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,400
without a shirt on and they assigned one

722
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:07,369
person to make the hair pattern match

723
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,519
and it was so good but the day we shot

724
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:13,699
the sequence of my chest exploding<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

725
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:15,619
inside the examining table that my body

726
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:17,449
was supposed to be lying so that when

727
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:20,150
head was out it was really my head my

728
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:21,439
neck my shoulders and my arms and

729
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:26,720
everything else was the model<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

730
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">richard dysart is an old alma and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> played</font>

731
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,969
the doctor the medical doctor came in

732
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,990
that morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was already in the</font>

733
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:38,029
harness and he said but some clothes on

<font color="#CCCCCC">that guy for god sakes disgusting and it</font>

735
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,840
came running over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it wasn't until he</font>

736
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,659
was right on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tommy didn't realize that</font>

737
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,970
was fake it was so<font color="#CCCCCC"> incredible when I see</font>

738
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:48,230
the picture I know what my chest hair

739
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:51,259
pattern looks like from looking at

740
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself married for 50 years I'm shot how</font>

741
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,060
accurate is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually uh it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

742
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:58,189
funny because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a one-take</font>

743
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:00,349
situation we had to make him up and

744
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,329
blend this whole body off that had this

745
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:05,089
interior mechanism that would rip open

746
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:08,809
right and what happened was is of course

747
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:11,690

lighting you know getting it all set up

753
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,840

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:33,039
you know but that wasn't the end of it

785
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,299
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about 6 30 or seven by</font>

786
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,869
filming at the second gen I spent the

787
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,550
entire day strapped in his harness took

788
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,500
my back a week or two to recover but

789
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,850
that everyone was pleasant fact the

790
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,619

<font color="#E5E5E5">me when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually get to the scene or</font>

794
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:58,329
the actual shot within the sequence

795
00:38:54,369 --> 00:39:01,510
where of who you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nora sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie</font>

796
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:03,069
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a stomach open and it's</font>

797
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:06,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to bite down on the</font>

798
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:09,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">doctors arms you know what we did is we</font>

799
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:12,219
came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it on a shot where you would</font>

800
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:16,539
actually see the mechanism open and we

801
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:19,779
had you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor and actually</font>

802
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:22,059
put his arms in and then start to close

803
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,580
the machine right and then we cut and

804
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,650
what we do is is we come to another

805
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,440
angle right where we've actually

806
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:33,970
replicated the

807
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,970
doctors arms perfectly making it out of

808
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:41,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">jell-o right we made the arms at a jello</font>

809
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:44,078
we had wax bones built into the arms and

810
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:46,088
we had rubber veins and gelatin veins

811
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,450
and all this stuff so it was like you

812
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:52,210
know living tissue and at this point

813
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:54,368
what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually took a mold</font>

814
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,490
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actors face that was playing the</font>

815
00:39:54,369 --> 00:40:00,970
doctor and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

816
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:04,389
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that had no arms his arms</font>

817
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:07,779
were actually cut off here right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an</font>

818
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:10,960
injury an industrial accident right and

819
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:15,640
a very very great job guy you know this

820
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:19,150
guy and we basically made a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prosthetic</font>

821
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:22,809
that actually looked exactly like the

822
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:27,910
doctor included on this person's face

823
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we glued the gelatin arms on to his</font>

824
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:33,068
arms right so we have him in there and

825
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,900
what happens is that the stomach is

826
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:36,190
actually hydraulic you know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's made</font>

827
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,470
out of something that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like you</font>

828
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">know same device that a tractor works</font>

829
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,759
with and could<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up you know a lot of</font>

830
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when this thing</font>

831
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,470
slammed shut it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> rips right</font>

832
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:49,300
through the jello punctures the plastic

833
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:51,909
things which sends blood flying all over

834
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:55,180
the place and then the you know the

835
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:57,909
actor but no arms it pulls his arms out

836
00:40:55,179 --> 00:41:01,210
and now he's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the prosthetic</font>

837
00:40:57,909 --> 00:41:04,210
damage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know on and blood shooting</font>

838
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,800
all over the place you know and that's a

839
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,510
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good shot in a movie you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

840
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,269
mean that that that one was really tough

841
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:12,700
to do and very inventive you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

842
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:19,900
tough to do I would even be scared to do

843
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:21,549
that again that sequence is so etched in

844
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,500
the minds of people who see this movie

845
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,810
everywhere I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been in the world</font>

846
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,059
someone has spoken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and I could you</font>

847
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:31,029
know everywhere I've ever been I do a

848
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:32,828
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traveling someone comes up to me</font>

849
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,630
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street and speaks to me about</font>

850
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:36,670
that movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> in about that sequence</font>

851
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:40,240
specifically then we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>

852
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:42,740
start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the footage of his</font>

853
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,659
head coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and you know I</font>

854
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:46,549
sleep for this shot couldn't use Charlie

855
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:50,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">hallahan right so he actually made like</font>

856
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:55,910
a perfect replica of this guy's head and

857
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:57,920
and fully you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know animated it you know</font>

858
00:41:55,909 --> 00:42:02,269
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mechanical effects and whatnot</font>

859
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,130
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in it had a hydraulic ram</font>

860
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually stretch the neck out</font>

861
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and sever the rubber at exactly a</font>

862
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,949
perfect point and again this was only

863
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:12,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you could only do it in one take</font>

864
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:14,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right and when it when it stretches</font>

865
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:16,189
open and the skin rips what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

866
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:18,139
see inside was something that was very

867
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,240
reminiscent of like what's in a comic

868
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:22,639
book where we see you stretching if it's

869
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,469
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really stringy stuff so we really</font>

870
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,519
didn't know how to make that stuff you

871
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:28,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

872
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,019
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stretch that far so what we did</font>

873
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:33,559
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just started you know melting</font>

874
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:35,480
plastic and and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> bubble gum you</font>

875
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,789
know in making this crazy concoction

876
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,619
that I'm sure was like so toxic you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

877
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,779
is it couldn't be good for you right

878
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:42,980
what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we right before the shot</font>

879
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,280
you know we had you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

880
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,710
replica of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hallahan body and we actually</font>

881
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,080
had this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this goo that we would pile in</font>

882
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,820
there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick and and the whole</font>

883
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,369
time it's giving off fumes like paint

884
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:58,070
thinner and lacquer thinner at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

885
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:59,480
kind of stuff and again we have effects

886
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,869
guys buried in the little table

887
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,460
underneath to operate the stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

888
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:05,900
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have rehearsed the</font>

889
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,449
motion of the neck coming off and

890
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,550
everything without doing a split camera

891
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:13,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">setup right everybody's going like</font>

892
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:15,289
what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> smell you know and I'm going</font>

893
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:17,809
oh it's the you know it's a stuff inside

894
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:19,159
the neck<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know some nutty concoction</font>

895
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:21,529
we made<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will stretch you know</font>

896
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:22,579
bubblegum and whatnot plastic melted

897
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,710
down there going like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it doesn't</font>

898
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:25,969
smell<font color="#CCCCCC"> too good you know so go well we</font>

899
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,590
better hurry up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and shoot it right so</font>

900
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:29,449
camera said everything's ready and then

901
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,960
carpenter goes wait wait a minute wait a

902
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:35,569
minute shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> there be fire he like</font>

903
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,369
underneath the the lands<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you know</font>

904
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,990
everybody goes why and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes well</font>

905
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:41,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they're burning they're burning</font>

906
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:43,519
everything around them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

907
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,690
shot where the you know like the you

908
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:45,980
know the head stretching off but

909
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody's seeing it so just for</font>

910
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,480
continuity want a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

911
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,039
foreground you know meantime nobody's

912
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,530
thinking about it and I didn't either

913
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,179
but the room is filling up with you know

914
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,930
explosive fumes

915
00:43:56,179 --> 00:44:01,578
right so so finally you know the effects

916
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,719
guy gets a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire you know there's like a</font>

917
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,039
thing called a fire bar which is

918
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a pipe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a bunch of little</font>

919
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:07,818
holes drilled in it much like you know

920
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:10,670
you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a fireplace it works</font>

921
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:13,338
<font color="#E5E5E5">with gas puts it underneath the lens out</font>

922

<font color="#E5E5E5">just so shocked at months of work</font>

952
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:33,500
preparing for this moment was just blown

953
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,970
to bits and just a second so we you know

954
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,219

my god we had to set up take a whole

957
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,909
nother day to get back to this point and

958
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:46,309
finally just accomplished the one shot

959
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:49,519
where they had stretches and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

960
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:51,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours all of us had had made a trip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

961
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,929
the shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to get this little thing</font>

962
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:54,818
done for my head

963
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:58,239
everything we all made a trip over there

964
00:45:54,818 --> 00:46:02,440
some of them like David and Charlie had

965
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,779
to have very complicated things done so

966
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,429
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent much time there but when</font>

967
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,490
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were at the shop Robert already</font>

968
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:12,639
started sculpting a lot of the things

969
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:15,129
like he's scope to<font color="#CCCCCC"> diffuse bodies that</font>

970
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,078
we find in the Norwegian camp and that

971
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,970
was lying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the floor when I walked by</font>

972
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,519
the first time and I just remember

973
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:24,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking this is this is incredible art</font>

974
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,318
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an amazing grotesque art that</font>

975
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:29,199
he's created here the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing with</font>

976
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,838
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big fused dog think it was actually</font>

977
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">before they put all the hair and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

978
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,849
slime and everything and I'll that pink

979
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:40,720
slime that will let drippy stuff in it

980
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the pieces of king crab claws or</font>

981
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,769
whatever the hell he used for that

982
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:48,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">before he put all that stuff on it it</font>

983
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:51,818
was an amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of sculpture just</font>

984
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:55,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful I mean grotesque horrible but</font>

985
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:58,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">also very beautiful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I did was I</font>

986
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:00,880
was so you know wanting this stuff to

987
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:03,970
come out so great I actually lived

988
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,059
universal for a year and five weeks

989
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:09,789
without taking a day off I work you know

990
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:11,829
seven days a week never took a day off

991
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:14,139
you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their night and day</font>

992
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:16,119
night and dad sleep on the sets you know

993
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:18,639
a carpenter would come in where's Rob

996
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,460

997
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,390
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to shoot this thing or</font>

998
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:30,579
whatever and I ended up you know working

999
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:33,279
so hard that I ended up in the hospital

1000
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:35,829
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show john looked at me</font>

1001
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,089
he said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't look well think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1002
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:39,818
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this guy to the hospital</font>

1003
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:42,909
right you know but since then you know

1004
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:46,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've wised up and you know it's uh I</font>

1005
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:49,088
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to</font>

1006
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:51,909
the creature effects on on the thing

1007
00:47:49,088 --> 00:47:55,750
it's this is rob obtains movie I mean

1008
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:57,670
and there was no kind of no loss for you

1009
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,679
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible effects it was it was a</font>

1010
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:03,820
pretty hungry movie when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets down to</font>

1011
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:07,899
that aspect of it we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in actually</font>

1012
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:10,240
with you know Rob's request because it

1013
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,849
was an overload period where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he</font>

1014
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,149
had sum some seven million creature

1015
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:20,019
effects going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and talked to me about</font>

1016
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:22,539
possibly picking up one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effects</font>

1017
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:24,759
as some of the overload which happened

1018
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:28,659
to be the the dog thing at the beginning

1019
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:32,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie it was we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting</font>

1020
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:34,779
heavily into this new element of

1021
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,869
puppetry and animatronics coming

1022
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:41,350
together at my studio and since I like

1023
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:45,639
Rob a lot and I've also worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> John</font>

1024
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:48,969
Carpenter before and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a fairly fun</font>

1025
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:50,889
and simple situation for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1026
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,719
jumped into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

1027
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:55,179
effects that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in the movie these</font>

1028
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:59,289
dogs have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been taken over by by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1029
00:48:55,179 --> 00:49:01,960
thing so I attacked it in a way of

1030
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:05,050
figuring out a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do it</font>

1031
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,050
simplistically how to do quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1032
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:11,530
economically and also create a you know

1033
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:15,850
a pretty nifty effect and so we attacked

1034
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:19,480
it as literally a puppet so when you do

1035
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:21,039
see this effect in the movie I remember

1036
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:25,090
looking at myself in the mirror I'm

1037
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:26,679
going how how easily can I puppet

1038
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,019
something if this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head because</font>

1039
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:32,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're just starting to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into puppetry</font>

1040
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:35,199
at that point in our studio and had<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

1041
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:38,889
do a snapshot of me just holding my hand

1042
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:41,079
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a human being so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

1043
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:43,509
was this is about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intricate and</font>

1044
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:47,380
amazing a machine anybody could build

1045
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:49,420
and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that snapshot of me</font>

1046
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,150
standing it just like this with my hand

1047
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:56,170
just like this we designed the dog thing

1048
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:59,440
over that though it was formed following

1049
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,720
function we did not create freely we

1050
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,789
created based on the machine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1051
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:06,189
going to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this thing work and</font>

1052
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:08,320
when you actually see this dog thing in

1053
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:10,298
the movie you will see that there's this

1054
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,009
hump this interesting hump it is

1055
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:14,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes out this really cool</font>

1056
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:16,088
head that comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's snarling</font>

1057
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,910
and going through all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these gyrations</font>

1058
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:21,009
and it has all this wonderful organic

1059
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:23,018
movement and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically because all</font>

1060
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:25,329
that organic movement is the person

1061
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:27,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside it who was disguised by the</font>

1062
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:30,729
design so it came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a concept</font>

1063
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:33,009
designed to that concept and literally

1064
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:36,368
built a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool hand puppet with an</font>

1065
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:39,489
animatronic face we literally came in to

1066
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:42,219
help out to take a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1067
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:44,409
overload and to do a really fun

1068
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:48,489
character and a neat creature and a neat

1069
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:50,889
effect but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit and</font>

1070
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:53,769
it wasn't for the film it wasn't my film

1071
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:56,170
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob's film and he should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

1072
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:59,169
proud of it I'm thrilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> for him and I'm</font>

1073
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:01,900
I think what he did standing some of the

1074
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:04,059
neatest effects we've seen and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> glad</font>

1075
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:09,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a cool effect in the film</font>

1076
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:12,009
the big scene in the kennel thing first

1077
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:14,979
makes its appearance set it on fire

1078
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:17,079
flame through and then put out the fire

1079
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:18,968
was one of the most exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I've</font>

1080
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,789
ever worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or eight</font>

1081
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:23,409
cameras nine actors with fire

1082
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:25,599
extinguisher and we really had win and

1083
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:28,149
put out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fire and the state was</font>

1084
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,709
elevated 15 feet or so above the floor

1085
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,389
so there were real<font color="#E5E5E5"> firemen underneath</font>

1086
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:35,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was a lot of safety apparatus for</font>

1087
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:40,328
us but I remember that you know usually

1088
00:51:35,018 --> 00:51:42,938
we roll them marker action all those

1089
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:45,099
cameras clacking him flames building up

1090
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:47,558
from the gas jets and us waiting and

1091
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:48,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finally the call we always really</font>

1092
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:51,219
put out that fire it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

1093
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:54,039
wonderful the kennel sequence is

1094
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:56,259
basically broken into two areas which is

1095
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,719
one first a dog transforming in front of

1096
00:51:56,259 --> 00:52:01,028
the dogs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the point which humans</font>

1097
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,249
see it and at the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> at which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1098
00:52:01,028 --> 00:52:05,650
human see it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> important to</font>

1099
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:07,389
also understand that what again we were

1100
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,729
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at was in amorphous shape that</font>

1101
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:14,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you could really call a thing</font>

1102
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:16,358
so when the big mass or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dog or what</font>

1103
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,949
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is transformed to pulls itself up in</font>

1104
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:20,108
the corner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ceiling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying</font>

1105
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:21,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to back up an escape you know from these</font>

1106
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:24,009
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dogs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything it just</font>

1107
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:24,339
wants to be left alone you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1108
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:26,559
no

1109
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:28,119
to go you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so basically you know</font>

1110
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,099
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are looking at it and they go</font>

1111
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:32,528
to torch it and what happens is that it

1112
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:35,259
you know rips open and then this you

1113
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:37,028
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strange kind of</font>

1114
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:39,009
formation comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks much like</font>

1115
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:41,739
a flower and in essence if you go back

1116
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:43,869
and you know freeze frame what it

1117
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:45,579
actually is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a flower it's it's</font>

1118
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:48,400
about like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many dog</font>

1119
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:50,950
tongues it's a bunch of dog tongues and

1120
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,769
there's dog teeth growing out of the out

1121
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:56,199
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wanted something</font>

1122
00:52:53,768 --> 00:52:58,209
there that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you know in</font>

1123
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:01,989
the mind would sort of be you know

1124
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:04,179
something the dog used to be and has now

1125
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:06,759
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know changed into something that is</font>

1126
00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:08,919
like a twisted nightmare the burn<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1127
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:14,139
remember the burn when when David

1128
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:16,509
Clinton's eruption and then we burned

1129
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:18,518
him at us that was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

1130
00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:21,849
effector that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all worked and the guy</font>

1131
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:24,728
who did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the burn Alyssa understand but</font>

1132
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:28,059
he's a specialist at<font color="#CCCCCC"> dunnes full body</font>

1133
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:31,328
burns and that was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive and</font>

1134
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:34,690
spooky to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of because what</font>

1135
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:36,999
happens is he's got he can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> breathe</font>

1136
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,309
once he's ready to go because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1137
00:53:36,998 --> 00:53:40,778
congressional<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sierra's lungs he has to</font>

1138
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:44,289
do the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing holding his breath</font>

1139
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:47,259
and it's all a matter of timing and then

1140
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:50,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute he came off he had to be put</font>

1141
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:53,469
out and immediately you know freed so he

1142
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:54,910
could draw a breath and soon when I

1143
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:57,429
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the effects that</font>

1144
00:53:54,909 --> 00:54:00,998
Rob head and created there was one in

1145
00:53:57,429 --> 00:54:02,828
particular one<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular sequence where</font>

1146
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:05,259
Charlie how a hands head comes off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1147
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:07,479
table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tongue shoots out and it</font>

1148
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:09,789
pulls across turns over and grows stocks

1149
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:13,328
and lots of 12th floor when I saw that I

1150
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:15,339
realized a great sense of relief because

1151
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:18,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I didn't want to end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font>

1152
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:20,228
this movie was a guy in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a suit see I</font>

1153
00:54:18,248 --> 00:54:21,998
grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a kid watching science</font>

1154
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:25,868
fiction in western movies and it was

1155
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:28,129
always a guy in a suit or sometimes it

1156
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:29,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bad puppet like</font>

1157
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,910
if conquered the world comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mind</font>

1158
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:33,769
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roger Corman's movies and a</font>

1159
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:36,589
vegetable monster kind of going like

1160
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:39,170
this wooden<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee and my fear was they'll</font>

1161
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:42,050
laugh at us you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know delica there'll be</font>

1162
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:44,059
a joke I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> even as great as the movie</font>

1163
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:46,940
was an alien was a terrific movie it's

1164
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:49,849
still in the very end up stood this big

1165
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,289
guy in a suit no I don't want to do a

1166
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:54,110
suit you know I want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1167
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:58,849
that's alive so I was when I saw that

1168
00:54:54,110 --> 00:55:01,160
stuff coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I was like man now</font>

1169
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:03,409
there were some effects we had to fool

1170
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:06,349
with they didn't work perfectly does

1171
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:07,549
this stuff is not like his<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob said to</font>

1172
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:09,769
me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like ordering pizza on the</font>

1173
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone you have to build it and create it</font>

1174
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:15,849
and sometimes it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work in our</font>

1175
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:15,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">case I think it did</font>

1176
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:32,660
you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fucking kidding</font>

1177
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:34,909
bravoteens did the special makeup

1178
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:36,949
effects and Roy are big ass did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1179
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:39,769
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> special effects the explosions and</font>

1180
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:43,069
so forth but they work together in one

1181
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:46,340
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was in terms of certain</font>

1182
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:49,160
construction for the thing certain size

1183
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rob couldn't handle in other words his</font>

1184
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:53,899
little team could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far so they</font>

1185
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:58,070
enter intermeshed at one point and begin

1186
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:01,099
a collaboration to pull off that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last a</font>

1187
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:03,170
creature coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up coming up out of the</font>

1188
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:06,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">floor and opening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up that was a huge</font>

1189
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:08,930
monstrosity<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of it was amazing</font>

1190
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:11,780
so we had a lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the first</font>

1191
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:13,519
part which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the pass where he</font>

1192
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,110
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to run underneath the</font>

1193
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,719
floorboards that was done by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roy</font>

1194
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arbogast and what they did was they</font>

1195
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:22,369
built actually like a train track

1196
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,860
underneath the floorboards they put like

1197
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:27,259
a huge ball metal ball on it and they

1198
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:30,470
actually dragged it with a huge table

1199
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:32,390
mounted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a winch that actually was a</font>

1200
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:33,799
high speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> winch they just flipped the</font>

1201
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,819
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then this ball would roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1202
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,289
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just break all the</font>

1203
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:39,080
floorboards up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look very</font>

1204
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:41,179
impressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what we what we see is</font>

1205
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:44,119
the floor being ripped up and now we see

1206
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:46,519
this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> image of Wilford Brimley</font>

1207
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:50,089
rising up by out of this hole you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1208
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:51,469
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuck to a huge tentacle you</font>

1209
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:54,289
know with all these tentacles that were

1210
00:56:51,469 --> 00:56:56,119
riding off of it his chest actually rips

1211
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:59,449
open this dog starts to struggle out and

1212
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:03,769
because we wanted to open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope</font>

1213
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:08,750
of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were seeing we decided to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1214
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:11,000
animation and there's this guy you know

1215
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,860
a randy cook who's brilliant at

1216
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,199
stop-motion animation i worked with

1217
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Randy before and known known for quite a</font>

1218
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,609
while and asked him if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would actually</font>

1219
00:57:17,389 --> 00:57:21,469
do this you know the wide shot which

1220
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,090
would basically be the worm you know the

1221
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:24,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">Blair monster you know comes up through</font>

1222
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor and now we were back really</font>

1223
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:29,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">far we see oh god it's huge you know and</font>

1225
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:34,789
you know and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we'll cut to</font>

1226
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:36,920
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> medium shot of the dog actually</font>

1227
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:39,559
starting to rip through you know

1228
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,570
Brimley's you know chest and then we'll

1229
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:43,309
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the wide shot and actually</font>

1230
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:46,010
see the dog bleep out and land on the

1231
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:49,009
floor right in front of Kurt and so

1232
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:51,140
actually Randy and his crew set to

1233
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,330
making a miniature version of the whole

1234
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:56,239
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was absolute beautiful didn't you</font>

1235
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:58,969
know really wonderful the miniatures for

1236
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:01,639
the sequence there goes in was inside a

1237
00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:05,239
room that had a lot of oil cans and some

1238
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:08,719
other miniature pieces I can't explain

1239
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:10,699
exactly you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is guy named</font>

1240
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,559
Jim Bella<font color="#CCCCCC"> hovik and again susan turner</font>

1241
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:14,719
who built the spaceship for the

1242
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of the film Randy I screen</font>

1243
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,829
Randy cook the animator asked me to make

1244
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,349
it on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-and-a-half-inch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a quick</font>

1245
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:23,989
scale that seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a good size for</font>

1246
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:25,610
him to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we made a rather</font>

1247
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:28,129
large one and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be</font>

1248
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:30,559
very solid to do dimensional animation

1249
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,420
you have to have a very solid solid base

1250
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,610
and we made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very solid made it so</font>

1251
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:37,070
apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke away so when the floor</font>

1252
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:39,530
exploded Randy could get right in there

1253
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:41,000
and work additionally when we built it

1254
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:44,030
we built it with no supports in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1255
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,530
middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the floor so that they could</font>

1256
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:48,769
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the creature come up at any point</font>

1257
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:50,600
we hadn't quite decided yet and of

1258
00:58:48,769 --> 00:58:53,030
course we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> icicles hanging from the</font>

1259
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:55,670
top which were use<font color="#CCCCCC"> silicon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for because I</font>

1260
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,830
couldn't be moved either you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know frame</font>

1261
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,269
by frame shooting you can't you can't

1262
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:01,849
disturb anything everything has to stay

1263
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:05,239
exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried a copy of the</font>

1264
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:08,000
live set exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it was rather</font>

1265
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:11,089
difficult with the ice cave because it

1266
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,769
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just jagged cave and so we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1267
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:14,360
had to measure each bar part out and

1268
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:16,880
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the right to mention so</font>

1269
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:19,190
it would match I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it look</font>

1270
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely I know a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people like</font>

1271
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take shortcuts but I do I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1272
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,340
look exactly right because I think

1273
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no substitution for having it be</font>

1274
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:30,170
exactly right mathematically and

1275
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:32,389
visually in the final picture what

1276
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:35,720
happened was his carpenter had it the

1277
00:59:32,389 --> 00:59:38,179
sequence cut together and felt that at

1278
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:39,859
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day his I could attack</font>

1279
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:42,349
that there was you know stop motion

1280
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,539
animation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture and at this</font>

1281
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:45,069
point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the</font>

1282
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:47,469
you know since it was done you know many

1283
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:49,330
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago you know we actually didn't</font>

1284
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:50,709
have the use of a computer which would

1285
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:53,949
kind of you know smooth out the

1286
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:55,809
animation a little bit and so you know

1287
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:57,339
John decided that now we're not going to

1288
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the animation in the picture you</font>

1289
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:16,960
know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it was beautifully</font>

1290
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:19,960
executed we all met at vancouver airport

1291
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:23,199
and then we were going to fly to Prince

1292
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:28,150
Rupert where we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a plane</font>

1293
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:29,379
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stuart British Columbia so we we flew</font>

1294
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">into Prince Rupert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we were coming</font>

1295
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,680
down we realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> snowstorm</font>

1296
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it'd be a little</font>

1297
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:37,269
dicey if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a small</font>

1298
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:39,220
plane and flying to Stuart so we get

1299
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:41,500
into Prince Rupert and around eleven

1300
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:43,899
o'clock at night they heard the entire

1301
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast and this huge like Greyhound bus or</font>

1302
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:48,579
something by now it's continuing to snow

1303
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:50,139
and snow is getting deep we're driving

1304
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:53,019
along I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember Peter Maloney was sick</font>

1305
01:00:50,139 --> 01:00:54,849
from from eating something and everybody

1306
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:56,920
was kind of falling asleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

1307
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:58,989
it's the low love that that buses<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1308
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,909
driving more and we're all just about

1309
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:05,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of it and suddenly we hear the bus</font>

1310
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">driver yells out slide slide so we all</font>

1311
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:09,519
wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the bus literally slides and</font>

1312
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:10,840
it starts going almost like off the

1313
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">mountain I thought it was gonna like</font>

1314
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,130
back bounce off the mountain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1315
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,690
ricochet and throw us off the other side

1316
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,610
there was no guardrail or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1317
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,570
it just plummeted for a thousand feet

1318
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:23,470
because we're in the middle of these

1319
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:25,690
snow covered mountains and so now if

1320
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:29,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was a movie you cut to the next</font>

1321
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:31,599
shot all the whole cast we are up in

1322
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:34,239
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bus surrounding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bus</font>

1323
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,889
driver with our eyes completely open and

1324
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,779
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> driving it by ten miles an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hour</font>

1325
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:41,379
now and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of glued to thee</font>

1326
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:43,210
we're glued to the road but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maloney's</font>

1327
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:46,269
still in the back it means he's sleeping

1328
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:48,550
so about three o'clock in the morning or

1329
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:51,759
who knows when<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was like a motel</font>

1330
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:52,870
halfway to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stewart and we were going to</font>

1331
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,400
pull in there to see if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could get</font>

1332
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:56,650
some coffee make some phone I don't know

1333
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
what but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's continuing to snow so</font>

1334
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:00,130
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1335
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:03,490
really deep so this Greyhound bus has to

1336
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:06,070
make a right hand turn and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up</font>

1337
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:08,379
this hill into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parking lot of this</font>

1338
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:11,080
motel or something and the bus slides

1339
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:13,660
and it gets stuck like right in that

1340
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:17,049
depression where you go up and he

1341
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:20,980
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the bus going so like we're</font>

1342
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:22,810
sitting here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'll</font>

1343
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,490
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> credit I said why don't we all get</font>

1344
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:26,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lighting the bus and we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1345
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:28,719
push it on the ice or something so you

1346
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,730
have this cast of amazingly talented

1347
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:32,919
people getting out of this bus in the

1348
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:34,599
middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night in canada and lining</font>

1349
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,180
up on this side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Greyhound bus and</font>

1350
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:39,009
they start to push the bus where the bus

1351
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:40,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">driver put it in gear and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1352
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:42,370
got it moving so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he could get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1353
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:46,779
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in LA well we got into the lot and</font>

1354
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:48,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> motel was closed so we had to turn</font>

1355
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bus around and we got back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1356
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:52,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">road and we drove for another two or</font>

1357
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:54,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">three hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got into steward British</font>

comes out into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old the street he's</font>

1360
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,610
like welcoming us he's all bright-eyed

1361
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:02,710
bushy-tailed he slept and had coffee and

1362

we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know like we you know</font>

it was we were a mess from being up all

1364
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:11,200
night and and he said welcome to the

story that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our arrival in sturbridge</font>

1366
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:18,069
the conditions are almost unbelievable

1367
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:19,720
to imagine shooting the movie and I

1368
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">cactus um somehow there's a part of me</font>

1369
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that wonders how we ever survived it we</font>

1370
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:26,589
we had such problems all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way down to</font>

1371
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:29,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cameras we couldn't he had to leave</font>

1372
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:32,500
them in the cold because we couldn't

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from the warm out into the</font>

1374
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:37,389
cold inside and outside because the lens

1375
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:41,409
is brewed would be missed up I mean the

1376
01:03:37,389 --> 01:03:44,500
whole approach was one of just trying to

1377
01:03:41,409 --> 01:03:48,909
push this giant giant rock up a mountain

1378
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:51,579
we had we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had no comforts and it was a</font>

1379
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:53,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">dangerous spot make no mistake about it</font>

1380
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:56,440
we were in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very dangerous spot she can</font>

1381
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:58,539
miss me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that some of the</font>

1382
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,400
reality of that showed I know the cast

1383
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:02,500
members bonded together and they really

1384
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,039
became their characters they were really

1385
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,570
standing out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> snow dealing with</font>

1386
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:11,400
from there was a real camaraderie

1387
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:14,370
because these guys I mean they got the

1388
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:17,579
actors got into the business of being

1389
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:19,769
scientists working together thrown

1390
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:22,769
together I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine in the real</font>

1391
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:25,500
world a group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in an isolated</font>

1392
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:27,960
environment would have to pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

1393
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:31,079
and be friendly and we did some reach

1394
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,889
lots of research people go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for</font>

1395
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:37,319
long stays they bring cassettes and

1396
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:41,219
Records and books and that they would

1397
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:43,620
get flown in like videos of super bowl

1398
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:46,079
games and<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseball games the actors try</font>

1399
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:49,230
to mimic<font color="#CCCCCC"> them they tried to copy that</font>

1400
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's been some great scenes where all</font>

1401
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 men are looking at each other and</font>

1402
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:56,699
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who's who if if you</font>

1403
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:01,440
are my best friend or if you are about

1404
01:04:56,699 --> 01:05:04,919
to thing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on me and kill me but my</font>

1405
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,429
favorite thing in this whole picture is

1406
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:11,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to be up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in a location</font>

1407
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:14,339
like this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to shoot up</font>

1408
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:17,340
here it's unbelievably fantastic when

1409
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:20,700
the set was built and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it got snowed</font>

1410
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:25,170
in as we had hoped we were then going up

1411
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:26,969
a snowy icy dirt road one lane with the

1412
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:30,300
mining trucks coming down in radio

1413
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:32,489
contact back and forth so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trip up</font>

1414
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:37,560
each morning and back in the afternoon

1415
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:41,639
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evening was was sort of a long</font>

1416
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:43,679
tedious and sometimes kind of scary trip

1417
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:46,619
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those things that paid off</font>

1418
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,769
because you know we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put the</font>

1419
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:52,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">set in a location that we would not have</font>

1420
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:57,329
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to otherwise we lived in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1421
01:05:52,739 --> 01:06:00,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">town of Stewart it's the one of the last</font>

1422
01:05:57,329 --> 01:06:03,449
ice free port sigh believe so they

1423
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:06,869
floated Abe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I guess you'd call the</font>

1424
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:11,578
logging camp barge dormitory into the

1425
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:15,268
port and that was the crew housing

1426
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:18,749
it was a large flat barge that had<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1427
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:23,939
small cubicles ended with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with a bed</font>

1428
01:06:18,748 --> 01:06:26,189
and it was very much a kind of a you

1429
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:29,729
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> college dorm situation for the crew</font>

1430
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:31,708
and and it I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it made the</font>

1431
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:33,808
adventure more interesting you know

1432
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:37,108
there's a certain bonding that that

1433
01:06:33,809 --> 01:06:39,630
occurred with the the crew but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

1434
01:06:37,108 --> 01:06:43,199
it was not the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> luxurious conditions</font>

1435
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:47,519
the drive up from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the site on</font>

1436
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:50,489
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> glacier was about 45 minutes of</font>

1437
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:53,669
unbelievable stuff every day we passed a

1438
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:55,318
tan bald eagle seedings you know having

1439
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:57,420
just killed Sam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating them on the</font>

1440
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:59,489
side it on the snow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know blood</font>

1441
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered snow it was just amazing</font>

1442
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:09,568
everybody went up<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day so there are</font>

1443
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,369
many days she just SAT around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did</font>

1444
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:13,048
nothing except without the beautiful

1445
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:16,229
eyes that was the extraordinary thing we

1446
01:07:13,048 --> 01:07:18,538
even though it's 20 below the gear we

1447
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:20,968
wore after a few days of acclimation

1448
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:24,420
kept you warm and you could walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on</font>

1449
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:26,579
these fantastic glacial distance the

1450
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">three chords the way up this huge</font>

1451
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:33,599
glacier and that pale blue color the ice

1452
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:35,338
<font color="#CCCCCC">stretched for miles and miles and miles</font>

1453
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,338
and miles down as it sloped down into

1454
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:42,179
the valleys and white snow all around

1455
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:45,838
you and just hints of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> darkness of</font>

1456
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:47,518
mountaintops it's a sequence of images

1457
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgotten really powerful</font>

1458
01:07:47,518 --> 01:07:51,358
I've never been that high up for any

1459
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:53,579
length of time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the mountains in</font>

1460
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,548
there in that kind of cold weather it

1461
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:58,559
was just gorgeous so I felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets up</font>

1462
01:07:56,548 --> 01:08:01,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">your hands a tremendous feeling a place</font>

1463
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:04,140
which was important because the movies

1464
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:07,920
about on a psychological level is about

1465
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:10,348
isolation even though there were a

1466
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,798
number of us there each one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those men</font>

1467
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:16,920
at his own trap prison that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he lived</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1468
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:19,170
cut off from everything else except the

1469
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,618
guys around him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the introduction of</font>

1470
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:23,829
this alien which couldn't be seen but

1471
01:08:22,618 --> 01:08:27,338
could be sensed

1472
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:29,229
intensified that experience for each and

1473
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy in it and that that was I</font>

1474
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:33,459
thought the most interesting part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1475
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:38,920
movie for me in fact I felt my character

1476
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:41,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">dr. Norris new unconsciously that he had</font>

1477
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">been affected by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and in fact</font>

1478
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:47,199
in the sequence when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1479
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:48,670
side what to do when everybody's

1480
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:50,260
flipping out and run all around around

1481
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:52,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hallways and somebody i think it was</font>

1482
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:55,000
Tommy<font color="#CCCCCC"> weights his character had a gun</font>

1483
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:58,719
and to talk about me they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

1484
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:04,060
the control away from moffitt they asked

1485
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:05,650
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my character said I had no fellas</font>

1486
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:09,370
I just I just don't think I'm up to it

1487
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:11,949
in in my mind he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> responding to a</font>

1488
01:09:09,369 --> 01:09:14,949
signal from the inside you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1489
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:19,088
understand logically something's wrong

1490
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:20,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was the wrong guy and so anyway that</font>

1491
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:23,319
that business of being up there and

1492
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:27,309
seeing that it's sense that you were

1493
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:32,079
really alone nothing the wind cold all

1494
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:33,609
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> elements fabrics we won't have</font>

1495
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:35,649
that white situation over there running

1496
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:37,780
right so I think we'll be okay what we

1497
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:40,009
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> more might want to do it we could</font>

1498
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:41,988
just do a little fullback

1499
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:43,698
they're wearing a good idea to come back

1500
01:09:41,988 --> 01:09:45,919
out into here and then and then come

1501
01:09:43,698 --> 01:09:48,379
into situation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds good Megan</font>

1502
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,658

atmosphere on the set it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1506
01:09:55,988 --> 01:10:07,918
positive it was supportive and it was

1507
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:07,918
also it encouraged you to work hard

1508
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:22,519
Jonathan few directors who can walk on

1509
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:24,319
to a set and be faced<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the scene</font>

1510
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,929
that may involve five or six people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1511
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:29,658
some complicated blocking and with no

1512
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:31,310
preparation work with the actors and

1513
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:33,259
arrive<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a blocking that they're</font>

1514

<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not one that he</font>

dictates<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them and then decide on the</font>

spot what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most effective coverage</font>

1517
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:45,739
for that scene is going to be that's a

1518
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:47,929
rare talent in scenes as particular

1519
01:10:45,738 --> 01:10:51,649
scene I think which if insistent that

1520
01:10:47,929 --> 01:10:53,119
ability is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one in which the blood</font>

1521
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:55,759
was in the refrigerator they find a

01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clorox been broken open that's a</font>

1524
01:10:57,649 --> 01:11:00,769
difficult scene because you have a group

1525
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,050
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the semicircle up against a</font>

1526
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,880
flat object and if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

1527
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,670
that's an exceptional challenge to shoot

1528
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:10,039
effectively I mean one can take an easy

1529
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,440
pop out shoot it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> within the closure</font>

1530
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:14,420
of the half circle if you will and take

1531
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:16,579
individuals on each but I think if you

1532
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:18,619
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that scene it's much more</font>

1533
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:21,829
complicated in terms of how he chose to

1534
01:11:18,619 --> 01:11:23,390
cover it i was very impressed with with

1535
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:25,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that scene and the one that followed</font>

1536
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:27,020
where windows runs down the hallway

1537
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:28,429
what's the gun which i think is one of

1538
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">my favorite scenes in terms of cutting</font>

1539
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:35,539
those two scenes in particular and<font color="#CCCCCC"> jon</font>

1540
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:39,079
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets just the right angles very</font>

1541
01:11:35,539 --> 01:11:40,819
rarely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't ever really think of a</font>

1542
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:44,630
time which i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say gee I wish I had</font>

1543
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:47,829
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> orgy I wish I had and that's a</font>

1544
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:47,829
testimony to his ability

1545
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:17,059
the reviews were mixed I think with the

1546
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:18,590
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

1547
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:23,060
alternate ending to the film that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1548
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:24,380
shot I'd spoken to John about this I had

1549
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,740
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought well gee this is a</font>

1550
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:29,569
terribly nihilistic ending very much of

1551
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:31,760
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> downbeat perhaps we should protect</font>

1552
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:35,119
ourselves while we have the principal

1553
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,869
courage and just shoot an ending that

1554
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:40,309
where we see that he survives and John

1555
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:43,579
was open to this so essentially what he

1556
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:47,150
did was he staged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scene in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Curt</font>

1557
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:49,579
has been rescued<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seeing in a kind of</font>

1558
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:51,289
small office structure and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had</font>

1559
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:54,829
a blood test so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that he's</font>

1560
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:58,250
not infected and he has survived this

1561
01:12:54,829 --> 01:13:01,100
ordeal rather than the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mutual</font>

1562
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:04,189
death that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> concludes the film now</font>

1563
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:07,910
he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot this for protection we</font>

1564
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:09,949
never previewed this the issue did come

1565
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:14,539
up at the conclusion of the two previews

1566
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:17,720
as to whether we should perhaps try this

1567
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:20,300
ending see how it it flew with the

1568
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:24,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">audiences and or make other adjustments</font>

1569
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:26,239
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> film and I think John essentially</font>

1570
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:27,890
at that time was about that he had

1571
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:31,880
achieved in the movie what he wanted to

1572
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:33,320
do he had made the story of who goes

1573
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,909
there the short story from which the

1574
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:36,859
original thing was adapting was much

1575
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:39,439
truer to that which i think was one of

1576
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:41,089
his intentions he was a great fan of the

1577
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:42,349
original thing he and I watched it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1578
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">least two or three times I'm John</font>

1579
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:46,280
striving<font color="#CCCCCC"> scene at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 and it is a</font>

1580
01:13:44,569 --> 01:13:49,279
wonderful film but he wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1581
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:51,349
do that film he was in a sense trying to

1582
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:52,699
go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source of it I</font>

1583
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he filled he felt he had</font>

1584
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:58,130
accomplished that and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the way</font>

1585
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,779
the film went out a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

1586
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:02,000
though that bothered the audience more

1587
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:04,130
than the monster were the poking around

1588
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,649
the monster<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and poking around</font>

1589
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:08,810
human beings that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been burnt and it</font>

1590
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:12,429
was like we all associated to it in

1591
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:18,429
terms of looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a deer</font>

1592
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:21,819
it doesn't it's part of life hunt and

1593
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:23,859
you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> me you got the deer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

1594
01:14:21,819 --> 01:14:24,819
it's I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's ugly the first two or</font>

1595
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,198
three times you do it but then after a

1596
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:28,058
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that's what you do with the</font>

1597
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:31,448
you take them out you remove them and

1598
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:33,760
clean it get the meat clean then you cut

1599
01:14:31,448 --> 01:14:35,618
the meat up all that kind of when you're

1600
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,639
doing it you if somebody's not used to

1601
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:39,158
doing they look at that my god this is

1602
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,059
this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is horrible but then I'm</font>

1603
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:42,848
any problem going to the store and

1604
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:44,349
buying that rap piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> meat so they</font>

1605
01:14:42,849 --> 01:14:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">just don't see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other part of it so</font>

1606
01:14:44,349 --> 01:14:47,708
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie you see that part we</font>

1607
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:50,529
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those parts were probably</font>

1608
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:53,618
going to be to a large degree rejected

1609
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:57,340
again I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was great that John</font>

1610
01:14:53,618 --> 01:15:01,208
didn't stop doing the movie that he set

1611
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:04,389
out to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm very happy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1612
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:06,038
movie did find its audience and that it

1613
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:09,309
found its audience 20 years or 15 years

1614
01:15:06,038 --> 01:15:12,069
later was it to a great degree expected

1615
01:15:09,309 --> 01:15:14,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people always come up to me and say you</font>

1616
01:15:12,069 --> 01:15:16,840
know I you know my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie you</font>

1617
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,849
were in was I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times this</font>

1618
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,639
happens but they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with the thing</font>

1619
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:26,860
is the thing as the thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they like</font>

1620
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:30,340
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a you know as someone</font>

1621
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:32,708
else's probably said this film found its

1622
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:35,828
audience not in the theaters at the time

1623
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:38,889
it wasn't a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit it did okay but in</font>

1624
01:15:35,828 --> 01:15:43,149
video and on cable and since then on

1625
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:47,800
video it's that it has a very loyal very

1626
01:15:43,149 --> 01:15:49,538
intense following and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always fun</font>

1627
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,269
i mean i've been involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in several of</font>

1628
01:15:49,538 --> 01:15:54,728
those that haven't gone through the roof

1629
01:15:52,269 --> 01:15:57,039
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box office but in certain ways</font>

1630
01:15:54,729 --> 01:16:00,030
have an afterlife that's much stronger

1631
01:15:57,038 --> 01:16:03,809
than films that have gone through the

1632
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:06,210
surface it was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much fun to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be with</font>

1633
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that cast and that director and that</font>

1634
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:14,189
crew I mean you had like 60 little boys

1635
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:17,250
with helicopters and flamethrowers and

1636
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:20,579
guns a monster and we're up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1637
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:22,619
Arctic and I mean it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gas man it</font>

1638
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:24,359
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like going out and</font>

1639
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:26,279
playing cops and robbers when you were a

1640
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:31,710
kid it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a fantastic</font>

1641
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:37,019
experience in a in a wild and

1642
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:38,939
unpredictable place with that Justin

1643
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:41,640
once again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say it just a</font>

1644
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:44,729
tremendous casting crew it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1645
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:47,070
much fun it's a good film and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1646
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:50,849
turtle<font color="#E5E5E5"> survived for that reason you know</font>

1647
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:53,519
might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an instant success but I</font>

1648
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:57,150
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it has legs in the sense that</font>

1649
01:16:53,520 --> 01:17:00,210
people will enjoy and probably more so

1650
01:16:57,149 --> 01:17:04,049
as yours I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time when</font>

1651
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:08,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing was released it it was an</font>

1652
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:13,829
innovative very kind of unusual journey

1653
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:16,350
for an audience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that it came</font>

1654
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:20,460
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting phenomenon which</font>

1655
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:22,800
was at the time we also had a very

1656
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:27,989
friendly alien that came to visit the

1657
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:30,650
earth in the form of ET and it was was a

1658
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:33,829
case of an audience

1659
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:36,500
at the time feeling probably more

1660
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:41,029
comfortable with the friendly alien and

1661
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:44,090
back that you know the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dark edge</font>

1662
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:48,469
of the thing was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't</font>

1663
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">so appreciated at the time I think the</font>

1664
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:54,619
the audience's sensibilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> have always</font>

1665
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:58,909
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change and they're now sort of</font>

1666
01:17:54,619 --> 01:18:01,670
prepared to accept an alien<font color="#E5E5E5"> that isn't</font>

1667
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:03,170
so friendly in the shape of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing I</font>

1668
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:06,469
really believe that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had</font>

1669
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:08,989
separated the releases amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

1670
01:18:06,469 --> 01:18:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been a big hit at the box office it</font>

1671
01:18:08,988 --> 01:18:13,939
since turned into what they call a cult

1672
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:18,529
don't seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody had seen it</font>

1673
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:21,529
video or on television or something it's

1674
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:23,929
it set a standard for special effects i

1675
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:26,389
think that the people who like that kind

1676
01:18:23,929 --> 01:18:28,609
of movie went and saw it anyway the

1677
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:30,140
interesting thing about the thing right

1678
01:18:28,609 --> 01:18:32,389
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact that it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1679
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:34,520
done a long time ago you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people</font>

1680
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually think that that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1681
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:40,250
imaging and the special effects and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1682
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:42,560
creature work would ever hold up to this

1683
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:44,300
day even in even in the light of the

1684
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,550
fact that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are computer</font>

1685
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,469
graphics and things now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think part</font>

1686
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:50,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the reason for that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's</font>

1687
01:18:48,469 --> 01:18:53,239
you know you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't beat wild</font>

1688
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:55,340
imagination you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter how</font>

1689
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:58,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do it as long as it's executed very</font>

1690
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:01,610
well you know it that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't</font>

1691
01:18:58,189 --> 01:19:04,189
pierce through the magic you know

1692
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:06,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funny because i</font>

1693
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:08,629
watched a movie now and I can completely

1694
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,789
pick it apart you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I can</font>

1695
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look at it and go you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

1696
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:15,289
that differently now you know I could do

1697
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that better you know but but the fun</font>

1698
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:19,219
thing is is that everybody that you know

1699
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:21,530
like I run into on the street or<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1700
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:24,380
movie business or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1701
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:28,579
say do you realize that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know your</font>

1702
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:30,920
monster creation and the thing was a

1703
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:32,569
life-changing monster and I go what does

1704
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,640
that mean and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I even have</font>

1705
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:37,158
kids that actually grew up watching it

1706
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:40,550
on video and they say yeah it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1707
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:42,460
so crazy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and it just sort of</font>

1708
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:44,770
made us realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

1709
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:46,930
anything in the movies you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so it</font>

1710
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:48,730
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fun to have you know that you</font>

1711
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:50,350
know part in history is you know having

1712
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:52,718
made something that was so wildly

1713
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:55,270
imaginative that it's actually you know

1714
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,159
caused others to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with greater</font>

1715
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:00,010
premiums there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> movies that you</font>

1716
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:02,349
do I've done more I guess than my fair

1717
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:03,730
share of them and I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1718
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:05,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that I have to sort of look</font>

1719
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:08,468
at that and realize something that I

1720
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:10,238
have a tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like movies that</font>

1721
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:13,029
aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna perhaps be accepted at the</font>

1722
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,799
time and if they're done well though

1723
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:16,269
they will be accepted later on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1724
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:20,409
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with the advent of video</font>

1725
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:22,360
that's that's a great I i I'm very happy

1726
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:23,920
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because ultimately you're</font>

1727
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:27,279
making movies for the enjoyment of as

1728
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:29,440
many people as possible and I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1729
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:31,300
there's video and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can take</font>

1730
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:33,969
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make their judgment later on and</font>

1731
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,770
perhaps without the politics of the time

1732
01:20:33,969 --> 01:20:38,529
or without whatever's in the air at the

1733
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:41,500
time to set a tone to get in the way of

1734
01:20:38,529 --> 01:20:45,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the project and just the story</font>

1735
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:48,579
itself there's a very somber a<font color="#E5E5E5"> somber</font>

1736
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:50,079
kind of inevitability to the film as it

1737
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:52,930
begins you're seeing a helicopter

1738
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:55,510
whirring and they're chasing a dog and

1739
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:58,719
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i feels like the end of the</font>

1740
01:20:55,510 --> 01:21:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and that's what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is an</font>

1741
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,890
apocalyptic movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the first of</font>

1742
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:05,409
three films that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on that</font>

1743
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:06,640
have an apocalyptic theme I've dealt

1744
01:21:05,409 --> 01:21:08,319
with them in different ways this is the

1745
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,650
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come from</font>

1746
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:14,309
bombs dropping

1747
01:21:10,649 --> 01:21:16,439
it comes from within and it was a movie

1748
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:20,190
that that's tone started and and

1749
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:22,559
finished and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it was almost</font>

1750
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:24,960
there's nothing you can do because here

1751
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,360
it comes and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the thing is a</font>

1752
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,969
metaphor for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you want to say</font>

1753
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,039
it's disease could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aids could be</font>

1754
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:37,590
whatever it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from within you it's</font>

1755
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:40,050
all so basically the lack of trust that

1756
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's in the world now we see it all</font>

1757
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:43,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">over countries people we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

1758
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:46,890
each other anymore we don't know who to

1759
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:49,320
trust we're with<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody that that we</font>

1760
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:52,920
think may be there are loved ones and

1761
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:55,198
they may attack us and that's what the

1762
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:58,699
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it has a lot of truth in and</font>

1763
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,698
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dressed up as a monster movie</font>

1764
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,020
