now the ladies mr. Holmes

20
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,868
what do you think may have perpetrated
this offer crime

21
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:15,729
well to put it by simply in layman's
terms easily understandable to nuns I

22
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:20,590
believe this to be the work of thieves
all patent is very reminiscent to pass

23
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,729
blocking is where i found thieves to be
involved the tell-tale loss of property

24
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:31,149
the snatching away of substances it all
points to slaves but how can you find

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,409
such a person

26
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,639
well i'm using a wonderful new system
not even going to Scotland Yard i'll

27
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,349
call it picture fit

28
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,750
oh yes that's when you piece together
the face of the criminal isn't it unless

29
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,030
know i can only piece together the
appearance of the face of the terminal i

30
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,140
cannot piece together the actual face
shot good because of course once you

31
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:57,939
catch the criminal face the other
criminal parts are not hard to find the

32
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,289
criminal body being situated directly
beneath the criminal face join of course

33
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:10,030
but the criminal Nick so the relic is
lost forever on the country you have fun

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,600
hello we are living in the 20th century
at me

69

it that a monstrous boot available Hound

70
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,620
of Hell has been the death of every
single master of Baskerville Hall

patient for a great number of years

73
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,180
during which time he was complete the
same but as the years went by he became

74
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,168
somewhat of a rituals really leaving his
estate and building a huge fence around

75
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:48,889
the whole of the property he became
completely and madly obsessed with the

76
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,668
idea that the legendary Hound of the
Baskervilles was going to return to

77
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:53,959
destroy him

78
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,370

00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:10,889
down for one moment please mr. spiggott
there you are applying why you not for

446
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:22,500
the job on the walls as a loner right
mr. spiggott Oh you don't noticing

447
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,230
almost immediately

448
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,469
well that you are a one Liddy domain

449
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,230
how are you at United's camp when you've
been in the business as long as I have

450
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:40,679
mr. spiggott you get to notice these
little things almost instinctively yeah

451
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,440
well your parenting children never
suspect that you a one-legged man are

452
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,570
applying for the job of the sauna and I
a job

453
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:56,369
traditionally associated with a
two-legged man

454
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:05,910
yes and yet you a you Dexter applying
for the job I have a job for which two

455
00:48:05,909 --> 00:48:11,190
legs would seem to be the minimum
requirement

456
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:18,420
well mr. spiggott need I point out to
you with overmuch emphasis where your

457
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:26,340
deficiency lies as the gods landing the
job can't make your 10 is perhaps oil

458
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,850
need also you with too much stress that
it is

459
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:37,449
the labor division that you are
deficient the leg division the leg

460
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:43,689
division mr. spiggott you are deficient
in the leg division to the tune of one

461
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:53,200
your light leg I like it's a lovely leg
for the job as soon as i saw it coming

462
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,460
on sat alone

463
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,460
what a lovely leg for the job

464
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:04,869
I've got nothing against you lightly the
trouble is neither have you

465
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:15,010
you fall down on the left our meaning
and click it seeing as that's what mr.

466
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:21,700
spiggott study and in my view the site
of a one-legged wanna hopping across the

467
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:29,259
malls might draw unwanted attention but
the despair mr. spiggott I mean after

468
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:37,270
all you score over a man with no legs at
all but one hundred percent uh yeah I

469
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:41,500
got twice as many exactly so that's no
help

470
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,360
of course there is still hope mr.
spiggott I mean if i get no two-legged

471
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:53,470
runners in here with inside the next 18
months there is every chance that you a

472
00:49:53,469 --> 00:49:59,469
uni Dexter will be the very type of
person I should be attempted to contact

473
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:02,889
these RVs the job

474
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:07,179
wow I'm just sorry I can't be more
definite at this stage but you must

475
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:11,139
understand that the description exactly
is very precise work that and I'll call

476
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:18,460
the court but like any of this
whatsoever you misfigured oh one thing

477
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:21,349
mr. speaker

478
00:50:21,349 --> 00:51:14,359
